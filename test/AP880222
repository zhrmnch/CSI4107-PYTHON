<HEAD>Socialist Party Leadership Suggests Waldheim Must Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Socialist Party leadership on Monday
strongly suggested President Kurt Waldheim should step down but
stopped short of calling for his resignation.
   Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, party chief Fred Sinowatz and other
party leaders also renewed an indirect offer to support a
conservative candidate to be nominated for presidential elections
if Waldheim quits.
   The resolution adopted by the Socialist leadership meeting said
the report of a historians' commission on Waldheim's service in the
German army during World War II had ``badly shaken the president's
moral authority at home and abroad.''
   It also said that a televised speech by Waldheim on Feb. 15
``has raised doubts about his ability to integrate'' Austria's
opposing political camps.
   In that speech, Waldheim said he would not step down and
dismissed as wrong unspecified parts of the report earlier this
month by the international panel of historians that probed his
wartime past.
   Waldheim, 69, has consistently denied any wrongdoing as a first
lieutenant serving in the German army in the Balkans during the war.
   The resolution said the Socialists are ready, together with the
conservative People's Party, junior partner in the coalition
government, to ``look for a way toward a new beginning in the
office of federal president.''
   Asked whether this meant that the Socialists would agree to a
joint conservative presidential candidate, Sinowatz told reporters
``this certainly includes also the question whether a personnel
change is possible.''
   Economics Minister Robert Graf and other leading officials of
the conservative People's Party last week expressed increasing
uneasiness in the party about the damage being done to the country
if Waldheim clings to his post. Waldheim, elected in 1986, ends his
term in 1992.
   The historians' commission presented no evidence that would
clearly back allegations Waldheim committed atrocities, but it left
open the question of whether he was guilty of any crime.
   It said he was ``in close proximity'' to some Nazi atrocities in
the Balkans, knew they were going on and made no attempt ot prevent
them. It also said Waldheim concealed his wartime past and tried to
make it seem harmless once he could no longer hide it.

<HEAD>Polls Point to Wide Lead for Bush In South</HEAD>

   Vice President George Bush holds a 2-1
lead over chief rival Sen. Bob Dole in the 14 Southern and border
states that hold primaries on March 8, Super Tuesday, a poll
indicated Monday.
   On the Democratic side, Jesse Jackson and Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis were running roughly even in the South, the Scripps
Howard News Service survey suggested.
   Dukakis was the nationwide favorite among Democrats, according
to another poll, this one by CBS News and The New York Times.
According to that survey, Dukakis had 21 percent; Jackson 13
percent; Rep. Richard Gephardt had 12 percent and former Colorado
Sen. Gary Hart 10 percent.
   Jackson and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. were the leaders in
the Southern and border Super Tuesday states, garnering 19 percent
and 16 percent respectively, the CBS-New York Times poll said.
Dukakis had 13 percent; Gephardt 11 percent and Hart 10 percent,
the CBS-Times poll indicated.
   In the Scripps Howard survey, Bush led Dole by a 51-26 margin,
with former television evangelist Pat Robertson was third with 11
percent. Rep. Jack Kemp of New York trailed with 3 percent and 9
percent were undecided, the poll indicated.
   In the CBS-New York Times poll of Super Tuesday states plus
South Carolina, findings were similar: 51 percent for Bush to 20
percent for Dole. In the nationwide sampling the survey found 42
percent opting for Bush and 27 percent for Dole.
   The Scripps Howard pollsters contacted 423 likely Republican
voters Feb. 17-19, just after New Hampshire's Feb. 16 primary. The
margin of error on the GOP side was 5 percentage points, the news
service said.
   Bush won the New Hampshire primary, eight days after a bruising
third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses behind Dole and Robertson.
   Among Democrats, the Scripps Howard survey gave Jackson 22
percent and Dukakis 19 percent _ within the poll's 4
percentage-point margin of error. Dukakis was the decisive winner
of the New Hampshire primary.
   Gore, who has pinned his hopes on a strong showing in the South,
and Gephardt, the Missouri congressman who won the Iowa caucuses
and placed second in New Hampshire, each had 14 percent, and 21
percent were undecided, the news service said.
   Hart had 6 percent, the Scripps Howard poll indicated, and Sen.
Paul Simon of Illinois drew the backing of 5 percent. On the
Democratic side, 597 voters were surveyed during the same time
period as the Republican polling.
   The Scripps Howard survey involved voters in Alabama, Arkansas,
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi,
Missouri, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia,
all of which hold primaries or caucuses on March 8. Six other
states hold primaries or caucuses that day as well.
   The Scripps Howard survey was done in conjunction with the
Birmingham (Ala.) Post-Herald, The Commercial Appeal of Memphia and
The Knoxville (Tenn.) News Sentinel.
   The telephone poll of 2,734 adults nationwide for CBS and the
Times was taken Feb. 17-21 has a margin of error of plus or minus
three percentage points on the Democratic side and four points for
the GOP race.
   The CBS-Times Super Tuesday figures have a margin of error of
four percentage points for the Democrats and five points for the
Republicans.

<HEAD>No Bon Jovi, No REM _ Grammys Ignore Critics and Charts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight million Americans can be wrong.
   That's how many people bought Bon Jovi's album ``Slippery When
Wet,'' which spent 38 weeks in the Top 5 of the album charts and
churned out three hit singles.
   But the boys from New Jersey received a goose egg from the
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which deemed
``Slippery When Wet'' worthy of zero Grammy nominations. And it's
not just the platinum-haired, platinum-sellers the academy ignores:
Critical favorites can and often do suffer the same fate.
   The Beatles, one of the most popular and prolific musical
entities of the century, were often ignored by the academy, winning
only four Grammys as a group. The Rolling Stones have never won a
Grammy.
   REM, the acclaimed band from Athens, Ga., broke nationally with
their ``Document'' album and its single, ``The One I Love''; their
album also received no nominations. However, the LP cover was
nominated for best album package.
   An assortment of artists, from John Cougar Mellencamp to The
Beastie Boys, missed out on musical nominations for the March 2
show at Radio City Music Hall, passed over by a membership which
``once more opted for studio craft over originality and vision,''
wrote Los Angeles Times music critic Robert Hilburn.
   ``You know what it is? It's just the way it is. You can't fight
city hall,'' said rocker Richard Marx, who was snubbed for a best
new artist nomination on a technicality.
   ``It does tend to be the same kind of people every year,'' he
said. ``A lot of times it's the people who've been on the cover of
Time, or the real mainstream people. The artistic people are passed
over many times.''
   For Marx, it was an obscure track he recorded for a B-movie
soundtrack that prevented his new artist nomination. A similar
controversy arose in 1986 when the academy refused to nominate
Whitney Houston in the best new artist category because she had
recorded duets with Jermaine Jackson and Teddy Pendergrass. She
went on to win the best female pop vocal Grammy for ``Saving All My
Love for You.''
   But Crosby, Stills & Nash, who won the award in 1969, had been
vocalists and songwriters in the Byrds, Buffalo Springfield and the
Hollies. Cyndi Lauper, who won in 1985, recorded as lead vocalist
with a group called Blue Angel before her ``She's So Unusual'' LP.
And Freddie Jackson, who was nominated in that category in 1986,
had been a part of a recording group called Mystic Merlin.
   Nevertheless, singer Jody Watley _ who scored several hits while
recording with the band Shalimar _ was nominated as a new artist
this year.
   ``I was upset for about five minutes when I found out. Then I
thought, `Well, no big deal. I'll get nominated for a Grammy
someday,''' said Marx, who wound up nominated this year for best
rock vocal with his track, ``Don't Mean Nothing.''
   His competition in that category includes Joe Cocker, Tina
Turner, Bob Seger and superstar Bruce Springsteen. But even The
Boss was a victim of the fickle Grammy selection process.
   Springsteen's ``Tunnel of Love,'' his first studio album in
three years, was passed over for album for the year honors. But
``Paradise by the C,'' an old tune recycled on Springsteen's
five-record live set, inexplicably received a best rock
instrumental nomination.
   In fact, Springsteen has received only one Grammy Award, despite
such multimillion selling and critically hailed albums as ``Born to
Run,'' ``The River'' and ``Born in the USA.''
   As for Mellencamp, his fine ``The Lonesome Jubilee'' received no
nominations; Mellencamp received a co-nomination for producer of
the year with his studio partner, Don Gehman.
   Springsteen's office has declined to comment on the nomination
process, which is handled by the 5,000-member NARAS. The selection
of nominees and the winners annually produces complaints from those
passed over, although many artists remain philosophical about the
whole process.
   ``Look at all the people who won in the best new artist category
in the past _ the Starland Vocal Band, A Taste of Honey,'' said
Marx. ``That award can be the kiss of death.''

   Harold Thomas works in a junkyard six days
a week, tearing apart old cars and rebuilding the engines. The
other day is spent working in the fields at a church-run orphanage,
where his benefactors have volunteered his service.
   Roy Gilman, 75, and his wife, Ethel, 68, gave him the job and a
chance to leave the lean-to he was living in last month with other
homeless men in Chicago.
   They gave him the old 8-foot-by-30-foot trailer home at the
junkyard that he shares with a stray cat he's named Cleo.
   They have their son Ralph drive him to church on Sundays.
   They pay for his groceries, but they haven't paid him any wages
yet.
   ``Those Gilmans believe in working,'' Thomas says, adding that a
paycheck will probably come when business picks up.
   ``A month from now, it'll be planting season,'' he says. ``I
think I'll do good. I'm fed, I'm healthy, I'm working.''
   Room and board are Thomas's pay for now, Ralph Gilman says.
Thomas will be paid ``when he gets where he can do anything. ... I
think we're going in the hole part of the time now.''
   Thomas is a stranger in a strange land, and the circumstances
that brought him here on Jan. 16 were just as strange.
   Before he arrived in this ranching and farming community of
about 11,000 people on the flat high plains of eastern New Mexico,
Thomas lived in a rotting wood and canvas shack along the Chicago
River. He didn't have a job and he got his meals when he could. A
2-inch scar across his forehead is testimony to a fight he says
started in a soup line in Chicago.
   The Gilmans read of Thomas' plight in an Associated Press story
published in the Portales News-Tribune in January, contacted the AP
bureau in Chicago and said if Thomas was willing to work they'd
provide him with a home and a job.
   By the time Thomas, 35, was on a westbound Greyhound people had
donated new clothes, new luggage and spending money.
   Thomas isn't completely at ease in his new surroundings.
   He isn't quite sure how people will react to him.
   He shunned a suggestion of one restaurant for dinner, saying
he'd heard ``rough cowboys'' hung out there.
   Thomas likes to talk about his past. He speaks with animation of
his days as a wanderer, traveling through the South looking for
work.
   He speaks also of a future when he will own his own ranch.
   But for now, he goes to work at the junkyard each day and says
he enjoys the time he spends in the fields at the orphanage.
   When the director of the orphanage drives up to the remains of
an old corral that Thomas is sawing into firewood, Thomas quickly
extinguishes his cigarette in his calloused hand, saying putting it
out is the respectful thing to do.
   ``New Mexico is nice and warm,'' he says. ``I want to stay here
and try to make something out of this opportunity.
   ``I ain't getting no younger. I want to settle down.''
   Since his arrival, Thomas has received dozens of letters: from
women who've read of his good fortune and want to share life with
him, from homeless people wishing him well in his new life, from 28
fifth graders in Corrales, N.M.
   The Gilmans also get letters _ mostly commending them for
offering Thomas the opportunity to work again and to have a roof
over his head.
   Thomas, a burly 5-foot-10-inch former carpenter, answers his
letters, particularly those from the women. ``I get lonely for a
woman,'' he says.
   Mrs. Gilman saves her letters in a notebook that she likes to
show visitors.
   People in the community have been receptive to Thomas, she says,
but adds: ``So many people want his place if he doesn't work out.
If he doesn't get started drinking, he'll be all right.''
   Thomas isn't drinking. He can't go out to bars at night because
the 16-year-old car the Gilmans gave him doesn't have an engine
yet. But he's learning the skills he'll need to get it in working
order.
   Ralph Gilman says Thomas is a good worker but still needs time
to adjust to his new job.
   ``Some things could be better,'' he says. ``I think there's a
communication gap, but a bunch of that is probably my fault. He
can't read my mind.
   ``A lot of it is the way he's lived,'' Gilman says. ``His brain
has worked on survival for the last couple of years. He's got to
develop it for this now.''
   Thomas begins each day at 8 a.m. by helping feed the half dozen
cows that also live at the junkyard.
   When warm weather comes he'll help with ranching chores on the
approximately 2,000 acres the Gilmans own in several tracts.
   ``He's not completely satisfied. I can tell,'' Ralph Gilman
says. ``Other days things are good. There's ups and downs.''
   Thomas says the downs come mostly when he begins missing his
longtime girlfriend and her 16-year-old daughter he helped raise.
They live in a government housing project in Chicago.
   ``I want to help my stepdaughter out, she's pregnant,'' he says.
``I'd like to try and save my money and do something for my own.
I'd like to bring them down here.
   ``I never knew I'd end up like I did,'' he says. ``I hope I
don't end up in a slump like that again. That ain't no kind of life
for a man.''

   British actor Dudley Moore, who staggered
to fame as a lovable lush in the movie ``Arthur,'' has married
aspiring actress Brogan Lane, a week after his Valentine's Day
proposal, his agent said.
   Moore, 52, and Miss Lane, 28, were married Sunday by a justice
of the peace at The Little Church of the West Chapel, said agent
Lou Pitt.
   Moore met Miss Lane six years ago on the set of the film ``Six
Weeks,'' according to publicist Paul Bloch. They were re-introduced
three years ago at a restaurant and have been together since.
   Moore's marriages to actresses Suzy Kendall and Tuesday Weld
ended in divorce. It was Miss Lane's second marriage. Each has a
son.
   ``The two hope to star in a film together in the future and are
looking for projects,'' said Bloch.

   Pianist Van Cliburn says he stopped
playing in public in 1978 because he needed a short rest.
   Cliburn broke his long silence with a White House performance
during December's summit meeting between President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``To be honest, I never thought the `intermission' would go on
for 10 years,'' Cliburn said in an interview published in Sunday's
Dallas Morning News. ``I guess it went on so long because I felt
relaxed and was having such a good time simply living.''
   Since the White House performance, he has had numerous offers
but has so far accepted only one _ conductor Zubin Mehta's
invitation to accompany the New York Philharmonic on its first tour
of the Soviet Union in 15 years.
   Cliburn will appear as soloist with the orchestra in concerts in
Leningrad and Moscow during May and June, 30 years after he won the
Tchaikovsky International Competition.
   He said he would perform in his home state of Texas next season.

   Miss Matlin, who won an Oscar for best actress for her portrayal
of a deaf-mute in ``Children of a Lesser God,'' will be presenting
this year's best actor award. She plans to say, ``The envelope,

   She also has a speaking role in the planned CBS movie with Anne

   Filmmaker John Waters says there are
similarities between his first PG-rated movie and his 1972 midnight
classic ``Pink Flamingos,'' which is still outraging audiences.
   ``Hairspray,'' a comedy about an overweight girl who becomes a
star on a local television dance show, makes its debut this week.
Divine, the 300-pound transvestite star of ``Pink Flamingos'' plays
the mother of the heroine of ``Hairspray.''
   ``I knew this was one of the few obsessions I ever had that
would be palatable to (general) movie executives,'' the 41-year-old
Waters said of ``Hairspray'' in an interview published Sunday in
The New York Times.
   ``The sensibility and sense of humor in `Hairspray' is the same
of `Pink Flamingos.' The difference is that I don't have the rage
at 41. I'd be a jerk.''

   In her ``Saturday Night Live'' heyday, Gilda
Radner poked fun at people and just about everything else, but when
she learned 17 months ago that she had cancer she found life was
not as funny.
   ``Cancer is about the most unfunny thing in the world,'' Radner
said in an interview in March's Life magazine. ``But it doesn't
have to mean you die.''
   Although Radner had lost much weight and hair during her
chemotherapy, she has a new attitude today.
   ``Radner needs little provocation to yank up her sweater and
show off her newly `fat' stomach, and after eight months of
baldness, her unruly brown hair (with a bit of gray at the temples)
has grown back in a thick thatch,'' according to the magazine.
   She has also stopped smoking and eats more wholesome food.
   Twenty years ago, the average life expectancy of a patient with
ovarian cancer was between six and seven months. It is still the
most lethal of pelvic cancers, with less than a 30 percent recovery
rate.
   Although Radner, 41, will not be considered well unless her
remission continues for at least 1{ years, she said ``I think I've
never been as healthy and as well as I am now.''
   She credits her turnaround to her excruciating medical
treatment, which included surgery, nine months of chemotherapy
injections and 30 radiation sessions.
   Her 52-year-old husband, actor Gene Wilder, said: ``Each time
Gilda had to go through one more treatment, and she'd be vomiting
and writhing in pain, I'd ask myself, `How much can a human being
take?'''
   Had Wilder not been around, Radner is certain she could not have
taken so much, the magazine said. Wilder has not worked since she
was diagnosed.
   Radner also credits meetings she's attending with the ``Wellness
Community,'' a cancer self-help group.
   And she's working three hours a day on a book about cancer.
   ``That's what one of my favorite visualizations is about,'' she
said. ``Every day ... I imagine myself sitting in Doubleday's, with
people lined up to have me sign my book. I'm well. And I'm
adorable.''

   Jimmy Swaggart didn't spare the
fire-and-brimstone when fellow TV evangelists Jim Bakker and Marvin
Gorman fell from power last year. He criticized them for their
style as well as their sexual dalliances.
   ``God deliver us from these pompadour boys, hair done, nails
done, fresh from the beauty shop, preaching the gospel,'' he
thundered in March at a California crusade.
   Swaggart, who temporarily stepped down from his own ministry
Sunday amid allegations of sexual misconduct, has a less polished,
more explosive fundamentalist style. It sprang, perhaps, from his
upbringing in Ferriday, a backwater town in northern Louisiana's
Bible belt.
   It was there, he has said, when he first heard the call of God _
a voice that gave him goose bumps and made his hair tingle.
   He was 8 years old.
   ``Everything seemed different after that day in front of the
Arcade Theater,'' he said in a 1985 interview. ``I felt better
inside. Almost like taking a bath.''
   He grew up poor and learned to play the piano and sing along
with two cousins who took different paths _ rock singer Jerry Lee
Lewis and country singer Mickey Gilley.
   Part-time preaching and part-time work in oil fields provided
his living until he was 23, when he gave up the oil work. He
preached, played piano and sang gospel songs with all the
barrelhouse fervor of his cousin Jerry Lee at Assemblies of God
revivals and camp meetings for 16 years before starting a radio
show that launched his broadcast evangelism career.
   He was always outspoken.
   In literature issued by his ministry he calls Roman Catholicism
``a false religion. It is not the Christian way. Whosoever follows
its errant doctrines will be deceived and end up eternally lost.''
   Of Jews, he wrote that ``because of their rejection of Christ
... they have known sorrow and heartache like have no other people
on the face of the Earth.''
   ``If you don't like what I say, talk to my boss!'' he shouted
once as he strode in front of his congregation at his Family
Worship Center, where his sermons often move listeners to stand up
as though possessed by the Holy Spirit and start speaking in
tongues.
   Offensive to some, Swaggart's messages still moved many.
Contributors built Jimmy Swaggart Ministries into a growth industry
that made an estimated $142 million in 1986. Swaggart said in 1985
that his complex in Baton Rouge _ including a worship center, Bible
college and state-of-the-art broadcasting and recording facilities
_ was worth up to $75 million.
   Swaggart has said the PTL scandals of last year hurt
fund-raising because the public painted all evangelists with a
broad brush.
   As the scandal broke, Swaggart assured his followers that he
wouldn't fall into the same trap as Bakker and Gorman, a New
Orleans minister.
   In his Baton Rouge worship center in March he told his flock
that if he were ever unfaithful to his wife, Frances, she would
``kill me before God could even get to me.''
   On Sunday, Swaggart never specifially responded to reports that
he, too, had been accused of sexual misconduct, specifically
consorting with a prostitute. But, as his tearful followers looked
on, he turned to his wife and said, ``God never gave a man a better
helpmate, a companion to stand beside him. I have sinned against
you and I beg your forgiveness.''

   Some facts and figures on the Assemblies of God church:
   _ Founded in 1914 during a convention in Hot Springs, Ark., the
Assemblies of God moved its headquarters to Springfield, Mo., from
St. Louis in 1918. It employs more than 1,300 people in
Springfield: at the headquarters, its seminary, three colleges and
a retirement center.
   _ The Assemblies of God is pentecostal, a branch of Christianity
emphasizing personal experience of God, manifested in ``gifts of
the spirit'' such as speaking in tongues and healing.
   _ It is the largest pentecostal demonination if the United
States, claiming nearly 2.5 million adherents, plus 14 million
overseas _ 9 million of them in Brazil.
   _ There are nearly 11,000 Assemblies of God churches in the
United States and more than 30,000 ministers _ about 3,700 of them
women, according to a 1987 survey.
   _ The church is composed of 57 districts, primarily broken down
by geographic boundaries.
   _ Ordained ministers and church delegates form the General
Council, a body which meets biennially to conduct church business,
formulate procedures and policies, and elect top executive officers
to the 13-member Executive Presbytery. The general superintendent,
who is the top executive officer, is elected to a four-year term;
all others are elected to two-year terms.
   _ Ministers can be disciplined not only for moral indescretion
but also for straying from church doctrines, inefficency, being
contentious or non-cooperative, or trying to assume dictatorial
power over a congregation.

<DATELINE>PUSHKAR, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This town of cobblestone streets and
sparkling white houses is a long way from anywhere in India, but
millions cross a desert every year to get to it and wash away their
sins in its holy lake.
   Pushkar is a place revered by Hindus and even by some foreigners
who seek out its tranquility.
   Its beginnings lie with Lord Brahma, the creator of the universe
in Hindu mythology. Hindu texts have it that when Brahma was
seeking a place for a holy ceremony, he chose Pushkar.
   He dropped a lotus from his hand and water spouted from the
desert to form a lake, according to the texts that date from the
8th century B.C.
   In these modern times, as the sun rises, Hindu pilgrims chant
mantras and take a dip in Pushkar Lake, believing all their sins
will be washed away by the holy waters.
   Europeans and Americans often are seen by the lake, sharing the
religious experience. They feed grain to pigeons and sweets to
long-tailed monkeys who scramble across the pinnacles of the town's
400 temples where ascetics, Hindu monks and other holy men gather.
   Pushkar, a town of 9,000 people, is an oasis of tranquility, far
removed from the bustling cities and teeming slums of Bombay, New
Delhi and Calcutta.
   The blazing sun soaks into everything.
   It was the sacred month of Kartik, signifying the onset of
winter, when Lord Brahma is said to have dropped his lotus blossom.
   Brahma, foremost in the Hindu trinity of supreme gods, had been
looking for a suitable site to perform a major religious ceremony.
   But his wife, Savitri, could not attend the ritual. Angered, she
decreed that henceforth Brahma would be worshiped at only one place.
   Pushkar became the sole earthly home of the peaceful god of
creation, while millions of shrines were erected across India to
Lord Shiva the destroyer and to ferocious goddesses like Kali and
Durga who are often depicted as fire-spitting images carrying heads
of evil men they had slain in battle.
   But this oasis in the desert emerged as a major holy town for
the Hindus, almost equal in importance to Benaras, the ``eternal
city.'' Hindus believe that one goes to heaven if one dies in
Benaras.
   Pilgrims come by the thousands to Pushkar, 250 miles southwest
of New Delhi, to bathe in the lake and revive the memory of
Brahma's majestic rite every year on Kartik Poornima, the full moon
night in the month of November.
   Shielded by Nag Pahar, or Serpent Mountain, Pushkar has India's
_ and perhaps the world's _ only temple to Brahma.
   The town centers on the lake, where there are several steps for
bathing. Signs warn foreigners ``not to wear shorts and other
revealing clothes, not to smoke, drink near the lake or take
photographs, not to kiss, embrace or indulge in other irreverent
acts.''
   The steps, called ghats, are controlled by vigilant and
aggressive brahmin priests, who preside over religious ceremonies,
armed with horoscopes. They watch every pilgrim approaching the
lake and pounce on potential clients.
   Each visit is recorded in their bulky, cloth-covered books. A
priest can easily tell a devotee when his grandfather visited
Pushkar by referring to the dog-eared notebooks.
   Displeasing a priest can be unpleasant. He will pronounce curses
on one's entire family, naming all _ the grandfather, father and
sons.
   From the lake, the steps lead up to the main street, a favorite
shopping center with the tourists. The shops are stacked with
exotic handicrafts, peasant skirts and other clothes native to this
part of India. Velvet shirts and pajamas, musts for low-budget
travelers, hang in vibrant displays.

<HEAD>Political Newcomer Is Fourth Cyprus President Since Independence</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Cyprus-Election</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Vassiliou, elected as Cyprus'
fourth president since independence from Britain 28 years ago, had
never belonged to a political party or been involved in political
activity until he decided to run for office.
   The 56-year-old millionaire businessmen ran as an independent
backed by the Moscow-oriented Communist Party, AKEL, which controls
about one-third of the votes among the 363,000 voters on the Greek
Cypriot side of the divided Mediterranean island.
   On Sunday, he defeated a veteran conservative politician to
become the nation's leader.
   Until his campaign, Vassiliou concentrated on his research and
marketing company, worth about $5 million. It is the largest in the
Middle East.
   The campaign was a first for the communists as well. Until this
poll, the party had always supported centrist candidates, never
fielding its own man.
   But the millionaire's endorsement by the communists was not as
contradictory as it sounds. His parents, Vassos, an eye doctor, and
Phofo, a dentist, were founding members of the party in 1941.
   His father took the family to Greece in 1945 to fight on the
communist side in the civil war.
   The pro-European Vassiliou has stressed his political
independence from the communists, particularly on foreign policy,
and is expected to adhere to Cyprus' non-aligned status.
   The election of the urbane Vassiliou, an economist who speaks
seven languages, breaks the Greek Cypriot nationalists' grip on
power since independence.
   The island's first president, Archbishop Makarios, hero of the
independence struggle in the 1950s, was elected for three five-year
terms with huge majorities.
   His successor, Spyros Kyprianou, was considered his political
heir and served for two terms _ but only with AKEL support, which
was withdrawn in 1985.
   Vassiliou's election breaks the mold. He has said his first
priority is to break the deadlock between Greek and Turkish
Cypriots and seek to reunite the island.
   It has been divided since the Turkish army invaded in 1974,
after a short-lived coup by militant supporters of union with
Greece that installed Nicos Sampson as president for eight days.
   All efforts to find a political settlement have foundered. But
Vassiliou has said he will form a national unity government and is
willing to reopen negotiations without preconditions.
   Vassilou, who was born in Famagusta, now part of the breakaway
Turkish Cypriot republic in the northern third of the island, was
educated in London and Budapest, Hungary. He is married with three
children.

<HEAD>A Year After His Death, Warhol's Legacy Mirrors his Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pop artist Andy Warhol, who gained fame by
calling fame fleeting, has proved otherwise by his death.
   A year after his fatal heart attack in a New York hospital,
Warhol's legacy is a mirror of his life: a melange of high art, low
kitsch, dramatic tension and, as much as ever, the gaze of a
fascinated public.
   ``It's going to take a while still for his legacy to be sorted
out,'' said David Bourdon, an art critic and Warhol biographer.
``But if anybody thought he was going to be a flash in the pan,
they are quite mistaken.''
   Artistically, scrutiny of Warhol's work has risen to a level it
probably never attained in his life. Major film and painting
retrospectives are in the works, as are several biographies and the
publication of his private journal.
   Socially, the cultish lifestyle in which Warhol enveloped
himself will be unwrapped this spring at a huge auction of the
artist's possessions, from Old Master paintings to a Superman
touch-tone phone.
   Commercially, the managers of Warhol's estate have signed a
licensing agreement that principals say could create a
billion-dollar business in retail goods, from calendars to towels,
bearing Warhol images.
   And legally, in its least expected ramification, Warhol's death
continues to reverberate in the medical world. The state has
accused New York Hospital of rendering him deficient care, and his
estate has sued over his death.
   ``What would he think of all this? As far as the brouhaha is
concerned, it's consistent with the way he lived _ action, tension,
all those kinds of things,'' said Edward Hayes, lawyer for the
estate. ``But in terms of his death? He'd probably just think his
death was stupid.''
   Warhol, 58, died in his hospital bed early Feb. 22, 1987, the
day after a surgeon removed his gall bladder. Pathologically
fearful of hospitals and distrustful of doctors, he had put off the
surgery for years.
   His death remains an enigma. The city coroner was unable to say
what caused Warhol's heart to stop, and the state Health
Department, while citing deficient care, did not say the problems _
such as inadequate supervision of nurses and incomplete
record-keeping _ harmed him.
   ``There are cases when cardiac arrest is unexplained. This will
probably be one of those cases,'' said Diana Goldin, spokeswoman
for the hospital, which maintains that Warhol was well cared for.
   In some ways, the inconclusiveness of Warhol's death is fitting.
His life was equally enigmatic, a mix of nightclubbing and
reticence, public persona and intense privacy, counterculture
innovation and determined marketing.
   The everyday object was his icon, the provocative phrase his
byword. ``In the future,'' said Warhol's famous assertion in a 1968
exhibition catalog, ``everyone will be world-famous for 15
minutes.''
   ``He was an incredible character,'' said Bourdon. ``There are
just so many conflicting stories and irreconcilable anecdotes; I
don't think it can ever be sorted out. I think he's just going to
evaporate into legend. He wanted it that way. Facts were always a
little unglamorous to him.''
   But in the absence of Warhol's own brand of glamor _ his
ethereal, black-draped, white-wigged presence _ what remains is the
reality of his art.
   ``You take a look at the work and the personality becomes less
of an issue,'' said Barbara Haskell, curator of the Whitney Museum
of American Art. ``The social presence that he projected is no
longer part of the evaluation, and one can look at the work more
clearly.''
   That appraisal is going on intensively, as often happens after
the death of an artist. The Whitney plans a spring retrospective of
Warhol films. The Museum of Modern Art is preparing for a major
show of Warhol art next year; it will tour worldwide. At least four
books on his life are due out soon.
   ``He tried to cultivate a two-dimensional persona. Now, when one
begins to see the depth of who he was, it becomes more
intriguing,'' said Haskell. ``He is far more significant than he
allowed his public to believe.''
   There are some signs already of the increased value of Warhol's
work. At auction in October, a Warhol painting that was expected to
sell for $70,000 went for $220,000; another with an estimate of
$50,000 sold for $176,000.
   Those sums pale in comparison to the potential value of an
agreement between Warhol's estate and Schlaifer Nance & Co., the
marketing firm behind the Cabbage Patch Kids dolls. Warhol, who
often blurred the line between fine and commercial art, had started
the discussions with Schlaifer two years ago.
   The company may put his name and images on bedding, cosmetics,
paper goods, jewelry _ a huge range of retail items whose sales it
has said could reach the billion-dollar level. Warhol may have
approved; ``Being good in business,'' he wrote in 1975, ``is the
most fascinating kind of art.''
   But for all the marketing schemes and planned art shows,
Warhol's legacy may make its brashest statement in April and May,
when Sotheby's auction house sells the entire, eclectic assortment
of artworks and knickknacks that cluttered his Manhattan townhouse.
Proceeds will fund a foundation for the visual arts.
   The sale is classic Warhol: The six-volume catalog, selling for
$95, is Sotheby's costliest ever, and the first to be sold in
advance in bookstores nationwide. The pieces include 134 pottery
cookie jars, a Rolls Royce, a few important modern art works.
Sotheby's forecasts a $10 million to $15 million sale; other
estimates are more than twice that. The crowd of bidders is sure to
glitter.
   The artist, his friends say, would have loved the fuss _ but in
his own, unrevealing way.
   ``There's been a much heightened interest, naturally,'' said
Fred Hughes, his longtime manager and now executor of his estate.
``Warhol was a hard guy to figure out his reaction. But I think he
would have taken it in his stride.''

   Rescue workers recovered eight
victims and rescued 13 people late Sunday beneath a massive
mudslide in Rio de Janeiro, which has been hit by three days of
pounding rains.
   At least 74 people died and 11,000 were left homeless by the
violent storms since Friday, which turned streets into raging
torrents, threw cars like toys and carried ramshackle homes roaring
down hillsides, civil defense officials said early Monday.
   Authorities estimated 50,000 people eventually may have to be
relocated. Throughout the city, army trucks and volunteers helped
transport slum dwellers from precarious hillside homes to temporary
shelters in schools, churches and public buildings.
   In some cases, people refused to leave their partially destroyed
homes, preferring to ris being crushed beneath their homes than
leave their worldly possession
   Health officials promised mass vaccinations against tetanus and
typhoid and warned residents against an outbreak of leprosy, which
followed a similar spate of rainstorms earlier this month.
   ``From above, one has the impression a giant stepped through the
city, smashing homes and hillsides,'' said Mayor Saturnino Braga,
who called the three-day onslaught the city's worst disaster.
   Civil defense officials estimated Saturday that as many as 150
people were killed in the rains that began late Friday, but the
figure on Sunday lowered to 48 and later raised back to 74.
   Twenty more people were believed missing beneath mud and debris,
including at least eight more people at the Santa Genoveva
hospital. Rescuers recovered the eight bodies and 13 people alive
from the nursing home in the upscale hillside neighborhood of Santa
Teresa, where a three-story wing of the hospital was crushed by a
mudslide Saturday.
   ``It's hard to have an accurate view of the number of dead,''
said civil defense spokesman Bruno Avila. ``We have no idea how
many people have been burried by their shanty town homes nor do we
know exactly how many were in the Santa Genoveva hospital at the
time it was stuck, though we imagine some 30 of the 350 patients
died.''
   Torrents raged down streets throughout the city, prompting some
people to tie their cars to posts to prevent them from being swept
away. Civil defense workers used amphibious vehicle and surfboards
to pluck people from partially submerged cars.
   Rivers and drainage canals overflowed, pushing dozens of shanty
homes from their precarious hillside perches.
   Much of the damage was inflicted on the slums that hold about 2
million of the city's 7 million residents, but wealthy areas also
suffered heavy damage.
   In the Santa Teresa district, an eight-floor apartment building
was evacuated and threatened to topple, engineers said. Evacuations
were ordered after flooding hit the wealthy Gavea, Lagoa and Jardim
Botanico districts.
   Vice Mayor Jo Rezende said he has asked the federal government
for $4 million to clean up city streets, relocate slum dwellers and
repair embankments and streets washed away by the waters.
   ``I can't even imagine what will happen to this city if the
rains continue,'' Rezende told the Jornal do Brasil radio. ``The
situation is desperate. We estimate 50,000 people will have to be
given new housing in safer areas.''
   Public schools were used as shelter for the estimated 10,000
homeless, Avila said. Supermarkets were asked to donate food and
doctors were asked to report for duty.
   Globo, the country's biggest private television network, carried
news flashes every 15 minutes to solicit donations of time, food
and medication.
   Meteorologists said the downpour was caused by an Antarctic cold
front that likely was to continue through Monday.
   Health Secretary Jose Noronha told Rio residents to boil their
drinking water and said the government would carry out vaccinations
against typhoid and tetanus. He said 69 people had been
hospitalized since the beginning of the month with leprosy, a
disease carried by rats and contaminated water.
   Five have died of the disease, Noronha said on Jornal do Brasil
radio.
   Earlier this month, 207 people died in flooding and mudslides
around the state and 13,000 were left homless. The worst-hit area
was Petropolis, a mountain resort town 40 miles north of Rio.

   An Australian navy ship rescued
12 crewmen from a South Korean trawler that sank off New Zealand,
but gave up the search today for three missing crew members.
   The trawler, the Dong Chang No. 3, sank Sunday about 60 miles
north of Wellington near the Western entrance of Cook Strait.
   The Jarvis, a Royal Australian Navy training and support ship,
rescued the 12 crewmen from a life raft, then searched for 17 hours
in heavy seas for three crewmen who disappeared without life
jackets.
   Maj. Peter Fry, spokesman for New Zealand's Defense Department,
said the missing crewmen's chances for survival ``were assessed as
nil after 17 hours in the water.'' There was no immediate word on
what caused the trawler to sink.

   Investigators in motorboats raked the
bottom of a shallow pond at Raleigh-Durham Airport on Sunday,
pulling up debris that may be a clue to a commuter plane crash that
killed 12 people.
   No one survived Friday night's crash of American Eagle Flight
3378, which went down shortly after takeoff en route to Richmond,
Va.
   Because of debris found in the water, investigators believe the
twin-engine turboprop hit the pond before plunging into a wooded
area and exploding, officials said Sunday evening. Earlier, they
had said the plane had barely skimmed the pond, a flood reservoir,
before crashing.
   Parts of the plane, including a portion of the hydraulic system,
were found within 40 feet of the bank, said National Transportation
Safety Board member James L. Kolstad.
   He also said that investigators believe the 28-year-old first
officer, Kathy Digan, was flying the plane when it crashed Friday,
because the captain, Walter Cole, was talking to the control tower
when the plane took off.
   ``The person that does the flying doesn't usually do the
radio,'' Kolstad said.
   Ms. Digan, who was hired by American Eagle last May, had 2,150
total flying hours and 450 in the Metro-III, the craft type
involved in the crash.
   ``She was qualified,'' Kolstad said. ``There is no doubt about
that.''
   Weather at the time of the accident, although poor, was not so
severe as to endanger the flight. Visibility on the runway was
between 2,400 and 3,000 feet when the crash occurred. The flight
could have taken off down to 1,600 feet, Kolstad said.
   Earlier, NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz, said officials hoped
that the search of the reservoir would show ``how (the plane) broke
up. It helps determine the sequence of events.''
   About 25 investigators, including some from the NTSB, sifted
through the roped-off wreckage site on the pond's bank, peering at
small bits of debris and examining larger plane parts for signs of
malfunction.
   Beyond them, men in lifejackets piloted two motorboats around
the surface of the pond, using poles and hooks to retrieve small
pieces of crash debris. The pond measured about 4 feet deep and 75
yards wide, officials said.
   The debris will be used to determine the state and angle of the
plane when it struck the bank, since the aircraft carried no flight
data or cockpit voice recorders, Lopatkiewicz said. Neither is
currently required by the Federal Aviation Administration on
commuter aircraft, although they will be as of March 1989, he said.
   ``If it was flying upside-down, that tells you something,'' he
said.
   Some trees were broken and others were skinned as much as 200
yards beyond the water when the aircraft hit the wooded bank. The
wreckage, including the entire silver tail, was strewn over an area
measuring about 50 feet by 150 feet, Lopatkiewicz said.
   Rubble and bits of shiny metal still littered the tall grass.
The largest plane piece, a red-, white- and blue-striped shard from
the fuselage measuring about 15 feet, lay amid several broken pine
tree trunks. Wheels from the landing gear had broken off their
axle, while about 30 yards away, a piece of the aircraft's
emergency door lay twisted in the mud.
   The remains of the 10 passengers and two crew members were
removed Saturday night from the crash site and taken to the North
Carolina medical examiner's laboratory in Chapel Hill, said Teresa
Damiano, an airport spokeswoman.
   Officials were using fingerprints to help identify the victims,
she said.

   A Japanese cargo ship capsized today after
colliding with a Soviet freighter in Osaka Bay. All five crewmen on
the cargo ship were rescued and no one aboard the Soviet vessel was
injured, a maritime official said.
   Two tug boats sent from Osaka rescued the five crew members from
the 499-ton Ryusei-maru after it collided with the 10,152-ton
Alisher-Navoi, said Mariko Sugai, spokeswoman of the local Maritime
Safety Agency.
   There were no reports of injuries among the 32 crew members
aboard the Alisher-Navoi, she said.
   Two Japanese crewmen, including skipper Takemitsu Masu, were
taken to a hospital in Osaka for treatment of unspecified injuries.
   At the time of the accident, the Soviet vessel was making a turn
in order to leave for Australia after unloading pig iron at an
Osaka pier, while the Ryusei-maru, carrying a load of limestone,
was heading toward the pier.

<DATELINE>LaVALE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For more than 20 years, the lights of this
western Maryland community have shimmered with national pride.
   As the lights of LaVale flicker at dusk, a near-perfect outline
of the United States begins to shine brightly from this residential
community nestled in the foothills of the Alleghenies.
   ``It's an unusual happenstance. No one tried to make it,'' said
Carson Dowell, who has lived for 25 years atop Haystack Mountain
where the map is best viewed on a cold, clear winter night. ``I'm
not sure who discovered it. My wife mentioned it to me. She
couldn't believe it.''
   A shopping center forms the U.S.-Canadian border. A well-lighted
thoroughfare around LaVale is the West Coast. The East Coast is
about a mile of motels, fast food restaurants and stores along U.S.
40.
   ``It's beginning to get a litle busy and distorted because of
all the development in the LaVale area,'' said Cindy Snyder, who
also lives in the 124-home Sunset View development on the mountain.
``As you come down the East Coast, Florida is starting to get a
little out of proportion.''
   ``Back five, 10 years ago, it was probably a little better,''
she said. ``We're not knocking the development, but we're losing
our United States.''
   Maine is formed where U.S. 48 disappears behind a mountain
ridge. The southern edge of Lake Ontario is a bowling alley. A
disfigured Florida appears where U.S. 40 vanishes around Haystack
Mountain. And the Gulf Coast is a grouping of homes and other
establishments.
   ``It's the United States of America from Sunset View,'' said
David Dorsey, a planner with the Allegany County Planning and
Zoning Commission. ``I guess just about everyone has heard of it. I
don't know if everyone believes it.''
   The residential community of more than 7,200 has experienced a
rush of commercial and residential development, especially since
the 1960s, Dorsey said.
   ``We were worried about the mall when it opened up (in 1981),
but it's actually a big Hawaii,'' said Gary Ruddell, a businessman
who lives in the area. ``There's no Alaska. We have to do some more
development.''
   Ruddell, past chairman of the Sunset View Civic Association,
said the map is best seen in the winter when leaves have fallen
from trees on Haystack Mountain. About nine months ago, members of
the association thought about topping some trees to provide a
better view, but scrapped the idea in favor of more pressing needs,
he said.
   Some residents expressed concern that publicity would attract
sightseers to Sunset View and create traffic, but others said most
local residents either have already seen it, or have no interest in
getting a glimpse of America in lights.
   ``Sometimes at night people stop out in front and you wonder
what they're doing,'' Dowell said. ``But then you know what they're
doing. They're looking at the map.''
   ``I remember one time _ it's been years ago _ one of my
neighbors called and said, `There's someone down in your garden
with a tripod surveying,''' Dowell said. ``They weren't surveying.
They were down there taking pictures of the map.''

<HEAD>Half Of Crisis Hotline Staff Walks Out in Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 30 years of handling people in crisis,
the Suicide Prevention Center has a crisis of its own. Half the
telephone hotline workers have walked out in a dispute over layoffs
and control of the center.
   The workers went out on Jan. 1 and it has been a sometimes noisy
dispute, with striking counselors picketing the center's offices
and chanting ``down with the board'' during a recent closed-door
meeting of directors.
   Despite the walkout, the crisis line handled more calls in
January than it did the same month a year earlier, Executive
Director Sheila Halfon said.
   In fact, the strike has prompted people to come forward to ask
if the center needed their help.
   ``We were deluged with calls from people who read about it and
(asked) how could they volunteer,'' Halfon said.
   In addition to the crisis line, the center operates a substance
abuse clinic, a halfway house, an AIDS research project, an art
therapy program and an annual curriculum for schools on substance
abuse and suicide.
   Before the layoffs, the center _ excluding crisis line workers _
had about 90 full- and part-time employees. The crisis line was
staffed by about 80 volunteers and consultants. The latter are
workers who started out as volunteers but have begun to receive
part-time, $6-an-hour shifts.
   The crisis line workers walked out when 27 of the non-crisis
line staffers were laid off and the hours of 15 others were cut
back late last year.
   The layoff was strictly a ``budgetary concern,'' Halfon
asserted, though she admitted, ``the timing was terrible, you know,
December.''
   The center's budget in 1985-86 was about $3 million, including
revenue from contracts, grants, clinic fees and donations, she said.
   But in the last year, some grants have ended and contracts that
provided government funding have not been renewed, she said,
estimating the current budget at about $1.5 million.
   ``We are concerned with fulfilling that,'' she said. ``The
cutbacks in just the layoffs will result in a savings of half a
million dollars.''
   The strikers, however, are particularly upset that among those
laid off was the center's first employee, social worker Sam Heilig,
who served as a clinical consultant.
   ``We can't function without a clinical person in control,''
Phyllis Meisler, a spokeswoman for the strikers, said recently.
   ``The dismissal of one of the most well known and most
experienced persons in the area of suicide prevention doesn't make
much sense,'' said Norman L. Farberow, a psychologist who
co-founded the center in 1958.
   Heilig did not return a telephone call for comment.
   In 1984, Farberow and the other founder, Dr. Robert E. Litman,
turned the center over to a board of directors composed of local
business people so that they could focus on research.
   But the founders, who have remained as clinicians, want to
regain control of the center.
   The board of directors met Feb. 7 to deal with the center's
problems.
   Halfon said the directors favored putting a member of the crisis
line staff on the board, but she would not reveal what moves the
board would take to resolve the overall problem of ``ultimate
administrative control'' of the organization.
   ``That's the part that's in question. What's the best way to
preserve the integrity and assets of the organization?''

   Five months after the FBI fired him, former
agent John C. Ryan is grappling with a religious renewal that
caused him to question his past, challenge his supervisors and lose
his job.
   Wholesale changes are taking place in the life of a man who was
10 months away from settling into a quiet retirement when he was
dismissed Sept. 11.
   After carrying a gun every day during 21 years of loyal FBI
service, Ryan now is a pacifist who denounces the ``immoral
activities'' of the FBI and the United States' involvement in
Central America.
   Ryan, 49, is selling his Peoria home, where he and his wife,
Peggy, raised four children. And he's pondering a total change in
lifestyle while searching for a way to support his family the next
12 years until he can collect his federal pension.
   ``It would be inconsistent for me to continue being a heavy
consumer knowing how many victims the American lifestyle demands,''
Ryan said recently. ``There's war in Latin America so we can
continue to eat Big Macs, and I don't want to contribute to that.
We're scaling down our lifestyle to a more simplified life.''
   His only income comes from speaking engagements and from
teaching a sociology class at Bradley University. Legal fees to
fight his dismissal have eaten $13,000 out of the family savings _
perhaps part of the reason for the change in lifestyle.
   Clad in sneakers and jeans, Ryan hardly resembled the man who
spent two decades in foreign counterintelligence, investigating
organized crime in New York and hunting fugitives like anti-war
activist Daniel Berrigan.
   His work twice won him commendations, but something was missing
from his life. A devout Roman Catholic who once studied for the
priesthood, Ryan started taking religious study courses about 10
years ago.
   He earned his master's degree in 1985, and the transformation
from a follower of J. Edgar Hoover into a pacifist began to mature.
   It was then that Ryan knew his beliefs would conflict with his
role as chief counterintelligence operative in the FBI's five-man
office here. But he never really thought it would lead to his
dismissal.
   ``Refusing an order was something I'd never done before, and I
knew an act of insubordination would cost me some sort of
disciplinary action,'' Ryan said. ``I have religious beliefs they
are bound to accommodate. There are office jobs, places I could
work in the FBI. I wouldn't have to carry a gun.
   ``I think they overreacted in firing me. It was stupid. Look at
all the notoriety it has caused.''
   Ryan's life is in turmoil, but he seems content with his
decision to refuse an order to investigate an anti-nuclear group
suspected of vandalizing 11 Chicago-area military recruiting
offices.
   ``I really feel I did the right thing,'' Ryan said. ``I don't
know if I could have lived with myself had I done anything
differently.''
   His firing occurred 10 months before his 50th birthday in June,
when he would have been eligible for full retirement with 20 years
service.
   ``I could have simply ignored the order, but I chose not to. I
felt what we were doing was clearly investigating peace groups with
the obvious intention of intimidating and harassing them. I thought
the FBI was ill-advised to do this and I told them.''
   Despite his change of heart, the FBI negotiated with Ryan and
offered to reinstate him, with back pay, in December on the
condition he never speak of the case again. He said he signed an
agreement and mailed it to FBI headquarters but for some reason the
deal collapsed. The FBI has refused to say why.
   This month, an administrative judge in St. Louis ruled the FBI
was justified in firing Ryan.
   At a hearing, Ryan said he could not take a human life, even if
his or another person's life was endangered. He believes that was a
key reason his dismissal was upheld.
   Ryan still hopes to reclaim his job and his pension, and an
appeal is planned.

<HEAD>Suspect's Mother Wants To Send Sympathy Cards To Victims' Families</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mother of a man accused of bursting
into a defense company and shooting seven people to death said
she's saddened by the ``waste of life'' and wants to send sympathy
cards to the victims' families.
   ``I wish those people would know how badly we feel,'' Mina Belle
Farley said in an interview published Sunday. ``I don't know if it
would help (to send cards), but we could tell them how sad we are
about all of this.''
   Mrs. Farley, 70, also said she was shocked to learn that her
son, Richard Wade Farley, was charged with seven counts of murder
in Tuesday's shootings at ESL Inc. offices in nearby Sunnyvale.
   ``We'd never had any problems with Rick,'' she told the San Jose
Mercury News in a telephone interview Saturday from her home in
Henderson, Texas, about 100 miles east of Dallas.
   Mrs. Farley and her husband, Thomas, who is retired from a
career in the Air Force, learned of the shootings and their oldest
child's arrest the next day after they tried to contact him in San
Jose.
   Neither Farley's parents nor any of his five brothers and
sisters have heard from him since the attack, she said.
   ``We don't communicate much,'' said Mrs. Farley, who hasn't seen
her son since a trip to California 1{ years ago.
   She also said her son never mentioned 26-year-old Laura Black,
an ESL employee who authorities describe as the unwilling object of
Farley's romantic fantasies.
   Farley's four-year obsession with the electrical engineer is
believed by authorities to be the reason for the rampage. He was
fired in May 1986 for harassing Black, who went to court for a
restraining order to stop him from following, calling and writing
her, authorities said.
   Black was one of the three people who were shot during the
rampage, but she survived. She remained in stable condition at
Stanford University Medical Center, where she is expected to remain
for several more days.
   Farley remained under 24-hour surveillance at the Santa Clara
County Jail. Sheriff's Lt. Mike Fine said he was quiet and polite.
   Besides the seven murder counts, Farley is charged with three
counts of attempted murder. He could face execution if convicted.

   A fire roared through a crowded house early
Sunday, killing two children and three mentally retarded adults and
injuring four other people, authorities said.
   The fire apparently started near a wood stove and the rural,
two-story house was in flames by the time firefighters arrived,
Charlotte County investigator W.H. Gholson said.
   Phenix firefighters were aided by neighboring departments from
Redhouse and Brookneal, but the blaze destroyed the house.
   There were 11 people in the house at the time the fire broke
out, officials said. Jackie Hamlett, one of the two who escaped
unhurt, identified the victims as Helen Schofield, 49; Dennis
Jones, 21; Ruth Berger, 64; Amir Hall, 3; and Rashanda Carrington,
18 months.
   ``We tried to get the people out of there for 20 or 30
minutes,'' said Chief Walter Bailey of the Phenix Volunteer Fire
Department. ``Then the fire and the heat got to be too much, and I
had to pull everybody back.''
   Beatrice Vaughan, 84, was listed in critical condition Sunday
night at Lynchburg General Hospital with burn injuries. Three other
occupants were treated and released, Gholson said.
   The home was owned by Helen Barrett, who was among those who
escaped with minor injuries, Gholson said.
   Ms. Barrett said the three adults were mentally retarded wards
of the state and she was paid by Charlotte County Social Services
to take care of them. She said they had lived in her home for as
much as 16 years and were relatively self-sufficient.
   Leddie Fuller, director of county social services, could not be
reached for comment early Monday; telephone calls to her home went
unanswered.
   Bailey said the fire apparently started after Ms. Barrett added
wood to the stove and returned to bed.
   ``We don't know if it was a defective flue or if there was
combustible material near the stove right now. We think it probably
came from a spark that flew out.''
   Ms. Vaughan discovered the fire when she went downstairs to warm
up, Bailey said.
   ``She got burned by the fire, and that's when Barrett and
(resident) Cathryn Hamlett came in and tried to put it out with a
fire extinguisher. Then they started with buckets of water, but
they couldn't do anything to it.''
   Ms. Barrett and Cathryn Hamlett went to a neighbor's house,
where they called the fire department. They were both treated and
released.
   Officials said Cathryn Hamlett was Ms. Barrett's daughter, and
some of the other people in the house were related, but they
weren't sure of their exact relationship. They said the only
retarded adults who were wards of the state were apparently the
three adults who died.
   Four bodies were recovered, but the body of the younger child,
who had been sleeping on the second floor, had not been found,
Bailey said.

<HEAD>Big-Money Lobbying On Panama's Behalf Was Rule Until Recently</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama has spent hundreds of thousands of
dollars since 1985 hiring American lobbyists to champion the
country's cause in Congress and improve its image in the United
States, records show.
   Among those who have registered as agents of Panama are Stuart
Spencer, a long-time political adviser to President Reagan; M.B.
Oglesby Jr., former White House assistant for legislative affairs;
Francis Gomez, an executive with ties to Lt. Col. Oliver North's
network, and Jamie Whitten Jr., the son of Rep. Jamie Whitten,
D-Miss.
   The documents are filed at the Justice Department in compliance
with the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The law requires foreign
agents to report their activities every six months.
   Many foreign governments hire lobbyists to help learn about the
complicated U.S. bureaucracy. In recent years, the practice has
attracted congressional scrutiny, particularly when former
government officials sell their inside knowledge to foreigners.
   Raul St. Malo, a spokesman at Panama's embassy, said the
government no longer employs any American lobbyists, and the
records indicate that many contracts have lapsed.
   Relations between the two countries have deteriorated sharply
since Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the country's dominant figure,
was indicted on drug smuggling charges in Miami this month.
   One of the most recent filings _ covering the period through
December 1987 _ was made by Gomez, a former State Department
official and one-time business partner of Richard R. Miller, an
associate of North's.
   Gomez's company, Public Affairs Resources Inc., was paid nearly
$145,000 between July and December 1987 by a Panamanian business
group set up in August 1986 to ``promote tourism, exports,
investment and an improved image'' for Panama.
   The group, Impulso Turistico y Financiera de Panama, is headed
by Robert Cordovez. Gomez said Cordovez is a businessman with
``ties to people in the government.''
   Panamanian opposition figures, including Roberto Eisenmann, the
editor of the newspaper La Prensa, said Cordovez is close to
Noriega. Eisenmann lives in exile in Miami.
   For his money, Gomez worked extensively with the Panamanian
Embassy, the documents show. Among his duties: ``Edited articles
written by embassy officials,'' and, ``Made copies of newspaper
articles, speeches and letters as requested by the embassy.''
   The $21,000 a month contract with Impulso was first signed in
September 1986 by International Business Communications, a
now-defunct firm run by Miller and Gomez.
   Miller, who worked with North raising money for the Nicaraguan
Contras in 1985 and 1986, has pleaded guilty to tax violations in
soliciting contributions for the rebels. There is no indication
that Gomez worked with North.
   North, an ex-National Security Council aide, was fired in
November 1986 for his role in using money secured through the sale
of arms to Iran to help the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Gomez said his relationship with the Panamanian group has ended,
and he no longer works with Miller.
   Some major firms, such as Bill Hecht and Associates, which
employed Spencer and Oglesby, and Daniel J. Edelman Inc., lost
their contracts with Panama in 1986, a year in which Panama came
under increasing attack from U.S. officials.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz registered concern in June
1986 about allegations that Noriega engaged in drug-trafficking and
gun-running. And Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., called Noriega the
``head of the biggest drug trafficking operation in the Western
Hemisphere.'' U.S. aid to Panama ceased in late 1987.
   The law firm of Lipsen, Hamberger, Whitten and Hamberger, which
did lobbying work for Panama, last worked for the country in late
1985, according to Martin Hamberger.
   Spencer, one of Reagan's close friends, worked for the Hecht
firm, which signed a $25,000-a-month contract with the Panamanian
government in late 1985, shortly after Noriega installed President
Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   The Hecht firm's contract, which expired in November 1986,
called for discussions with members of Congress, their staffs and
the executive branch about the ``political, economic and social
situation'' in Panama.
   Spencer, whose home address is Newport Beach, Calif., flew to
Panama at least twice, staying at the El Panama Hilton or the
Marriott, records show.
   The documents do not explain exactly what Spencer did for
Panama. Spencer did not return two telephone calls, and Hecht said
it is against his policy to discuss relations with clients.
   But Rep. Mike Lowery, D-Wash., recalled a luncheon at the
Capitol Hill Club _ a Republican haunt _ that he went to in January
1986 at the invitation of the Hecht staff.
   The Hecht people wanted to explore arranging better contacts
between Panamanian legislators and members of Congress, he said.
They also discussed U.S. aid to Panama, he said. Washington shut
off all aid to the country in December 1987.
   Bud Moss, an aide to Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., said he couldn't
recall the topic of Panama coming up at a luncheon with Frank West,
a lobbyist from the Hecht firm. ``We talked about banking,'' Moss
said. The $36.10 meal was charged to Panama.
   Steve Cook, a representative of Edelman, said his firm did press
work for Panamanian officials roughly between November 1985 and May
1986. One project involved setting up interviews for Delvalle's
wife at an anti-drug conference in Atlanta, he said.
   Raymond Bender, a lawyer with Dow, Lohnes and Albertson, said he
has represented the Panamanian government on some legal matters.

   A wildfire whipped by winds of up to 50
mph raced through a mountain valley south of here Sunday,
destroying at least three homes and burning hundreds of acres of
grassland, witnesses said.
   No injuries were reported.
   Firefighters from at least 10 volunteer fire departments in the
rural area northwest of Yellowstone National Park battled the
blaze, assisted by volunteers from the Forest Service, the
Department of State Lands and two mining companies.
   Gail Giono, a dispatcher for the Jefferson County Sheriff's
Department, said the fire was first reported in early afternoon and
had grown to 500 acres by early evening. It remained uncontrolled,
and those on the scene reported at least three homes destroyed, she
said.
   The fire was centered about five miles south of this town of
1,000 and was headed eastward, not toward the town, officials said.
The homes that burned were scattered rural residences.
   The wind ``is as bad as I've ever seen it,'' said Glen Hanson, a
trapper who lives on the south edge of town. ``The ... stuff was
going faster than you could run.''
   ``A lot of people lost their homes,'' Hanson said, but noted he
did not know exactly how many homes were destroyed.
   Authorities said it was believed that the fire was caused by a
downed power line, but that had not been confirmed.
   Strong winds raked much of Montana east of the Continental
Divide on Sunday. There were widespread reports of damaged roofs,
downed power lines, uprooted trees and toppled billboards and signs.

<HEAD>Six Meteorites From Moon Found in Antarctica</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 15-year search for meteorites in
Antarctica has turned up thousands of meteorites, including six
from the moon and one possible rock from Mars, scientists say.
   Those seven meteorites _ solid bodies that travel through space
and survive passage through the Earth's atmosphere _ have been the
focus of years of scrutiny by scientists looking for insight on the
composition of the two heavenly bodies.
   ``It has always been assumed that a lot of material should be
falling off the moon from meteoritic impact,'' said Ursula B.
Marvin, a geologist at the Smithsonian Institution's Center for
Astrophysics here. ``We suspected that some of our meteorites came
from the moon before the Apollo missions.''
   Marvin was part of the U.S. expedition that discovered the
plum-sized rock weighing about four grams in January 1982.
   Japanese scientists have located five lunar meteorites in
Antarctica. Scientists also are ``building a case'' for Martian
origin of the meteorite found in 1979.
   Comparing the 1982 find with lunar samples collected by American
astronauts, scientists found the meteorite closely matched highland
materials returned by the Apollo 15, 16 and 17 crews.
   Analysis indicated that the fragment was blasted away from the
moon by an asteroid impact about 100,000 years ago and hurled to
Earth.
   The 66-year-old Marvin, who also teaches part-time at Harvard
University, said the lunar meteorite probably was traveling in
space for between 1,900 and 2,500 years before crashing through the
atmosphere and landing on the Antarctic ice.
   The Antarctic rock believed to be from Mars spent about 10
million years in space.
   Some of the 1,000 moon rocks retrieved in the Apollo missions
have been dated at more than 4 billion years old _ a short time, by
geologic standards.
   X-rays and gamma-rays of the moon's surface taken by Apollo
orbiters have led scientists to believe the lunar meteorite may
come from a crater on the far-eastern rim of the moon or on the
unexplored dark side, Marvin said.
   ``We went to six places on the moon and the Russians sent
unmanned landers to three places,'' she said. ``We have no exact
location for this composition anywhere.''
   Annual U.S. meteorite expeditions to Antarctica occur in the six
weeks of the year when the continent is bathed in sunlight 24 hours
a day.
   The National Science Foundation, the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration and the Smithsonian provide equipment and
financing for research for the meteoritic expeditions, said Marvin,
who has has made three trips to the 5-million-square-mile continent
to search for meteorites.
   She said that since manned moon exploration stopped after the
Apollo 17 mission in 1972, meteorite searches are crucial.
   ``It's one of the most vital and productive aspects of the space
program,'' Marvin said. ``As a matter of fact, in planetary
exploration it's the only show in town. This all gives us more
information _ without actually going up there _ about the evolution
of the moon as a body.''

   A foul-smelling mist came rolling into
Atwater, Calif., on the night air, silently blanketing a row of
homes on the outskirts. Within an hour, townsfolk were staggering
into the emergency room.
   Environmentalists point to the June 1 incident, which they
contend was caused by pesticides sprayed on nearby peach orchards,
to fuel their arguments that the nation must do more to control the
poisons.
   The Senate Agriculture Committee is set to try once again to
overhaul the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act
(FIFRA), the primary law providing for regulation of the compounds.
   Pesticides are now a $5 billion-a-year industry. Tomatoes, beef,
potatoes, apples, pork and many other foods arrive at the dinner
table laden with chemicals. In a number of states, pesticides have
been found in groundwater, often used for drinking.
   Chemical makers contend that the benefits of pesticides outweigh
the risks. They say drinking a glass of well water where
contamination has been measured poses less hazard than downing a
shot of vodka.
   However, there are some 113,000 cases of pesticide-related
illness and injury logged each year. A May 1987 National Academy of
Sciences report said cancer is caused in laboratory animals by 30
percent of the insecticides most likely to show up in food, 50
percent of the herbicides and 90 percent of the fungicides.
   Congress has moved fitfully at best to tighten regulation of the
1 billion pounds of pesticides sprayed on U.S. fields annually in
the war on bacteria, fungi, bugs, worms, mice and other forms of
crop blight.
   Critics ridicule FIFRA as hopelessly toothless. ``We call it a
no-law law because it doesn't do anything,'' consumer advocate
Ralph Nader says.
   A 1972 rewrite of FIFRA gave the Environmental Protection Agency
until 1975 to complete a ``reregistration'' process, including a
full-scale safety review, of some 700 pesticides. In 1975,
lawmakers approved a one-year extension. In 1978, the deadline was
junked altogether.
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
now estimates that at the present crawl, the job won't be completed
until the year 2024.
   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.,
and Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., have proposed a nine-year
deadline for the reregistration process, plus a possible two-year
extension.
   ``I think most Americans are willing to put up with a spot on
their lettuce or a blemish on their apple rather than risk
cancer,'' says Leahy.
   The National Agricultural Chemicals Association, champion of the
nation's pesticide makers, has no objection to a speedup in itself.
   More complex issues, however, are lying in the legislative weeds
and could rise up to scuttle the bill. Something similar happened
in 1986 when a seeming compromise came unglued just before Congress
adjourned.
   Chemical companies are willing to contribute to the costs of
reregistration by paying $150,000 per ingredient. But the
Leahy-Lugar bill calls for $750,000, which the NACA calls ``a money
grab, pure and simple.''
   Under current law, companies are entitled to indemnities from
EPA to compensate for the banning of their products. Already the
agency has paid $2.4 million to chemical makers for taking the
pesticide EDB off the market and $18 million for a chemical known
as 2,4,5-T, or Silex.
   And the agency estimates it will pay out between $60 million and
$155 million in indemnities and disposal costs to get rid of a
pesticide called Dinoseb, The annual budget of the entire EPA
pesticide program is $70 million.
   The Leahy-Lugar bill would bar such indemnities unless Congress
passed an individual money bill for each one. Such a measure is
guaranteed a rough time on Capitol Hill. The industry is firmly
opposed.
   Manufacturers have other objections as well, especially to an
amendment Leahy co-sponsored with Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn.
NACA President Jack D. Early told the Agriculture Committee that
the Leahy-Durenberger amendment contains ``an unrealistic ground
water definition, unenforceable goals for water quality standards
and (an) unworkable state ground and surface water protection
program.''
   Of the main legislation, he said the plan to require separate
money bills for indemnities would ``ultimately be bad for
agriculture'' because ``there is no guarantee that agricultural
users will recoup their losses.''
   However, one incentive to action is a provision that would
extend patent rights for chemical manufacturers.
   The 1986 bill passed by the House also included provisions that
would preempt states from setting more stringent safety standards
than those of the federal government and exempt agricultural
producers from cleanup liability under the environmental laws. They
were rejected by the Senate when it fashioned its own version.
   In the House, the Agriculture and the Energy and Commerce
committees are fighting over jurisdiction of the bill.
   Some FIFRA critics, such as Rick Hind of the U.S. Public
Interest Research Group, declare in disgust that it ``will take a
disaster'' to get the House moving on pesticide legislation. But
House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza,
D-Texas, scoffs at that notion.
   ``We don't need a disaster,'' he says. ``We know what we have to
do.''

   Eleven cars of a 133-car Union Pacific
Railroad freight train derailed and spilled an acid solution into a
creek, threatening the water supply for thousands of people,
authorities said.
   No one was injured in Sunday's derailment in which one car
spilled about 13,000 gallons of phosphatic fertilizer solution
containing phosphoric acid into the creek leading to the Lamine
River, said Walter Fussner, a Union Pacific spokesman.
   The Lamine River, which feeds into the Missouri River, is the
water source for nearby Boonville, a town of nearly 7,000
residents. Officials shut off the water intake valve to the
community as a precaution, and residents were asked to conserve
water, said Lt. Becky Loesing of the Cooper County Emergency
Operations office.
   The Jefferson City water department was monitoring its water
supply from the Missouri River.
   Phosphoric acid can irritate the skin and respiratory system,
said Larry Alderson, environmental emergency specialist with the
Missouri Department of Natural Resources.
   A 50-man cleanup crew worked into the night with backhoes and
bulldozers to clean up and neutralize the acid. Trace elements of
the acid were found in the Lamine River, but no fish were killed,
Fussner said.
   Fussner said the cause of the accident, which occurred shortly
before noon two miles from the Missouri River, was under
investigation.
   Union Pacific officials called a cleanup contractor, who built a
dam to try to prevent the fertilizer from further contaminating the
Lamine River. Lime was hauled in to neutralize the acid, Alderson
said.
   Fussner said the railroad encountered problems because the spill
was in a remote area. No roads lead to the area, and all supplies
were being brought in by train.
   The train was traveling from East St. Louis, Ill., to North
Platte, Neb., when the accident occurred near this central Missouri
town.

<HEAD>Chirac Pulling Ahead In Crucial Race For Second Place</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>REIMS, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Jacques Chirac, long mired in third
place in opinion polls, has seen his presidential campaign take
off, giving him an edge over rival conservative Raymond Barre with
two months left before the vote.
   The first round of the election, April 24, has become in effect
a primary election between Chirac and Barre. Unless there is a
stunning turnaround, one of the two will oppose a Socialist,
probably incumbent President Francois Mitterrand, in the decisive
May 8 runoff for a seven-year term.
   Policy differences between Chirac and Barre are few and minor,
so the campaign has focused on the contrasting personalities of the
two men, and what their political advisers increasingly call ``le
look.''
   There is certainly no need for the voters to discover the
candidates _ Mitterrand has been a major national figure for 40
years, Barre and Chirac for 15 years each.
   ``It's a question of sentiment, who looks better and talks
better,'' said Bertrand Louapre, a Barre supporter interviewed on
the edges of a cocktail reception during a Chirac campaign swing
Wednesday through Reims, capital of the Champagne country northeast
of Paris.
   ``Personally, I've chosen Raymond Barre,'' said Louapre, a
construction engineer. ``Mr. Chirac has certainly taken off faster.
He has much stronger support from his party.''
   Chirac, a rangy, almost hyperactive figure, then displayed his
formidable skills as a campaigner, moving swiftly through the
crowd, but often stopping to grasp the hands of his supporters
briefly in his own oversized hands.
   ``I think the premier is closer to people, and that's what will
make him win,'' political science professor Alain Redslob, author
of a book on Chirac, said in an interview. ``I think there's a
strong movement beginning to lift off.''
   ``The Barre style is that of a fairly cold man, who has wanted
to give himself an image of rigor,'' Bernard Pons, Chirac's
minister of overseas territories, recently said in a radio
interview. ``He is a man who is fairly secret and who ...
frequently makes decisions alone.''
   Barre, a rotund economics professor who had never run for public
office when he began his five-year term as premier in 1976, is
widely respected but inspires little enthusiasm. He prides himself
on telling people what they need to know, whether or not they want
to hear it.
   ``They tell me to offer the French people a dream,'' Barre told
a campaign rally in the southwestern city of Poitiers on Wednesday.
``But to dream, one must first go to sleep. I love my country too
much, I respect my fellow citizens too much to lend myself to
that.''
   Barre says Chirac's government, which took over from the
Socialists in March 1986, has made some good moves. He says he
would take stronger action to boost French industry.
   Mitterrand has long had a solid lead in all published opinion
surveys, while Chirac trailed Barre thoughout last year. A poll
published Jan. 16, the day Chirac declared his candidacy, gave
Mitterrand 41 percent to 25 percent for Barre and 18.5 percent for
Chirac.
   But surveys published in the past two weeks have shown Chirac
pushing ahead. Friday's edition of the magazine Paris-Match, for
exampale, reported 23 percent of those questioned planning to vote
for Chirac, to 19 percent for Barre. Mitterrand, who says he will
wait until mid-March to disclose his plans, remained far ahead with
36 percent.
   The questions were posed for Paris-Match and a radio network by
the polling firm B.V.A., which between Feb. 1-4 interviewed 1,316
people who said they intended to vote. No margin of error was
disclosed.
   Barre, who insists on his independence from all political
parties, is supported by the Union for French Democracy, a loose
grouping of five center-right parties that is part of Chirac's
governing coalition.
   The main event of Chirac's five-hour visit to Reims was a
campaign rally that drew 7,000 supporters to a new exposition hall
in the suburbs. Many arrived in buses chartered by Chirac's party,
the Rally for the Republic, France's most efficient political
machine.
   Rather than give a speech, Chirac answered questions from three
men and two women chosen to raise issues of concern in the region.
   He defended France's agricultural policies and promised to
improve schools and universities so that students learn skills they
need to find jobs. He also said he hoped to increase family
allowances to mothers of three or more children to the minimum
wage, about $825 a month, ``because they deserve it.''
   The first question asked of Chirac, who is juggling duties as
mayor of Paris, premier of France and member of a regional council
in south-central France, was how he can do all the work.
   ``I'm an optimist by nature,'' he replied, ``which probably
gives me more energy to face problems.''

<TEXT>
   Young cancer victims and their parents
gained emotional support and more than $300,000 in financial help
from college students who swayed and staggered through a 48-hour
dance marathon.
   ``I just like the fact that people are dancing not just to dance
for fun but to help kids,'' said 10-year-old Diane Brannon of
Etters, a leukemia patient who took a few turns around the dance
floor with Penn State University students Sunday.
   Billed as the largest student-run fund-raising event in the
country, the 16th annual Interfraternity Dance Marathon raised
$324,200 in pledges for the Four Diamonds Fund at Penn State's
Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, organizers said Sunday.
   Diane's mother, Teresa, said she and her husband, Jim, would
have been forced to sell their house without financial help from
the fund, which helps pay for treatment of children suffering from
cancer.
   Bob Sherfy, a social worker at Hershey Medical Center who works
with the young cancer victims, said the dance marathon offered the
parents and children more than money.
   ``They know there's someone out in the world who cares about
them,'' Sherfy said.
   Near then end of the marathon, participants complained of sore
feet, fatigue and boredom.
   ``It's torture,'' said Marc Baskin, a junior management major
from Glen Cove, N.Y.
   But Baskin and many other dancers said they gained resolve from
the children at the dance.
   ``When they brought the kids in Saturday, you said to yourself,
`You can do it,''' said Tammie Rutherford, a sophomore business
management major from White Plains, N.Y.
   Hundreds of volunteers, clad in yellow T-shirts, attended the
hobbled and weary dancers as they endured the final leg of the
marathon.
   Tom West, a sophomore sports medicine major from West Long
Branch, N.J., taped feet, iced ankles and treated blisters from a
trainer's table off the dance floor.
   ``Some people come in and their feet are just flat,'' said West,
explaining that fallen arches were the most frequent physical
malady.
   Carol Stelmach, a junior marketing major from Baltimore, said
she and other dancers had a tactic for keeping their minds off
their feet.
   ``You have to do something that makes you think of your hands,''
Ms. Stelmach said. She said she had played catch using a frisbee
and balls and even participated in a card game.
   A total of 272 couples _ 544 dancers _ entered the marathon this
year, said Pat Dugan, a senior accounting major from Pittsburgh and
head of the organizing committee. A total of 506 finished.
   They were allowed only three-minute breaks every eight hours and
three other three-minute breaks at some time during the marathon.
   Spectators filled the White Building Gymnasium to capacity for
the final hours of the marathon, clapping and cheering.
   Dugan said this year's marathon was the most financially
successful in the event's history.
   James H. Brucker, director of development for the medical
center, said the marathon is the single biggest source of income
for the Four Diamonds Fund.
   Last year, the dance marathon raised $297,000, Dugan said.

<HEAD>Gephardt Making Stand In South Dakota In Bid For Pre-Super Tuesday
Win</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RAPID CITY, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Richard Gephardt, who has made
``It's your fight too'' his populist rally cry, has chosen this
state as a staging ground for a bid to block Michael Dukakis from
sweeping the handful of states holding presidential primaries or
caucuses before Super Tuesday.
   South Dakota, and to a lesser extent Wyoming, are the states
chosen by the Gephardt campaign for an intensive effort even as the
three-week campaign for the South and its rich pool of delegates
has already begun.
   According to the calendar and the Democratic Party's nomination
rules, South Dakota might not appear a major battleground. Its
primary was set for Tuesday, earlier than national Democratic
officials wanted it, only after agreement was reached that means
the state's nominating delegates won't be selected until later and
won't be bound by the primary outcome.
   But Gephardt has attached far more significance to South Dakota,
boarding a jet to fly here just as the sun was starting to rise
Wednesday morning on his badly needed second-place finish in New
Hampshire.
   ``You have a powerful voice in the election in 1988,'' Gephardt
told a group of senior citizens in Sioux Falls, on the opposite end
of the state.
   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois, his campaign on the ropes after
finishing behind the Missouri congressman in Iowa and New
Hampshire, has chosen Minnesota and South Dakota to make what could
be his last stand.
   He said at one point that if he didn't win in South Dakota, or
in Minnesota's caucuses which also are held Tuesday, he will drop
out of the race, but then backed off on that assertion, citing a
surge of donations.
   Gephardt strategists, however, say it is not Simon but Dukakis
that they regard as their bigger concern in those two states,
coming as he does off a big victory in New Hampshire's primary last
Tuesday.
   That is in part because Gephardt would like to have a primary
victory before heading into the 20-state contests on March 8.
Perhaps more importantly, however, his campaign would like to block
Dukakis from gaining the state and going into the South with one or
even more victories under his belt from outside his native New
England.
   They do not want Dukakis to have the suggestion of inevitibility
riding on his side should Gephardt _ or one of the other candidates
_ fail to stop him.
   There are five states holding primaries or caucuses between now
and the contests across the South on Super Tuesday. They are
sometimes referred to in the jargon of the campaign trail as the
``Lesser Antilles'' or the ``gateway states'' to Super Tuesday.
   ``A boost from any of these five gateway states would give us a
boost to Super Tuesday,'' said Ali Webb, Gephardt's press secretary.
   The contests include Maine's caucuses Feb. 26 and Vermont's
beauty-contest primary March 1. The Gephardt campaign is conceding
the New England states to Dukakis, governor of nearby Massachusetts.
   Gephardt attended a debate in Minnesota last week but isn't
otherwise competing in the state, arguing that its caucus system
and internal party divisions make it too confusing to spend time
competing.
   Gephardt brought close to 20 paid staffers from South Dakota to
Iowa as soon as Iowa's caucuses were finished. They have purchased
$40,000 in television commercials in the states's two major cities,
Rapid City and Sioux Falls _ an amount of money small by other
states' standards but regarded as large in the state of fewer than
three-quarters of a million people.
   Internal polling conducted by the Gephardt campaign Wednesday
night showed Dukakis was leading in the state by a nine-point
margin, with no other candidates close. But it also showed the race
was largely uniformed in the state, less than a week before the
voting.
   Another candidate, Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, has been
quietly at work in South Dakota and Wyoming too, even as he
concentrates on the states of his native South. He has ads on the
air in South Dakota and has visited Wyoming several times.
   Another reason for concentrating here is that Gephardt forces
believe the states should respond nicely to his populist message _
an assertion the nation is in economic decline in part because of
unfair trade practices by Asian countries.
   Gephardt's support for an oil import fee is considered a plus,
particularly in Wyoming, where a large oil industry remains
hard-hit by depressed prices.
   He stressed that at a small rally in Casper, Wyo., last week,
and seemed to strike a chord among the audience.
   Barb Reese, a member of the county Democratic executive
committee, said she saw Gore speak in Wyoming a week or so earlier
but found Gephardt more appealing. She said she was wavering, and
might back Gephart rather than go along with an effort by state
party leaders to back an uncommitted slate.
   ``I was really set on being uncommitted in the caucuses because
I thought it was best for Wyoming,'' she said. But, she said: ``I'm
impressed.''

<TEXT>
   House negotiators are making plans to scuttle
a trade retaliation plan authored by Democratic presidential
hopeful Richard Gephardt, but the Missouri congressman is vowing to
fight for his amendment.
   Conferees plan to strip the provision from a House-passed trade
measure in an effort to save the overall bill, according to
congressional leaders.
   But lawmakers suggest that as a courtesy to Gephardt, the
conferees will wait until after the March 8 Super Tuesday primary
elections before formally abandoning the proposal.
   ``The Gephardt provision will be dropped. We're going to dump it
because it's bad policy,'' said Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., chairman
of the trade subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee and
a member of the House-Senate conference committee hammering out a
compromise trade bill.
   The Gephardt plan calls for trade retaliation against Japan and
other trading partners that maintain large trade surpluses with the
United States. The omnibus trade legislation it is attached to has
languished in Congress since last fall.
   ``Gephardt's a nice fellow and he's got a lot of friends here,''
Gibbons said. ``We're kind of proud of him. But we're not going to
make his amendment law.''
   Gibbons and other House leaders said that once Super Tuesday is
past, the House conferees will move quickly to get rid of the
Gephardt provision _ regardless of how he does in those primary
states.
   Gephardt said he has no intention of dropping his push for the
amendment that bears his name.
   ``I'm going to fight for my amendment,'' he said as he
campaigned in South Dakota on Sunday. ``I think it will make it
through the conference'' committee.
   The Missouri congressman, who has made trade issues a key part
of his presidential pitch, was asked if rejection of the amendment
would hurt his campaign. ``Let's see what the result is before we
jump to conclusions,'' he said.
   Conference leaders have held off on moving ahead on the measure
to await the results of the early presidential contests _ in part
because Gephardt's amendment is such a major part of the House bill.
   President Reagan opposes the imposition of retaliatory trade
measures by Congress, and the White House has said he will veto the
trade bill if it contains Gephardt's amendment.
   Twenty states hold Democratic primary elections on March 8, with
13 in the South where trade is a major issue because of
import-battered textile and other local industries.
   However, with recent signs that the nation's stubborn trade
deficit is finally easing under the pressure of a weaker dollar,
which makes U.S. goods more competitive overseas, political
sentiment has been shifting in Congress away from tough retaliatory
sanctions.
   Last October's stock market plunge, which underscored the
fragility of world financial markets, has also subdued some of the
most vocal calls for protectionist measures on Capitol Hill.
   The Gephardt measure, passed last spring by the House, is aimed
particularly at Japan. It would require mandatory retaliation after
a six-month period if those negotiations prove fruitless. Then, a
10 percent a year reduction in the offending nation's trade surplus
_ through tariffs or quotas _ would be required.
   Trade analysts suggest that as long as the Gephardt amendment is
a central part of the House bill, action on trade this year is
likely to remain paralyzed; and the better Gephardt does in the
primary campaigns, the harder it will be to win agreement on any
compromise trade bill.
   Actually, Democratic leaders have said privately for some time
that, at some point, the Gephardt amendment would have to be
dropped.
   However, deciding just how to go about it with the presidential
election year in full swing has all but frozen action on the trade
measure until now.
   Addressing the AFL-CIO executive council in Bal Harbour, Fla.,
last week, House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, predicted that the
conference panel would agree on ``something in between'' Gephardt's
proposal and the milder Senate version.
   The Senate bill calls for formal investigations that could lead
to sanctions against nations running large trade surpluses but
would not require blanket retaliation.

   A man awakened by three intruders searching
his apartment for a stolen jacket fatally shot one of them with a
crossbow, authorities said.
   James R. Hucek, 21, was killed after he and his two companions
burst into Tom Hedgecock's apartment early Saturday, according to
Jim Solomons, a spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's office.
   Gregory M. Farmer and Joseph Roehrick were being held without
bail after being charged with burglary and second-degree murder
under a state law that permits such prosecution for those involved
in a felony resulting in death.
   ``It was pretty traumatic,'' said the 27-year-old Hedgecock, who
was shot in the leg.
   Solomons said Hucek, Roehrick, 22, and Farmer, 25, spotted
Hedgecock's roommate when they were out driving late Friday.
   The three thought that the roommate, Kurt Chaillet, had
something to do with the theft of an expensive leather jacket that
belonged to one of them, Solomons said.
   Chaillet, 25, joined the three for driving and beer drinking and
later took them back to the apartment, where they confronted him
with their suspicions and demanded to search the apartment,
Solomons said.
   The search, which turned up no leather jacket, quickly turned
into a ransacking, and the noise woke Hedgecock, Solomons said.
   ``He told them to get out,'' Solomons said. When they refused,
Hedgecock armed himself with a screwdriver and forced them out.
   He locked and bolted the door, but the three kicked in the door
and pushed their way inside, where Hedgecock had armed himself with
a crossbow.
   He fired once, striking Hucek in the chest and killing him.
   The violence continued as Chaillet ran to call authorities. The
fight between Farmer, Roehrick and Hedgecock moved into the parking
lot, where Roehrick pulled a gun from his truck and shot twice,
hitting Hedgecock in the leg, Solomons said.
   When deputies arrived, they found Farmer and Roehrick in the
parking lot and Hedgecock sitting on his couch.

<TEXT>
   George Vassiliou, a Communist-backed
millionaire businessman, was formally proclaimed president today
and vowed to be flexible in seeking reunification of this
war-divided island.
   In his first foray into politics, the 56-year-old Vassiliou
narrowly defeated veteran conservative leader Glafcos Clerides in
Sunday's runoff.
   It was Cyprus' closest election since independence from Britain
in 1960.
   Vassiliou is committed to peace talks with the Turkish Cypriots
in the northern, Turkish-occupied part of Cyprus.
   He told thousands of jubilant and cheering supporters on Sunday
night that he would ``launch an unprecedented effort to promote a
settlement.''
   Vassiliou has promised to abandon the inflexible approach of
President Spyros Kyprianou, who insisted on the withdrawal of
30,000 Turkish troops and 65,000 mainland settlers from the north
as a precondition to resumed peace talks. Kyprianou had sought a
third five-year term, but was knocked out in the election's first
round on Feb. 14. He endorsed neither Vassiliou nor Clerides.
   In an acceptance speech broadcast by the state radio, Vassiliou
said he also will work for the withdrawal of the Turkish troops and
settlers and for the right of the 180,000 Greek Cypriot refugees to
return to their homes in the north. Turkey invaded the island in
1974 following a short-lived coup by Greek Cypriot extremists
favoring union with Greece.
   Rauf Denktash, president of the Turkish Cypriot breakaway state
established in 1983, has offered to meet the new president in
preliminary talks to break a 3-year-old deadlock in United
Nations-sponsored peace talks.
   Vassiliou, who ran as an independent with the support of the
powerful Communist Party, defeated Clerides on Sunday with 51.63
percent of the vote. He won 167,834 votes to 157,228 or 48.37
percent for the 68-year-old Clerides, said Kyriacos Christofi,
chief election official.
   Christofi formally proclaimed Vassiliou president early today in
a speech from the first-story balcony of the eight-story building
that houses Vassiliou's market research company, the largest in the
Middle East.
   The new president ordered cameramen of the state-run television
not to film leftists waving red flags in the crowd of 5,000
supporters gathered to cheer the proclamation.
   A pre-dawn victory rally in the capital's main square was called
off after minor scuffles between Vassiliou supporters and backers
of Clerides.
   Vassiliou repeatedly appealed for calm during his broadcast
speech and in earlier statements, declaring that he saw his
election as a victory for Cyprus.
   ``There is no victor or vanquished. We should all work for the
good of Cyprus,'' he said, stressing the need for national unity.
   Voting was compulsory for all Greek Cypriots over 21. More than
90 percent of the 363,000 registered voters cast valid ballots.
   Reunification was the main issue of the campaign, with both
Vassiliou and Clerides stressing the urgency of breaking a peace
talks deadlock to avoid the risk of international recognition for
the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state.
   The proclamation of a statelet by the 150,000 Turkish Cypriots
was branded invalid by the U.N. Security Council and has only been
recognized by Turkey.
   The Turkish Cypriots took no part in the election.
   The new president will be sworn in next Sunday.

<HEAD>Talks End Acrimoniously Between Pan Am, Teamsters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The union representing 4,500 Pan Am ground
employees in 14 cities vowed ``guerrilla warfare'' against the
airline after talks in which management is seeking $35 million in
concessions broke down.
   The Pan American World Airways reservation clerks and other
ground staff represented by the Teamsters continued working Sunday
after the union's 12:01 a.m. strike deadline passed.
   ``We can strike any time we want,'' said William Genoese,
director of the Teamsters airline division.
   ``We're going to pick our strategic time,'' Genoese said.
Meantime, he said, Teamsters would attempt to disrupt operations
through ``guerrilla warfare,'' starting immediately.
   ``There's going to be trouble on the job,'' he said. ``They're
not going to correct anybody's errors, they're not going to help
anybody, they're not going to do anything for anybody.''
   But a Pan Am spokesman, Jeff Kriendler, called Genoese ``the
jerk'' and said his words were ``completely ridiculous.''
   ``Whereas the leadership may be at warfare with Pan Am, the rank
and file are completely loyal to the company. It is not in their
hearts to turn their backs on their customers,'' Kriendler said.
   And, Kriendler added, any workers taking part in that warfare
would face ``discipline in the severest form.''
   A federal mediator said both sides told him they would act on
his request to reevaluate their positions.
   ``The board will stay in touch with the parties and there will
be a resumption of negotiations at an early and appropriate time,''
said Walter C. Wallace of the federal mediation board.
   Negotiations began late Saturday at Wallace's request, and
continued for six hours past the strike deadline. When talks broke
off Sunday morning, Teamsters leaders promised that union members _
reservation clerks, customer service agents and other clerical
staff _ would continue to work.
   The talks resumed in the afternoon at Pan Am headquarters here,
but recessed after about a half-hour when the company rejected the
mediator's call for arbitration, Genoese said.
   The dispute involves Pan Am's attempts to cut costs by $35
million through concessions by the Teamsters. The airline has said
it needs about $540 million in concessions from its unionized
employees during the next three years to ensure its survival.
   Asked about the major points of contention, Kriendler said,
``Let's say that the company long ago established a $35 million
objective of achieving cost reductions. What is negotiable is how
we reach the $35 million figure.''
   The company does not view the amount as negotiable, Kriendler
said, but the union maintains that it is.
   The company said it would maintain operations with replacement
workers in the event of a strike. The Transport Workers Union voted
Friday not to support a Teamsters' strike, and pilots, flight
attendants and flight engineers were not expected to honor picket
lines.
   The Teamsters represent workers at airports in Boston, Detroit,
Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Honolulu,
Houston, Washington, New York and the Florida cities of Tampa,
Orlando and Miami. The vast majority of the workers are employed in
New York and Miami.

<HEAD>Peres Worried About Soviet Role In Arranging Peace Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres says he
is concerned about the Soviet role in setting up Arab-Israeli peace
talks even as the Soviets pledged to be more of a factor in
negotiations.
   Peres, who favors an international conference to quell the
violence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, voiced doubts
about Soviet involvement in arranging such a conference.
   The deaths of two Arabs Sunday brought the number of
Palestinians killed by Israelis since the protests began Dec. 8 to
61, according to U.N. figures.
   ``What role the Russians will play depends on what role the
international conference will play,'' Peres said Sunday in an
interview from Jerusalem on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David
Brinkley.''
   ``I would never agree that any foreign country, Russia or other
country, will make decisions instead of us or will try to force us
to make a decision,'' Peres said. ``I don't accept the Russian
concept that an international conference should be an authoritative
conference. I think it should be an authorizing conference, namely
enabling the parties to negotiate among themselves freely.''
   Peres said he understood that Jordan, Egypt, Israel and the
United States share this view.
   The foreign minister said the conference ``should be like
somebody that opens the door to a new era, but not somebody who
replaces the residents in the house itself.''
   Peres also acknowledged Sunday that he sent a handwritten note
to Attorney General Edwin Meese III in 1985 about a proposed Iraqi
pipeline.
   Peres, who was Israel's prime minister at the time, previously
has denied writing to Meese that he supported the $1 billion,
540-mile pipeline project, which was never built.
   Meanwhile in Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, prior to meeting with Secretary of State George P.
Shultz, said that his government wants ``to play a more active role
_ also in the negotiations.''
   Shultz, who travels to Israel later this week, met with Soviet
officials to discuss the next superpower summit meeting between
President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the
Iran-Iraq war and the conflict in the Middle East.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel has resisted Soviet
participation in the search for a Middle East settlement. In
addition to not having relations with Israel, the Soviets generally
support Arab positions.
   The Soviets broke relations with Israel after it defeated Egypt,
then a Soviet ally, in the 1967 Mideast war. However, a small group
of Soviet diplomats was sent to Israel last year to take care of
some consular matters.
   Peres emphasized the urgent need for negotiations.
   ``I'm convinced that the time has really come _ which shouldn't
be postponed _ to start to negotiate and find a solution which will
answer the expressions of the Palestinians on one hand, and the
security call of Israel on the other,'' he said.
   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, interviewed on CBS-TV's
``Face the Nation,'' welcomed U.S. efforts to set up talks on
resolving the Mideast crisis and never was asked about a Soviet
role.
   ``I believe it's a very good idea to bring about a beginning of
a talking,'' Rabin said. ``After all, the problem that we face can
be solved only by political means. By military means, by force, we
can bring about tranquility but not a solution. ...
   ``We have a very great respect and trust to Secretary Shultz. We
believe that he is honest, decent human being and is trying his
best to bring about a beginning of a talk.''
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who appeared on the
ABC program, said negotiations should be conducted under U.S.
auspices and not Soviet authority.
   ``I have the gravest doubts about an international conference,''
Kissinger said. ``I have grave doubts about a Soviet role, unless
the Soviets are willing to ask of their Arab friends what we are
going to propose to our Israeli friends. So, I think that American
mediation is the best course.''

<HEAD>Nicaraguan President Says More Contra Aid Means More War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega charged that
U.S. lawmakers who are seeking to secure additional aid for the
Contra rebels are egotistically toying with Nicaraguan lives.
   Ortega said in a two-hour speech to the National Assembly on
Sunday that, despite a Feb. 4 vote in the House of Representatives
against a Reagan administration request for more Contra aid, ``this
chapter has not closed.''
   President Reagan, he said, will look for a way to get more money
to the rebels by calling the assistance humanitarian aid.
   ``If the (U.S.) Congress approves that type of financing, it
would be erasing the word peace that it wrote when it voted against
the funds, and would be putting (in) the word `war,''' Ortega said
in the speech, broadcast over a government national radio network.
   ``That is the little game of Congress, a Congress where many
interests, particularly egotistical, are involved and which is
playing with life, hunger, security and the self-determination of
the Nicaraguan people,'' he said.
   The House voted against Reagan's plan to give the Contras a
$36.2 million aid package that included about $3.6 million for
weapons and ammunition to help them in their 6{-year-old fight
against the leftist Sandinista government.
   Democrats prevailed in the vote, 219-211, after the party's
leadership promised members there would be a later chance to vote
on a package of Contra aid for food, clothing, medicine and shelter
only.
   A group of Democrats, together with one or two Republicans who
voted against the president's plan, have been trying to draw up
such an alternative.
   One proposal for the alternative aid request would give the
Contras humanitarian aid at a rate of about $1.8 million a month.
   Ortega said 26,500 people have been killed since the war began
and 23,882 wounded. Other, unofficial sources, have put the death
toll at more than 40,000. The war, he said, has cost the country
$3.6 billion.
   Damage to the economy was estimated at $376 million last year,
exceeding the $270 million in export earnings, he said.
   Even so, he said, the economy advanced at an inflation-adjusted
rate of 1.7 percent in 1987. It contracted 0.4 percent in 1986.
   The inflation rate skyrocketed to 1,347 percent last year, well
ahead of the 657 percent of the previous year.
   The government last week unveiled a new program to try to
control runaway inflationm. It introduced a new cordoba currency,
boosted prices of basic goods, increased salaries and cracked down
on speculators.

<HEAD>Dollar Down Slightly Against Yen; Stocks Close Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell slightly against the Japanese yen
today, closing at 129.95 yen, while stock prices in Tokyo rose
moderately.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which posted a 98.05-point gain last Friday, added
another 73.30 points or 0.29 percent to close the day's trading at
24,846.71 points. Volume in the first section was 870 million
shares.
   The dollar opened trading Monday at 129.95 yen, down 0.58 yen
from last Friday's close of 130.53, and ranged between 129.87 and
130.05 yen. Trading totaled $2.526 billion.
   ``There's absolutely nothing going on'' in the foreign exchange
market, said a trader at Goldman Sachs who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``The dollar's been moving in a 10-point range in
inactive trading. It's extremely, extremely quiet.''
   Traders said the dollar's relative stability against the yen was
behind the recent upswing of stock prices in Tokyo.
   Prospects of favorable trade and economic figures for fiscal
1987, which ends March 31, helped lift stock prices, said Kunihiro
Ono of Nomura Securities, Japan's largest brokerage.
   Other traders said share prices also were boosted by a report
published over the weekend that the Economic Planning Agency
foresees a 4 percent growth in Japan's gross national product in
1988.
   Dealers said buying interest faded and volume sagged after a
sharp rally in the morning session, as investors began to worry
about a correction following the market`s rally last week.
   Foods and retails, such as Seven-Eleven, had a fast speculative
run, along with securities companies and steels, which were
stronger earlier in the day but eased off in later trading,
according to Stephen Codrington of Jardine Fleming Ltd.
   Light electricals, constructions and pharmaceuticals also
firmed, while department stores and textiles fell back, other
traders said.

<HEAD>US Looking for Agreement on Portuguese Base</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Reagan administration is likely to find
out during a visit by Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva
this week if a proposed $46 million increase in military aid
satisfies Portugal's request for more compensation for U.S. use of
a major air base.
   Cavaco Silva's first trip to Washington since he took office
last August is expected to be dominated by discussion of the base
situation, which has injected a dose of sourness into an otherwise
sweet relationship between the two NATO nations.
   Portugal is getting $117 million in U.S. assistance this fiscal
year _ in NATO only Turkey and Greece got more _ but that was $30
million less than the fiscal 1987 payment.
   In the budget sent to Congress last week, Portugal would get
$163 million.
   Portugal wants $207 million a year, which U.S. negotiators
pledged in 1983 they would make their ``best efforts'' to provide
in return for a base-rights agreement that gives the United States
access to Lajes Air Base in the mid-Atlantic Azores islands.
   Besides being part of the NATO chain of bases, Lajes is viewed
by the Pentagon as an indispensable refueling point for mammoth
transports heading for the Middle East and Africa.
   The grumbling in Lisbon is similar to noises being heard in the
Philippines, Greece, Turkey and Spain _ allies seeking more
benefits from the United States in return for use of military
installations.
   ``Security cooperation is an important part of the relationship
between the United States and Portugal and obviously will be
discussed during the prime minister's visit,'' the Portuguese
embassy said in its announcement of Cavaco Silva's meetings, which
include talks with Reagan on Wednesday.
   ``There will be further discussions about promised economic
assistance,'' the embassy said.
   Under the terms of the base rights agreement, Portugal has the
right to demand a review of the pact at its mid-term, which occurs
this month. The form of the review is not spelled out, but U.S.
officials have said it could result in a demand by Portugal for
specific amounts of additional aid.
   After Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci visited Lisbon Feb.
3-4, the two countries announced an agreement under which Portugal
would hold off calls for a formal review of the pact and the United
States would supply surplus military equipment to compensate for
the aid cutback.
   Since then, however, the agreement has come under attack.
   Portuguese President Mario Soares said the surplus equipment
agreement is unsatisfactory.
   In a speech last Thursday, Portuguese Foreign Minister Joao de
Deus Pinheiro said he favored ``an update'' of the defense accord.
   Officials of both countries _ notably Pentagon and State
Department officers sympathetic to Portugal's requests and
frustrated by budget strictures _ have said the dispute is purely
financial.
   Unlike in Spain and Greece, where the voters support a reduced
U.S. military presence, there is widespread support for the
American bases in Portugal.
   ``The upcoming Portuguese-American negotiations shouldn't be
dramatized,'' Pinhero said. ``Our common interests and views far
exceed any possible bilateral difficulties.''

   Hijackers on Monday tried to commandeer a
China Airlines plane carrying 105 passengers on a domestic flight
but were foiled by crew members, officials of the airline reported.
   Officials of China Airlines, Taiwan's official flag carrier,
said the Boeing 737 was en route from Taipei to the southern port
of Kaohsiung, 240 miles away, when the hijack attempt occurred.
   China Airlines officials declined to identify the hijackers, say

   In 1985, an attempted hijacking occurred aboard a China

homesick army sergeant who wanted to see his parents was
overpowered by crew members after he seized a stewardess.

<TEXT>
   The new Pentagon budget has reopened the
bitter fight between Congress and the Reagan administration over
the MX nuclear missile and how to build America's future arsenal of
land-based atomic weapons.
   And in the latest round _ on a possible successor to the MX
missile _ past administration critics have gained grudging support
from an unusual quarter _ Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci.
   Although he personally doesn't think much of the Midgetman
missile, the congressionally designated heir apparent to the MX,
Carlucci has agreed to request enough funding to keep the project
alive until a new administration can make the final decision.
   The budget sent to the Democratic-controlled Congress last week
proposed $807 million to buy a dozen more of the 10-warhead MX
weapons, along with $793 million for a new method of basing the
giant missiles aboard trains.
   The current plan is to put 50 of the weapons into silos on
Warren Air Force Base in southeastern Wyoming. The Air Force also
wants to build 50 more and deploy two each aboard 25
specially-built trains.
   But Carlucci told the Senate Armed Services Committee last week
that if it were up to him, he would put all 100 MX weapons on the
trains.
   ``We badly need a survivable missile system,'' he explained.
   That statement echoed criticisms by MX opponents, who claimed
during a series of long fights in Reagan's first term that putting
the MX into land-based silos would make the missiles vulnerable to
a first strike by accurate Soviet missiles.
   Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger strongly disagreed
and pushed hard for approval for 100 of the weapons. They were to
replace some of the aging Minuteman missiles which now make up the
heart of America's land-based nuclear missile force.
   After a series of long fights, Congress finally agreed to put 50
of the weapons in land-based silos and then approved the
single-warhead Midgetman weapon as a successor to the MX. The Air
Force agreed with that plan, but later Reagan decided to try to win
approval for the second 50 MX weapons.
   Even as the budget was unveiled Thursday, MX critics were lining
up to oppose the railroad-basing plan.
   ``The debate concerning survivability has been raging for years
and apparently will continue,'' said Rep. Nicholas Mavroules,
D-Mass., one of the chief opponents of the weapon in Reagan's first
term.
   ``Based on the available data, serious questions remain
regarding the safety and survivability of that type of deployment
system,'' said Mavroules. ``Because of these lingering questions,
Congress must be concerned about the rashness of this proposal.''
   Another critic, Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., said ``rail garrison
would be vulnerable to more than Soviet missiles. Because
commercial rail lines would be used, the threat of terrorism and
sabotage must be considered serious.''
   ``Additionally, in light of the recent problems surrounding the
safety of our nation's rail system, it is not pleasant to
contemplate the thought of nuclear warheads being trundled around
through populated areas.''
   Both Mavroules and AuCoin promised to try to eliminate all money
for the rail-basing plan.
   Carlucci also said he wanted to kill the Midgetman program
because budgetary restraints made it necessary to choose between
Midgetman and the MX. But to meet a congressional request, he
included $200 million to keep the program alive until a new
president takes office next year.
   That met with the approval of Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee and a Midgetman supporter.
   ``I felt it would be a mistake to zero the program and I wanted
it kept alive for the next administration. This money seems to me
to meet that request,'' said Nunn, who helped defeat an attempt to
kill the Midgetman program two months ago.
   Of the 50 MX weapons to be deployed, 33 are now in their silos,
but only 20 of those are operational because of problems in
delivering the guidance systems. But Carlucci said that all 50 will
be in the silos by the end of 1988.

<HEAD>Dual-Fuel Cars Seen as Protection Against Price Hikes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cars and trucks capable of switching from one
fuel to another could discourage future oil price increases by
foreign producers, the Energy Department says.
   The department says dual-fuel motor vehicles, in sufficient
numbers on American highways, would offer that benefit even if the
foreign oil producers also supplied the second, non-petroleum fuel.
   In the first of a series of reports planned for this year on
alternate fuels, the department says enough twin-fuel vehicles
would have to be in use to switch away from about 1 million barrels
of oil a day.
   The United States uses almost 17 million barrels of oil per day,
a bit more than a third of it imported, and five-eighths of it
devoted to transportation.
   It would take a decade of spending several billion dollars a
year to build the plants and distribution system necessary for
significant switching ability to methanol or natural gas, the
report said.
   The department and many in the oil industry are worried that
imports will account for 60 percent of supplies by the middle of
the next decade. That would give the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries leverage it has been unable to exercise in the
surplus-sloshed soft markets of recent years, because OPEC will
then have the only spare production capacity available in the world.
   The department promised more detailed reports on the experience
of other countries, supply prospects, environmental effects and a
cost-benefit analysis later this year. The most recent report was
described as ``context and analytical framework.''
   ``Whatever strategy the country goes with has got to withstand
cyclical swings in oil prices,'' said Scott Campbell, director of
the office of policy, planning and analysis, whose staff did the
work.
   Though other approaches should be pursued, only methanol
``appears at this stage of the assessment to be a fuel with clear
potential for meeting a significant percentage of this country's
transportation fuel demand in the short run,'' the study said.
   The study director, Vito Stagliano, estimated that a dual-fuel
car would cost $50 to $350 more in volume production. Ford Motor
Co. already has produced several hundred.
   To cut oil demand by 1 million barrels a day, the report
estimated these needs:
   _Ten new methanol plants each year for a decade, costing a total
of $20 billion to $25 billion.
   _Development of 10,000 to 30,000 alternative-capable retail
outlets a year, with an eventual total of 150,000 stations costing
more than $5 billion in all. No cost estimate was given for
changing pipelines, barges and other distribution facilities to
methanol.
   _Methanol-compatible vehicles entering the motor vehicle fleet
at a rate of 1.5 million to 8 million a year. There are more than
170 million cars, trucks and buses on U.S. highways now.
   Except in emergencies, motorists would not use methanol unless
it were ``perceptibly less expensive'' _ more than two gallons of
methanol are needed to provide the mileage obtainable with a gallon
of gasoline.
   ``Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the very prospect of
seeing large volumes of the demand for oil translate into demand
for alternative fuels will in itself discourage future increases in
oil prices,'' the report said.
   Methanol is made most cheaply from natural gas. The report
observed that although the United States is the world's biggest
methanol producer, it has been a net importer since 1982, and
Middle Eastern countries can produce at half the U.S. cost.
   A future methanol market ``could be dominated by OPEC oil
suppliers, or it might be one in which those countries play a less
significant role,'' the report said.
   Middle Eastern countries could supply U.S. methanol needs
economically, but ``any increase in the total potential supply of
liquid fuels in the world should tend to enhance U.S. energy
security, because it would cause the world energy market to loosen
up,'' the report said.
   A methanol cartel that raised prices would call forth increased
supplies from elsewhere, just as oil output expanded elsewhere in
the 1970s after OPEC began steep price hikes, the report said.
   ``Because feedstocks of natural gas are more widely distributed,
even greater price competition would result in this case,'' it said.

<HEAD>California Makes Most from Military Contracts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   California continued to pace the nation last
year in the receipt of Pentagon contracts despite suffering a
significant drop in awards compared to the previous year, new
reports show.
   California also maintained its position as the state with the
largest Defense Department payroll, as well as the No. 1
destination for military retirees. Payroll and pension checks
combined pumped $12.7 billion into the California economy in fiscal
1987, the reports show.
   Nationally, the Pentagon awarded $147.12 billion in contracts
for work performed inside the United States during fiscal 1987 _ a
drop of $2.1 billion compared to fiscal 1986.
   It also paid out $84.5 billion in payroll and pensions during
the year to individuals retired or working inside the United
States, up $2.7 billion compared to the previous year.
   Of that $84.5 billion grand total, $26.3 billion went to pay
civilian employees in the 50 states; $34 billion went to pay
active-duty personnel in the 50 states; $5.5 billion went to pay
reservists and National Guard members, and $18.7 billion went to
retirees.
   The new figures are contained in two annual statistical reports
_ one known as the Defense Department ``Atlas'' and the other
entitled ``Prime Contract Awards by State'' _ that attempt to show
how Pentagon spending is affecting the 50 states.
   Those figures will be augmented in the coming months with
additional reports on such things as the nation's top defense
contractors; total contract actions, including work outside the
United States, and civilian and military employee comparisons.
   The state statistics for fiscal 1987 show that the 12 months
ending last Sept. 30 produced some unusually wide swings in
Pentagon spending patterns.
   For example, California easily paced the nation with military
contractors in that state winning $24.5 billion in awards. But that
total represented an 11.6 percent drop, or $3.2 billion less than
the $27.7 billion in contracts awarded in fiscal 1986.
   Similarly, Texas tumbled from second place to fourth in the
contract rankings because of 20.9 percent decline in awards, while
Virginia climbed from eighth to fifth thanks to a whopping 44.5
percent increase in awards.
   Texas finished the fiscal year with awards totaling $8.65
billion, while Virginia finished with $7.8 billion. Second place
went to New York with $9.6 billion, while third place went to
Massachusetts with $8.69 billion.
   The remainder of the top 10 included Missouri at sixth place
with $6 billion; Florida with $5.8 billion; Connecticut with $5
billion; Maryland with $4.75 billion, and Ohio with $4.5 billion.
   Even setting aside contracting, California benefited the most
from the Defense Department's presence, with $12.7 billion flowing
into the state in pension checks and salaries for civilian,
active-duty and reserve employees.
   Virginia, Texas, Florida and Georgia rounded out the top five,
retaining the same positions in fiscal 1987 they had the year
before. Virginia saw $8.8 billion flow into its borders in total
compensation, compared to $6.6 billion for Texas, $5.6 billion in
Florida and $3.2 billion in Georgia.
   The remainder of the top 10 included North Carolina with $3
billion in total compensation; Maryland with $2.74 billion;
Washington with $2.66 billion; Pennsylvania with $2.4 billion, and
South Carolina with $2.3 billion.
   Breaking down those figures to focus on retiree compensation,
the most money again flowed into California _ totaling $2.7
billion. Next was Texas with $1.9 billion, followed by Florida with
$1.88 billion; Virginia with $1.4 billion and Georgia with $682.5
million.

<HEAD>Effectiveness Of Anti-Drug Programs Needs Evaluating,
Investigators Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal watchdog says it is time to use a
few of the millions of dollars spent annually on anti-drug
education to answer a simple question: What works and what doesn't?
   That was the conclusion reached by Inspector General Richard
Kusserow after he was asked by the White House to evaluate a
variety of programs.
   In weeks of studying Nancy Reagan's ``Just Say No'' campaign and
two other antidrug efforts targeted at the very young,
investigators found more questions than answers.
   The main recommendation in a preliminary version of Kusserow's
report is that federal agencies ``should develop an evaluation
strategy to include long- and short-term evaluations of the
implementation and effectiveness of youth drug education programs.''
   Specifically, he said those strategies should be devised by the
Education Department and the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health
Administration.
   Kusserow, charged with monitoring programs of the Department of
Health and Human Services, agreed to discuss the study after The
Associated Press obtained a draft copy.
   He acknowledged that the document lacks the precision typically
associated with IG reports, but said that should not be read as an
indictment of any of the programs surveyed. In fact, he said, ``It
looks like they're on the right track.''
   But the former FBI agent said his investigators' attempts to
determine whether the programs are ``just fluff and puffery or
real'' were hampered by lack of measurable data.
   ``There is no evidence that seems to be available to tell us how
successful these programs are,'' he said. ``I think we've put the
first layer in, but if you want to have an ongoing, effective
program we're going to get more sophisticated. You cannot get
sophisticated until you start developing some objective criteria
and some instruments to measure progress.
   ``Our concern is that if these programs satisfy themselves that
they can relax on their laurels and sort of coast on to ever
increasing success, I think they're deluding themselves. If we want
to increase the effectiveness of the programs we are going to have
some sort of measurement that would allow them to know what are
successful techniques versus the less successful techniques.''
   Kusserow added: ``You're not talking about hoards of money to do
that. You're just saying that somewhere along the line they're
going to have to set aside some resource to look at how they can go
about developing a model they can measure.''
   And developing such measurements, he said, are beyond the scope
of the IG's office.
   In addition to ``Just Say No,'' a loosely knit association of
local efforts operating under a private foundation, the IG study
looked at the Boys Clubs of America's ``Smart Moves'' and the
National Federation of Parents' ``Drug Free Youth.''
   ``These programs sort of spontaneously came into being,''
Kusserow said, noting that each is financed almost totally at the
community level.
   He said each of the three should consider developing its own
criteria for measuring success and that someone _ perhaps the
federal Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration _
``might want to ask which one is best.''

   Kidnappers of a U.S. Marine officer
serving with the United Nations released on Monday a videotaped
message from the captive in which he pleaded with the U.S.
government to meet his captors' demands.
   Lt. Col. William R. Higgins appeared reading from a statement in
the 70-second tape that was released by the Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth to a Western news agency office in Beirut.
   He wore a dark green sweater and a newly grown beard.
   ``I, William Higgins, in order to get me released, these demands
have to be met,'' said the 43-year-old decorated Vietnam veteran
and one-time military assistant to former Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger.
   Higgins was abducted near south Lebanon's ancient port city of
Tyre on Wednesday. In the videotape, he looked gloomy, but
physically fit.
   Higgins said President Reagan ``has to take responsibility for
the crimes he has committed against the oppressed people in the
region.''
   He listed the same demands made by his captors when they first
claimed his abduction in a statement Friday that branded the Marine
colonel a spy for the ``satanic CIA.''
   The demands, as listed by Higgins, are:
   _Withdrawal of Israeli forces from all occupied territories in
Lebanon.
   _The release of all detained Lebanese and Palestinian
Mujahedeen, or Holy Warriors, from the Khiam detention camp, in
south Lebanon, and all jails of ``the Zionist regime in occupied
Palestine.''
   _An end to U.S. intervention in Lebanon and to U.S. diplomatic
missions to the Middle East.

<HEAD>US Schools Issue More Education Doctorates Than Any Other Kind</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American universities have awarded more
doctorates in education than in any other field over the past two
decades, and women outnumber men among the newest Ph.D.s, a
government study says.
   ``Education has been the most popular field of choice for
doctoral study since 1966,'' said the report by the Department of
Education's Center for Statistics.
   The report, based on federal surveys, said that in 1966,
education held a narrow lead over the physical sciences as the most
popular field of doctoral-level study. Of the 18,239 doctorates
awarded by U.S. universities that year, 3,063, or 17 percent, were
in education, compared to 3,045 in the physical sciences.
   In 1986, education was still in the No. 1 spot, but by a much
wider margin. It accounted for 7,110, or 21 percent, of the 33,653
Ph.D.s awarded. The physical sciences again were second with 3,551.
   But education's share of doctorates peaked in 1977 at 7,960 and
has declined steadily since then as fewer men pursued the advanced
degree. Men outnumbered women four-to-one among the education
Ph.D.s in 1966. Women took the lead in 1983 and outnumbered the men
in 1986, 3,795 to 3,315.
   The 7,110 education Ph.D.s in 1986 was the lowest since 1972.
   The report, ``Profile of Education Doctorates: 1976 to 1986,''
was written by the center's Susan T. Hill, P. Elaine Kroe and
Summer D. Whitener.
   Education administration and supervision was the most popular
specialty, accounting for 1,622 of the Ph.D.'s in 1986. Some 787
were in curriculum and instruction, 609 in higher education, 323 in
educational psychology and 315 in counseling and personnel services.
   A total of 1,141 of the Ph.D.s were in various subjects or
teaching fields, with physical education, health and recreation the
most popular (291), followed by reading education (134), music
education (94), trade and industrial education (86) and English
education (79).
   The report said 194 of the 438 doctoral-granting institutions in
the United States awarded education Ph.D.s in 1986. The top 10
were: Temple University, 171; University of Pittsburgh, 165;
Columbia University-Teachers College and Nova University, both 163;
Vanderbilt University, 149; Michigan State University 139;
University of Georgia, 129; University of Texas-Austin, 125;
University of Maryland-College Park, 124; University of
Massachusetts-Amherst, 112.
   Foreign students received 700, or nearly 10 percent of the
education doctorates in 1986.

<HEAD>Celeste Predicts Presidential Nominations Will Hinge on Ohio</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Richard Celeste says he believes the Ohio
primary election this May will determine the presidential nominees
for both the Democrats and the Republicans.
   Celeste said Sunday he thinks the state will play the pivotal
role because the May 3 primary will fall at a key time in the
nominating process and because of the nature of the state.
   ``I think that the Ohio primary will determine who the nominee
is for each of the parties,'' Celeste said in answer to a question
at a news conference. ``They (the winners) may not have all the
delegates, but I think ... it will be clear that they are going to
be the first-ballot choice.''
   ``Any nominee understands that to win the general election, they
must carry Ohio,'' said Celeste. ``Our state is kind of a fulcrum
in the political process, it seems to me.''
   Celeste said it is too early for him to try to influence the
nominating process by endorsing a candidate, but that he may do so
prior to the Ohio primary.

<HEAD>Republicans Vote To Ban Pre-Primary Endorsements</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The California Republican Party has
voted to prohibit any endorsement by either the statewide party or
any official Republican county central committee prior to the GOP
primary.
   In a three-day convention, noteworthy principally for the
absence of all of the party's presidential candidates who are
campaigning in states with ``Super Tuesday'' primaries on March 8,
the only other significant business was adoption of new rules for
naming members to the party's governing board.
   The ban on endorsements Sunday was in response to a 1986 court
ruling that a state law prohibiting such endorsements violated
constitutional free speech guarantees. However, that ruling left
the political parties free to adopt any rules they want restricting
themselves.
   Contrary to the GOP action Sunday, the California Democratic
party is expected to adopt rules permitting pre-primary
endorsements at its statewide convention next month.

<HEAD>O'Neill Gives Primary Scorecard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The presidential primary scorecard, in the
view of former House Speaker Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill, allows for
more than one ballot at the Democratic convention and division
among Republicans.
   In his first public appearance since surgery late last year for
rectal cancer and an enlarged prostate, O'Neill told a convention
crowd of 2,000 on Saturday that Missouri Congressman Dick Gephardt
doesn't have the financing to run a successful race and Tennessee
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. may have waited too late to join the fray.
   Jesse Jackson will control a sizable block of votes and make the
convention, which O'Neill believes ``is going to go more than one
ballot, and there are going to be a lot of smoke-filled rooms.''
   O'Neill backs a fellow Massachusetts politician, Gov. Michael
Dukakis.
   On the GOP side, O'Neill said Vice President George Bush got his
timing back with his win in New Hampshire, but Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole ``has a Democratic style and can distance himself
from the administration.''
   But internal strife may hurt Republicans, he told members of the
National Electrical Manufacturers Representatives Association.

<HEAD>DOE Reduces Savannah River Reactor Level After Scientists Warn of
Danger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Managers of a federal nuclear plant in South
Carolina said a recent power-level reduction was ``routine,'' but a
published report today says the action came after scientists
discovered that safety equations had been wrong for decades.
   The Washington Post reported that power levels at the Savannah
River weapons material plant reactor were reduced following a
stormy meeting during which private scientists warned that the
reactor was operating beyond the demonstrated capacity of its
emergency cooling system.
   Managers of Savannah River called the 10 percent reduction in
power _ the third reduction in 14 months _ a ``routine'' action
reflecting a change in the way reactor temperatures are measured.
The reduction dropped the operating level from 1,100 megawatts
thermal to 960 megawatts.
   Power had already been reduced from 2,200 megawatts last March
when a National Academy of Sciences panel warned that a severe
accident could overpower the reactor's cooling system.
   The Post, quoting sources it did not identify, said the latest
reduction Feb. 12 was ordered only at the insistence of scientists
working for E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., DOE's contractor at
Savannah River. The scientists had discovered a fundamental error
in the calculations that have been used for decades to justify
reactor operating levels, the newspaper said.
   Department of Energy officials initially were reluctant to order
the reduction because they didn't want to admit they had made a
mistake and risk triggering public pressure to close the South
Carolina facility, the Post reported.
   DOE confirmed that the power levels at the L reactor _ one of
three government reactors at the Savannah River facility and the
last Energy Department facility that produces plutonium _ were
reduced Feb. 12, the newspaper said.
   Savannah River manager Robert L. Morgan decided to reduce the
levels following a confrontation with the scientists at a Feb. 8
meeting during which a top du Pont scientist threw his security
badge on the table in front of Morgan and threatened to ``go
public'' unless the power levels were lowered, the Post's sources
said.
   ``Morgan blinked,'' one source told the Post.
   An unidentified DOE official told the newspaper that the
department did not want to ``raise the specter of continuing
problems at Savannah River.''

<TEXT>
   President Reagan says nothing would make him
happier during his last year in office than to see all of the
American hostages in Lebanon freed.
   ``I'd like that better than anything else,'' Reagan told
reporters during a black-tie reception Sunday night for the
nation's governors. He said the administration is ``doing
everything we can and exploring every avenue'' to free Marine Lt.
Col. William R. Higgins, who was kidnapped Wednesday near the
ancient port city of Tyre, Lebanon.
   ``It's just so difficult,'' Reagan said. ``It is such a terrible
situation and you're afraid you'll do something that will harm them
(the hostages). We don't know who they (the captors) are or where
they are.''
   Higgins headed a 76-man observer group attached to a U.N.
peacekeeping force in south Lebanon. There are eight other
Americans as well as 14 other foreigners missing in Lebanon.
   ``I just feel anytime a citizen of this country is unjustly
denied their constitutional rights, it's the obligation of this
government to come to their aid,'' Reagan said.
   Then, looking at the reporters, he said, ``I wish you would stop
calling them terrorists and start calling them cowards.''

<HEAD>Sister of Longest-Held Hostage Says Government Has Double Standard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sister of the longest-held American
hostage in Lebanon says U.S. officials display a double standard by
working hardest to free the most recent captives.
   Peggy Say, who has unflinchingly worked for freedom for her
brother Terry Anderson, said Reagan administration officials
indicated recently that no progress has been made to win his
release.
   ``I will not stand by and watch somebody else come out while my
brother stays behind,'' Mrs. Say said in an interview broadcast
Sunday on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation.''
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, was abducted March 16, 1985. He is among nine Americans
being held hostage in Lebanon, including recent abductee Marine Lt.
Col. William R. Higgins, who was kidnapped Wednesday.
   Mrs. Say charged that a double standard exists in which U.S.
officials actively tried to locate Higgins, but have not been as
vigorous in trying to find her brother.
   She added that the double standard is not new, and she cited
U.S. efforts to free Americans held hostage in the hijacking of a
TWA jetliner and the cruise ship Achille Lauro and the negotiations
to win the release of journalist Nicholas Daniloff, who was
arrested by the Soviets.
   She said that during a State Department meeting several months
ago, she was told that ``their policy was absolute non-negotiations
for Terry and the others.''
   ``I reminded them that they had told me that before TWA and I
watched those negotiations,'' she said. ``And then they got back to
me and said, now we're back to our old policy, no negotiations. I
watched Achille Lauro and I watched Nick Daniloff.
   ``And I said to them a couple of months ago, I do not intend to
stand by again and watch you break that public policy when it is
politically expedient for you to do so.''
   President Reagan said Thursday he wants ``to rescue'' Higgins,
who headed the 75-man observer group attached to the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon, but officials played down the idea of a
military mission to gain the officer's release.

<HEAD>Two Years After Marcos, Aquino Administration More Secure Than
Ever</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT H. REID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino, who has
weathered coup attempts and other political storms, begins her
third year in office Thursday more secure in power than at any time
during her administration.
   But many who saw the Feb. 22-25, 1986, uprising against
President Ferdinand Marcos as the beginning of a new era in
Philippine politics are disappointed that dreams of social progress
and reform remain unrealized.
   The coalition that propelled Mrs. Aquino to power _ reformist
soldiers, human rights activists, the church and business groups _
has been shattered in the bickering that followed.
   Two years after Marcos' downfall, land reform remains bogged
down in Congress. Human rights groups that once castigated Marcos
for the abuses of his administration now raise similar charges
against the Aquino government.
   During a radio broadcast Sunday, Mrs. Aquino described her first
two years in office as ``very difficult.''
   ``I do not describe it as enjoyment,'' she said. ``But
definitely it is fulfillment of the highest decree.'' She said
improving the economic condition of the Filipino people would be
her first priority in the coming year.
   Last week, the major topic of Manila newspapers was a debate
over calls for a ``limited state of emergency,'' raising dark
memories of the worst excesses of the Marcos era.
   ``It appears that the anniversary will confirm the demise of a
failed reformist revolution,'' wrote commentator Amando Doronila in
The Manila Chronicle. ``It will show that the revolution, two years
after, is like a crushed ant hill, with its inhabitants scurrying
about without direction and in disarray.''
   Despite the disillusionment, most Western and Philippine
analysts doubt that disgruntled military officers, Marcos loyalists
or communist rebels can topple the popular 55-year-old widow before
her term expires on June 30, 1992.
   Military challenges to the Aquino administration reached their
high-water mark in August, when mutineers seized media and military
installations before being driven off about 15 hours later.
   The leader of the August attempt, Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan, was
arrested in December. Ironically, he played a major role in the
Feb. 22, 1986, military mutiny that triggered the popular uprising
Mrs. Aquino rode to power.
   Most analysts believe that communist rebels appear to lack both
the military strength and political following to topple Mrs. Aquino
within the next four years.
   ``The question used to be, `Will Cory make it to 1992?''' said
one Western analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Now it
is, `What will she do in the rest of her term?'''
   Beyond surviving, the principal achievement of the Aquino
administration has been the restoration of popular democracy,
marked by ratification of a liberal constitution and the elections
of senators, congressmen and regional officials.
   Last week, however, Senate President Jovito Salonga noted that
there were 700 allegations of fraud in the Jan. 18 regional
election. He said those who believe real democracy has been
restored ``are more obsessed with theory than actual fact.''
   Prospects for broad social, economic and political reform have
been clouded by a $28 billion debt, a cumbersome legislature and
political polarization widened by the 19-year-old communist
insurgency and the military's rising clout.
   For much of her term, Mrs. Aquino faced serious challenges from
the military, and she owes her political survival in part to a
faction under Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos.
   As chief of staff, Ramos held most of the armed forces behind
the government and fended off the six coup plots. But social
activists fear her reliance on Ramos has lessened the government's
commitment to reform.
   The government so far has not prosecuted soldiers for alleged
involvement in several widely publicized killings of civilians. Nor
has it fulfilled Mrs. Aquino's 1986 campaign promise to abolish the
Civilian Home Defense Force, a military-backed militia widely
accused of human rights abuses.
   And the government has endorsed formation of about 200
anti-communist vigilante groups, which human rights activists and
church groups have accused of widespread abuses.
   ``She had one thing which could have put aside these
challenges,'' said Mariss Diokno, a prominent human rights
activist. ``And that was the people. Instead of turning to the
people, she turned to the military to bail her out. That is the
tragic element.''
   Friction between the military and civilian branches burst into
the open last week over proposals for the limited state of
emergency to deal with communist rebels.
   Brig. Gen. Honesto Isleta, Ramos' former spokesman, suggested
such a step to deal with the communists. Rep. Eduardo Gutang, a
retired general, proposed a national security act similar to those
in Malaysia and Singapore, which allow for detention without charge
for 60 days.
   After criticism from liberal congressmen and the Manila press,
Ramos said there was no need for a state of emergency. But he
called for ``tougher laws,'' including a national identity card
system, longer detention for suspected rebels and reimposition of
the death penalty.
   Sen. Rene Saguisag, a former presidential spokesman and human
rights lawyer, accused the military of ``blackmail,'' and Sen.
Teofisto Guingona branded the identity card system as the trappings
of a police state.
   In a page-one commentary Sunday, the pro-Aquino Philippine Daily
Star said the ouster of Marcos had given the country ``a new lease
on life, a new chance to make dreams ... into realities.''
   It added: ``Today, all those dreams remain, for the most part,
still dreams.''

   Motorists paid an average half-cent a gallon
less for gasoline during the past two weeks than during the
previous two weeks, but prices should rise soon, an analyst says.
   The average retail price of gasoline fell to 96.12 cents per
gallon since the Feb. 5 survey of prices at 15,000 gas stations
nationwide, Trilby Lundberg said Sunday.
   As of Feb. 19, the average for all grades and types of service
including taxes was 96.12 cents, compared with 96.59 cents on Feb.
5, Ms. Lundberg said.
   Average wholesale prices showed virtually no change, meaning a
loss in the retail operating margin of more than a half cent, the
survey said.
   That, plus the heavier demand for gasoline in warmer weather
will add to existing upward pressure on prices, Ms. Lundberg said.

   A U.S. aerospace consulting firm has signed a
multiyear agreement to put commercial scientific projects aboard
the Soviet space station in the first private American deal with
the Soviet space agency.
   Payload Systems Inc. of Wellsley, Mass., in an enterprise
approved by the Commerce Department, will grow protein crystals for
U.S. industry with the help of a Soviet cosmonaut who will be given
only minimal information about the projects, said Anthony Arrott,
company research and development director.
   Payload Systems received a two-year government license to
contract with the Soviets for protein crystallization production
experiments aboard the Soviet space station Mir, which is already
in orbit, Arrott said in a telephone interview Sunday.
   ``It's a multiflight, multiyear agreement beginning in 1989,''
he said, adding that part of the agreement includes non-disclosure
of the amount to be paid to the Soviets who reportedly have offered
to carry Western experiments for between $10,000 and $15,000 a
kilogram.
   Arrott said the agreement was signed with the Soviet Union's
agency for international trade agreements, Licensintorg. The
civilian space agency, Glavkosmos, oversees the space station.

<HEAD>Federal Railroad Administrators Sees Dismal Rail Safety Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rash of railroad accidents last month should
show Congress that serious problems remain in the industry since
the worst wreck in Amtrak history 14 months ago, says Federal
Railroad Administrator John Riley.
   Equally troubling, Riley said, is that the federal government
has less power to curtail railroad accidents now than it did when
three Conrail locomotives slid through a warning signal and
collided with an Amtrak passenger train near Chase, Md., on Jan. 4,
1987. Sixteen people were killed.
   ``It's incredible to me that we're sitting here 14 months after
the Chase accident and not one shred of legislation introduced in
the wake of that accident has yet become law,'' Riley said during
an interview he requested to talk about safety concerns. ``As the
months pass, I see the opportunity slipping away from us,'' he said.
   Riley has been lobbying for measures before House-Senate
conference committees that would permit direct government sanctions
against railroad workers for safety violations, and authorize
random drug testing.
   Delays in enacting the sanctions measure is ``testimony to the
sheer political power of the labor organizations who oppose it,''
Riley said. The measure would permit the FRA to suspend the
operating privilege of railroad conductors or engineers.

   Viewers of the CBS affiliate in the Washington
area, may have had a sense of deja vu when WUSA-TV mistakenly began
its ``Face The Nation'' broadcast with last week's preview of the
New Hampshire primary.
   Commentator Lesley Stahl started Sunday's show with, ``Welcome
to `Face The Nation,' this is Lesley Stahl in New Hampshire,'' and
spoke of what would happen in last Tuesday's primary.
   The error was not detected until more than five minutes into the
show.
   At that point, Republican presidential candidate Pat Robertson
was talking about prophecies concerning the ``forces of evil'' in
the world and an embattled Israel. The tape was abruptly cut, and
the show picked up with this week's broadcast and Ms. Stahl in
mid-sentence asking Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin about
Israeli forces being out of control in the West Bank.
   Diane Digit, WUSA publicity manager, said as soon as engineers
realized they were mistakenly running last week's show, they
switched to a tape containing the correct broadcast.

<HEAD>Dentists From Across the Globe Meet To Discuss AIDS and Lasers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS and lasers top the list of issues as
thousands of dentists gathered for the 123rd midwinter meeting of
the Chicago Dental Society.
   Only a few dentists now use lasers as surgical tools to remove
lesions and damaged soft tissue from around gums. But experts
predict dentists will soon use lasers to do everything from fitting
crowns to drilling cavities, said Harvey Wigdor, chief of dental
service at Ravenswood Hospital Medical Center.
   The four-day conference, which started Sunday, is expected to
attract 27,000 dentists and technicians from 26 countries.
   AIDS poses challenges because of the small chance of dentists'
contracting it from patients and the difficulty of treating
symptoms of the disease, said Dr. Sol Silverman, chairman of Oral
Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.
   Silverman said he will urge dentists to wear gloves to protect
themselves from contracting AIDS from patients. He said he would
impress upon them they are legally and morally obligated to treat
people with AIDS.
   Only one dentist is believed to have contracted AIDS by treating
patients with the deadly virus without taking the proper
percautions. Another dentist has tested positive for antibodies to
the virus, but has not yet shown symptoms of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome, Silverman said.
   ``The risk of contracting the virus is very, very low _ but why
take the chance?'' he said.
   AIDS patients develop many symptoms that must be treated by a
dentist, such as mouth lesions, ulcers, fungus and other lumps and
bumps, he said.
   Silverman said he will instruct dentists how to treat these
problems and give them information on how to refer the AIDS
patients if the dentist can not handle treatment.
   He said he would instruct dentists how to spot early symptoms of
AIDS and how to refer them for additional medical assistance.
   A French Dentist, Francois Duret of Marseilles University, was
scheduled to present his new computerized laser systems, which may
revolutionize current procedures for crowns and bridges, Dental
Society spokesman Allen Rafalson said.
   Doctors discussed the future uses of lasers at preconference
workshops at Ravenswood hospital Saturday.
   Lasers offer the advantages of being bloodless, very clean and
causing less post-treatment pain, he said.
   David Harris of the Wenske Laser Center said his laboratory is
trying to develop a laser drill ``to get rid of the noise and
vibration ... that patients find so adverse'' when they are having
cavities drilled.
   The high cost of laser equipment _ $20,000 to $25,000 _ prevents
most individual dentists from purchasing it, Widgor said.
   But Widgor and Harris, who helped organize the workshops, said
prices are expected to drop dramatically in the next few years to
an affordable level.

   A moderate earthquake shook central
California, jarring residents awake as it sent dishes rattling and
house beams creaking but caused no injuries or major damage,
officials said.
   The quake, measuring 3.9 on the Richter scale, hit at 11:43 p.m.
Sunday, and was centered about 40 miles west-northwest of
Bakersfield, said Robert Finn, spokesman for the California
Institute of Technology's seismology laboratory in Pasadena.
   Shaking was felt over a broad area in Kern and San Luis Obispo
counties, and as far north as Paso Robles, about 75 miles away.
   ``It rattled some dishes and caused some attic beams to creak,
but after the initial fright, most of our callers settled right
down,'' said San Luis Obispo County Sheriff's Sgt. Gary Hogan.
   ``We've had about a dozen calls, spread out over about 40
miles,'' Hogan said. ``It woke people up, but there weren't any
reports of injury or damage.''
   Residents in Bakersfield and nearby Taft felt the ground shake,
but Taft police officers said they barely noticed the temblor.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. An earthquake of 3.5 on the open-ended scale can
cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5
considerable damage, 6 severe damage.

<TEXT>
   Passengers and crew members on a China
Airlines flight today prevented a Taiwanese man from hijacking the
plane to Beijing by hitting him over the head and wrestling him to
the floor, the airline said.
   The Boeing 737 jetliner was carrying 114 people, including one
American, on a flight from Taipei to the southern port city of
Kaohsiung, 240 miles away, when the hijack attempt by the
29-year-old man occurred.
   The man, an employee at a knife grinding shop, was carrying two
fake grenades made of wood and a slip of paper from a fortuneteller
predicting a year of bad luck, the airline said at a news
conference.
   According to the airline, the would-be hijacker was subdued
after a crew member hit him on the head with a ``hard object.''
   No injuries were reported among the other 106 passengers and
seven crew members aboard the jetliner. The plane landed at
Kaohsiung and later returned to Taipei where members of the cabin
crew appeared at a press conference.
   Stewardess Lee Lin said she was passing out drinks to the
passengers about 20 minutes after takeoff when the would-be
hijacker, Chien Chu-yuan, handed her a slip of paper demanding the
plane be diverted to Beijing.
   ``He threatened on the slip of paper that he would kill all of
us with his two grenades if we didn't fly to Beijing,'' she said.
The man later said he wanted to go to Taipei, but crew members said
he was nervous and probably meant Beijing. The would-be hijacker
claimed to have two partners, but the airline has ruled out that
possibility.
   The stewardess asked four stewards for help as most passengers
remained unaware of the unfolding drama. The stewards and a few
passengers then pounced on the hijacker when he tried to show the
phony grenades to the passengers and subdued him after a 10-minute
scuffle.
   ``We asked the captain to fly in circles and told the hijacker
we would divert to Beijing,'' said steward Chi Hsi-an.
   Police said the would-be hijacker, a native Taiwanese who worked
in his brother's knife grinding shop, was in custody in Kaohsuing.
Attempted hijacking can carry the death sentence in Taiwan.
   Officials were unsure how many foreigners were aboard the plane
besides the one American. Among the passengers was Yu Chen
Yueh-ying, the Kaohsiung county magistrate who is an opposition
member.
   In 1985, an attempted hijacking occurred aboard a China
Airlines' Boeing 737 flying the same route with 107 passengers. In
that incident, a homesick army sergeant who wanted to see his
parents was overpowered by crew members after he seized a
stewardess.

<HEAD>Soviet Leader: Mao Wanted to Lure U.S. Troops Into Nuclear Trap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Andrei Gromyko says he rebuffed
Mao Tse-tung's proposal that the Soviet Union help lure U.S. troops
into China where they would be attacked by nuclear weapons, a
newspaper reported today.
   Gromyko's two-volume memoir covers nearly 50 years of Soviet
diplomacy, including dealings with nine American presidents,
according to The New York Times, which said an advance copy was
made available to its Moscow bureau.
   In ``Memoir,'' expected to be distributed to bookstores in the
next few weeks by its Soviet publisher, Gromyko says Mao's proposal
came during a secret visit to Beijing in August 1958.
   Gromyko, Soviet foreign minister from 1957 to 1985, said he was
surprised by the audacity of the plan, according to the Times.
   ``The scenario of war described by you cannot meet a positive
response by us,'' Gromyko said he told Mao. ``I can say this with
certainty.''
   Gromyko, 78, wrote that Mao was anticipating an American attack
on China because of tensions over the islands of Quemoy and Matsu,
off mainland China.
   Mao said Chinese forces would retreat to the heartland of China,
luring American soldiers after them. Then, Mao proposed, ``the
Soviet Union should catch them with all its means,'' Gromyko wrote.
   At the time, China was expecting to receive nuclear weapons from
the Soviet Union, but Moscow withdrew their offer in 1959. Soviet
officials later accused Mao of recklessness. China exploded its own
nuclear bomb in 1964.
   Gromyko denies reports that he misled President Kennedy about
the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba during the 1962 missile
crisis.
   ``In spite of several allegations circulating in the West, not
once in the whole course of the conversation did Kennedy raise the
question of the presence of Soviet missiles in Cuba,'' he wrote.
   ``Consequently, I did not have to answer whether or not there
were such weapons in Cuba.''
   Gromyko, who dealt with every U.S. president from Franklin D.
Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan reserved special praise for Roosevelt.
   He describes Roosevelt as someone ``who knew how to conduct
conversation freely, without any tension,'' and a leader who knew
how to make and carry out policy.
   He also described meetings with American stars such as Marilyn
Monroe, whom he met during a Hollywood reception for Soviet
officials in 1959. He said they exchanged a few words, and he
recalled her ``special and indescribable attractiveness.''

   Every year the Chamber of Commerce manages
to find volunteers to taste more than 100 bottles of homemade wine
for the Newport Wine and Seafood Festival.
   It's hard work, some of the 27 volunteer judges tapped this year
said over the weekend.
   ``We taste a lot of different wines and try to decide, try to be
objective,'' Opal White said. ``We don't want to say anything bad
about them, but some of them ....'' She trailed off, perhaps not
wishing to leave a bitter aftertaste.
   Since wine can be made from nearly anything organic, some of the
entries are, well, unusual. Garlic, dried kiwi fruit, rose petals,
zucchini and even sauerkraut have found their way into bottles
during past competitions.
   ``A little sauerkraut wine is good on a cold night,'' judge
Joseph Swafford said dryly.
   Stomach aches are unlikely, since the rules say the judges are
supposed to sniff, swirl, taste and spit. Still, the volunteer
judges must sign a waiver releasing the chamber from any blame
should they be struck with a sudden illness, and nobody else is
allowed the taste the amateur wines that are displayed at the
festival.
   The festival, which opened Friday and runs through Feb. 28,
allows the public to taste commercial wines, and compare their
choices with results from a panel of professional judges.

   Whales are coming to Lake Michigan.
   The Shedd Aquarium says its Oceanarium, a $43 million expansion
project that should be completed by 1990, will exhibit six whales,
four dolphins, several sea otters and a rookery of penguins.
   The Oceanarium design calls for huge rocks, cliffs and 35-foot
trees on 1.8 acres of what was Lake Michigan before 30 million
gallons of water was siphoned so construction could begin below
lake level in August.
   To give the illusion the whales are in the ocean, a
600-foot-long 35-foot-high picture window will overlook the lake
from behind their tanks.
   ``I've got a gut feeling that we might even have to turn people
away,'' aquarium director William P. Braker said recently as cranes
pounded 75-foot-long steel pilings for the foundation. ``We had 1.1
million visitors in 1987, and with the Oceanarium, I think we may
hit 2 million.''
   Three milk-white, 15-foot beluga whales will be airlifted from
Churchill, Manitoba on the Hudson Bay, aquarium officials said. As
whales go, Manitobas are small, but the largest animal now at Shedd
is a 7-foot nurse shark.
   Three more Pacific black whales, about the size of Manitobas,
will be brought from Japan, the aquarium staff said.
   Braker said Shedd, which opened in 1929 and is the world's
largest indoor aquarium at 230,000 square feet, ``needed a good
shot in the arm to bring it out of many years of being static.''
   Money for the Oceanarium includes $5 million each from the state
and the Chicago Park District. The aquarium has spent $8 million
and hopes to raise the remainder of the $25 million price tag
through donations.

   The dollar drifted lower against most major
currencies in light European trading early today. Gold prices rose
after dipping in Hong Kong.
   Traders attributed the dollar's weakness to general bearish
sentiment fueled by uncertainty over the state of the U.S. economy.
   ``The dollar's short-term trend is definitely down,'' said a
senior trader in Milan, Italy. ``Some people might like to see the
dollar rise, but what fresh news is there to support it?''
   A trader in Frankfurt, West Germany, said the dollar had been
boosted by a narrowing of the U.S. trade deficit, but ``you can't
hang on the trade data only _ you need something else to chew on.''
   Midmorning dollar rates in Europe compared with late rates
Friday:
   _ 1.7020 West German marks, down from 1.7075
   _ 1.3938 Swiss francs, down from 1.3985
   _ 5.7533 French francs, down from 5.7675

   Police clashed with about 100
separatist demonstrators today at a hospital construction site, and
authorities said 10 officers were injured and a dozen were taken
hostage in the melee.
   Philippe Berges, chief of staff at the High Commission, said the
protesters at Poindimie on the east side of the South Pacific
island were demanding a halt to work on the site. The work began
Friday.
   ``There will be no negotiations until the gendarmes have been
freed,'' Berges said.
   He said the team of gendarmes, a police force under military
direction, showed great restraint by not firing their weapons when
they were attacked with stones and sticks.
   The gendarmes fired tear gas grenades to get free of the
demonstrators, but some of the officers were captured and disarmed.
   Berges said reinforcements were being sent to the scene, where
Melanesian supporters of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation
Front, known by its French initials FLNKS, are opposed to building
of the hospital on what they say is land belonging to the Tieti
tribe.
   New Caledonia, a French overseas territory of 145,000 people
about 1,100 miles east of Australia, voted against independence in
a referendum last September.
   The indigenous Melanesians make up 42.6 percent of the
population, Europeans 37.1 percent and other nationalites the rest.

   Ms. Seydell, a resident of suburban Roswell, once said she

<HEAD>Reports: Fugitive Member of Nasser Family To Return To Face
Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEJLA SAMMAKIA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Family members denied published reports the
exiled eldest son of the late President Gamal Abdel Nasser will
return home to face charges that he participated in attacks on
Israeli and American diplomats.
   An opposition weekly, Sawt-el-Arab, on Sunday quoted the
fugitive, Khaled Abdel Nasser, as saying he planned to return from
exile in Yugoslavia to stand trial. If convicted, he could face the
death penalty.
   The state-run newspaper Al-Akhbar reported today that entry
points in Egypt were placed on alert for the possible return of
Khaled. Al-Akhbar also said Ahmad el-Khawaga, a defense attorney
and head of the Egyptian Bar Association, had flown to Belgrade,
Yugoslavia, seeking to bring back Khaled.
   Cairo's newspapers said authorities in Yugoslavia, where Khaled
obtained political asylum, were notified through Interpol that he
is a fugitive.
   However, a member of the Nasser family, who spoke today with The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity, said Khaled has no
intention of coming home to face trial. Another family member,
Khaled's brother-in-law Ashraf Marawan, also reportedly said the
defendant refuses to come home.
   Khaled, 38, is one of 11 defendants charged in connection with
four shooting attacks in Cairo between 1984 and 1987 that killed
two Israelis and wounded six Israelis and two Americans.
   Nine other defendants, including Gamal Shawky Abdel Nasser, a
nephew of the late president who also is at large, are charged with
lesser crimes in connection with the alleged conspiracy.
   In announcing the charges last week, government officials said
all defendants except the Nassers were in custody or free on bail.
   Sources close to the fugitives told The Associated Press the two
were advised early in the investigation to leave Egypt, apparently
to avoid the embarrassment to the government of having to arrest
close relatives of a man still adored in much of the Arab world.
   ``Khaled Abdel Nasser's name has been placed on the list of
(people) expected to return to Egyptian airports and ports,''
Al-Akhbar reported.
   It said el-Khawaga, the attorney, hoped to persuade Nasser in
Belgrade to turn himself in to Egyptian authorities. El-Khawaga's
office confirmed the attorney's departure but gave no details.
   Although Egypt and Yugoslavia have no extradition treaty,
Al-Akhbar speculated that Egypt will use diplomatic channels to
extradite Khaled.
   The Nasserite weekly Sawt-el-Arab claimed Sunday that Khaled
said in a telephone conversation from Belgrade that ``I have faith
in the Egyptian judiciary system'' and would return when the trial
begins.
   A trial date has not yet been set.

<TEXT>
   Teen-agers dressed in punk fashions were
among more than 1,000 mourners who packed a church for the funeral
of four family members who police believe were hacked to death with
an ax by a 16-year-old son.
   Two bishops, nine priests and a monsignor presided over a
90-minute Mass Sunday at Pax Christi Catholic Church for Bernard
and Paulette Brom and two of their children, 11-year-old Rick and
14-year-old Diane.
   David Brom, a high school sophomore described as a gentle boy
who wrote poetry but who also favored hard-core punk music, was
charged with murder Friday in the deaths of his parents and younger
brother and sister.
   ``We have no idea what all these things can mean,'' said the
Rev. Syl Brown, Pax Christi's pastor. ``They have left so many
memories,'' he said of the Broms, active members of the church.
   ``We come here with a spirit of absolute loss. We have no idea
what response we can make. But we can see the light their lives has
given us,'' he said.
   The service included readings by classmates of Diane and Rick,
and presentations of symbolic gifts. Among the gifts was a high
school basketball trophy given in memory of Diane, who had been a
cheerleader for her school's basketball team.
   A special section was set aside for teen-agers, including a few
with hair dyed black, gold or purple.
   After the service, about 100 people braved a raw wind at Calvary
Cemetery for the burial. The family's oldest son, Joseph, 19,
appeared stoic at the graveside. Joseph, who did not live with his
family, has asked to be appointed guardian of David.
   Authorities have not yet determined a motive for the slayings.
Sheriff Charles Von Wald has said he understands that David had
argued recently with his father about a music cassette. The Rev.
Jack Krough, chaplain at Rochester Lourdes High School, said
friends had recently heard David muse about wanting to hurt his
family.
   A favorite of David's, according to one friend, is the group
Suicidal Tendencies. A song on their latest album describes ``the
maniac I'll meet. His love for me is like a father to a son. And
now the maniac and I are one.''
   Other friends said the teen-ager was always ready with a joke
and a smile, and ``wouldn't step on a flower.''
   At Lourdes High School, teachers and psychologists are
monitoring David's classmates for signs of depression.
   ``The difficult time is yet to come,'' said Dennis L. Gannon, a
licensed psychologist who interviewed about 50 of David's
classmates.
   Some will sink into depression in 15 to 20 days, he said. Some
will withdraw, while others will become unruly and irritable. Some
will pull out of the depression in a few days, while others may
sink deeper.
   ``Some of them will have a difficult time working this
through,'' Gannon said. ``They'll say things like, `What's the use,
what's the point of going on?'''

   A 5-year-old German shepherd with a

truffle sniffer for 1988, nosing out 14 other dogs.
   Ulmer, one of three entrants belonging to Jerome and Paulette
Tedesco of Cahors, unearthed six hidden truffles in a minute and 22
seconds in Sunday's contest at Grammont outside the southern French
city of Montpellier.
   The Tedescos' other two German shepherds, Oscar and Chico,
finished third and fourth in the 15th annual competition.
   Truffles, an expensive delicacy, are fleshy, potato-shaped fungi
which grow underground near the roots of trees. They are found by
dogs and hogs, which are able to sniff them out.

   Jurors have recommended that a man whose
death sentence was overturned should be resentenced to die, in
spite of character witness testimony by other death row inmates who
described him as generous and caring.
   James Ernest Hitchcock, 31, was convicted and sentenced to death
in 1977 for the rape-murder of his 13-year-old stepniece. The U.S.
Supreme Court overturned his sentence last April.
   After a three-day resentencing trial, jurors voted 7-5 Saturday
to recommend that Hitchcock be executed for the crime.
   Circuit Judge Gary Formet Sr. is not required to follow the
jury's recommendation in his decision, which will be announced
Wednesday.
   Although Hitchcock confessed to the slaying shortly after his
arrest in July 1976, he later recanted and blamed the killing on
his older brother, Richard, who James said had become enraged when
he caught the defendant and victim having sex.
   Hitchcock testified Saturday he confessed to the slaying because
``I thought I was doing the right thing for my brother. ... I loved
him. I covered it up.''
   Richard Hitchcock, 38, denied the accusation last week as he did
11 years ago, when Cynthia Driggers died. He was not charged in his
stepdaughter's death.
   The resentencing jury also heard testimony Friday from eight
convicted killers, who portrayed Hitchcock as a model prisoner, a
peacemaker, teacher and generous person who should be spared from
the electric chair.
   They said Hitchcock taught them to read and write, broke up
fights and loaned them money for tennis shoes and cigarettes.
   ``Ernie doesn't belong there,'' said death row inmate James
Chandler. ``He's trying to help people ... He doesn't need to die.''

<TEXT>
   Veteran actor Jimmy Stewart was honored
with a lifetime achievement award by the Monterey Film Festival at
a dinner that drew a galaxy of stars and a letter from President
Reagan.
   Actor Clint Eastwood, the mayor of nearby Carmel, presented
Stewart with the award Sunday night at the $150-a-plate, black-tie
affair that ended the three-day festival.
   Several of his leading ladies, among them Doris Day and Joan
Fontaine, were on hand as a tribute to Stewart, who turns 80 on May
20.
   Also attending were actresses Katherine Ross and Sue Ann
Langdon, actor Tab Hunter and last year's Film Festival honoree
Cliff Robertson.
   Letters were read from Reagan, a former actor, who said that
Stewart's name on a marquee was ``an iron-clad guarantee of
quality,'' and Gov. George Deukmejian, who said that Stewart
``lifted the spirits of young and old alike.''
   Stewart looked fit during his visit to the Monterey Peninsula,
though he admitted at a news conference Sunday afternoon that he is
having a hard time hearing.
   ``You'd all better speak up,'' he said with a smile.
   Of his career, Stewart said he is grateful he was able to play
so many different roles. ``I had all sorts of parts,'' he said.
``Comedy, westerns, the serious and thought-provoking.''
   Stewart, the star of such classics as ``It's a Wonderful Life''
and ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' was asked what he thought of
computer colorization of his old black and white films.
   ``Colorization is one of the most disgraceful things that ever
happened in any endeavor in this country,'' he said. ``I hope the
people who perpetrate this on others go flat broke someday soon.
   ``The actors end up with orange faces. The cameraman took all
this time, all this time to create depth and to cast the right
shadows. With colorization, people just walk around, just walk
around like painted Easter eggs.''

   Palestinians today held memorial services for
the 61 Arabs killed by Israelis in anti-occupation violence, and
Israel's attorney general ruled soldiers could not use force to
punish or humiliate protesters.
   Also today, hospital officials said a 14-year-old Arab boy was
wounded in the thigh in the Gaza Strip.
   The army reported an Arab was arrested after trying to attack an
Israeli soldier with a knife in the West Bank town of Ramallah. It
was the third such attack on soldiers in four days.
   Leaflets distributed by underground Palestinian groups in the
occupied territories called for demonstrations this week _
beginning with memorial services on ``Martyrs Day'' today _ to
protest the visit to Israel by Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   Army officials said the five-day visit, scheduled to start
Thursday, might prompt an escalation in violence in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. ``It's not organized or systematic, but outside
events like the Shultz visit do affect the situation,'' an army
spokeswoman said. She spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Attorney General Yosef Harish sent a letter to Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin saying soldiers may not use force as a means of
punishment or humiliation, Israel radio reported.
   Orders that call for such use of force are illegal, ruled
Harish, who demanded Rabin issue appropriate instructions to the
troops. Harish said many Palestinians have complained to him about
abuse by soldiers.
   In an army survey, 65 percent of soldiers questioned said they
had witnessed rough treatment of Palestinians by troops, said the
army's chief psychologist, Col. Shlomo Dover. The radio did not say
how many soldiers were questioned.
   Dover said 70 percent felt angry and frustrated by the situation
in the occupied lands and said they thought using the army to break
up civilian protests damages its effectiveness to fight a war.
   Dover told Israel radio that 92 percent of the soldiers
questioned expressed full trust in their commanders.
   ``We don't have problems with the motivation of soliders ... not
that they rejoice to do it, but it's an assignment that has been
given to the army and that's how it is seen by the soldiers,'' he
said.
   Since the wave of protests began Dec. 8 in the territories
Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East War, Israelis have killed 61
Palestinians. The latest fatalities were two men shot and killed by
soldiers Sunday.
   The government has spent $330 million, or 1 percent of the
government's 1988 budget, in an attempt to quell the violence.
   In one memorial services today, women marched to a cemetery in
the West Bank village of Anabta to honor three residents who died
in clashes with the army earlier this month.
   A Molotov cocktail was thrown at an Israeli car in the West Bank
town of Ramallah, but no one was injured, the army said.
   In the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Jabaliya, soldiers clashed
with protesters, and a 14-year-old boy was shot in the thigh,
doctors at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital said.
   In Gaza City, anti-American slogans painted in red on closed
store shutters read: ``No to the Shultz visit. Yes to the
Palestinian government. Yes to the PLO.''
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has ordered Palestinians
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip not to meet with Shultz, saying he
is pro-Israeli and has rejected minimal Palestinian demands.
   But local Palestinian leaders said today that they were trying
to persuade PLO chief Yasser Arafat to lift the ban. U.S. officials
met with several Palestinian representatives over the weekend to
discuss the Shultz visit.
   During his visit, Shultz will present to Israeli leaders a U.S.
peace initiative calling for an international forum for direct
talks on Palestinian self-rule and negotiations on a final
settlement by December.
   But Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told European Jewish leaders
Sunday night he objected to the hurried pace: ``Any attempt to
force the pace and shorten the period (of self-rule) would be a
detriment to the very essence of the agreement.''
   He also indicated he would not give in to pressure to accept the
American plan: ``When the time comes for decisions, we shall decide
on the basis of what is in our national interests.''

<HEAD>Authorities Find Body In Trailer, Relatives Say `God Dealing With
Him'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REFORM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relatives of a man whose decomposed body was
found about three weeks after his death apparently were convinced
that he was still alive, officials said.
   ``I understand they were seeing a voodoo man,'' Pickens County
Coroner Herbert Latham said of the deceased man and his relatives.
   Pickens County Sheriff David Abston identified the dead man as
Jessie James Latham, 42, not related to the coroner.
   The body was discovered in a bedroom in a mobile home Wednesday
by county health workers, authorities said. The coroner said the
man had been dead about three weeks.
   ``He was pretty well decomposed at the time and the odor all
around the trailer was pretty strong,'' Abston said. ``Some of the
kids playing in the yard were wearing face masks, like in an
operating room.''
   The coroner said the dead man's relatives ``tried to convince me
that he was still alive, that God was dealing with him, that he was
fine.''
   ``This was a weird case,'' he said Sunday, a day after the body
was buried.
   The coroner said that although no foul play was suspected, he
was awaiting hospital records from New York, where Latham had
received some treatment, before announcing the cause of death.
   The coroner said Latham apparently was aware he was suffering
from a fatal disease. The autopsy did not reveal the exact disease,
he said.
   Abston said Latham returned to Alabama recently from New York,
and was picked up at the Tuscaloosa Airport by his sister,
Catherine Latham, who took him to a motel in Reform. The two stayed
there for two weeks.
   Dilip Bhakta, the motel manager, said he never saw Latham, but
asked Latham's sister to leave the motel Feb. 2 ``because of the
smell.''
   ``She never would let anyone come in the room and would meet our
maids at the door to get materials,'' Bhakta said.
   Bhakta said the odor ``was very strong, very offensive'' and
that there were several complaints from other guests.
   Ms. Latham said she took her brother to a man in Hale County who
told him to drink goat's milk with some pills he gave him. She said
she took her brother to the mobile home on Feb. 2.
   The nine occupants of the trailer included two infants and
several teen-agers, the coroner said.
   Ms. Latham dismissed the claim that her brother was treated by a
``voodoo doctor.''
   Abston said she told him that her brother was alive when he was
moved and did not die until the day authorities found his body.
   L.C. Keasler, director of the Pickens County Department of Human
Resources, said agency workers went to the trailer Feb. 14 after an
anonymous tip, but were refused entrance. The agency workers
returned Wednesday with police.
   Asked if any supernatural elements or voodoo were involved in
Latham's treatment, his sister told The Tuscaloosa News on
Saturday: ``I don't like to use that word. I'm not working for the
devil _ I work for God.
   ``All I could do was minister to him. He's in God's hands now.''

<TEXT>
   Now that the New York Post has been saved,
readers and employees wonder what the nation's oldest continuously
published newspaper will look like under the new owner, and whether
he'll stop its money-losing ways.
   Peter Kalikow, who is buying the tabloid from Rupert Murdoch for
$37.6 million, spent Sunday talking with advisers about what
direction to take the Post.
   The paper's 10 unions agreed Saturday to $22 million in
concessions that Murdoch and Kalikow said were necessary to keep
the paper alive. That includes eliminating 130 of the Post's 1,200
jobs.
   Kalikow is widely thought to want to back away from the paper's
emphasis on stories of sex, crime and scandal.
   It will remain a tabloid, but ``there will be a change in
format,'' said his spokesman, Howard Rubenstein. ``There'll be
changes in headlines, in the front page, in the emphasis of the
paper.''
   But, Rubenstein added, Kalikow ``still wants it to be feisty and
provocative.''
   Murdoch bought the paper in 1976 and fashioned it after the
British tabloids. Soon readers were seeing such headlines as
``HEADLESS BODY IN TOPLESS BAR,'' which ran above a story about a
homicide in a tavern.
   They saw a photo of Prince Rainier of Monaco looking into, and
making an obscene hand gesture at, a Post photographer's lens. The
caption read: ``THE PRINCE GIVES US THE FINGER.''
   And then there was the story about Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi's reported psychological problems, featuring a photograph
doctored to show readers what he would look like dressed as a
woman, complete with lipstick and earrings.
   Kalikow, a real estate developer and businessman worth an
estimated $500 million, has approved a $2 million promotional
campaign for the newspaper, said Rubenstein.
   According to his agreement with Murdoch, Kalikow promised to
keep the Post in operation for at least one year after he takes
over March 7.
   The Post lost about $17 million before taxes last year, and
about a quarter of its advertising in the last few months. Its
circulation has dropped from 700,000 to 500,000, partly because of
a retrenchment in areas outside metropolitan New York.
   A $1 million marketing study commissioned by Kalikow ``shows the
paper already appeals to a fairly well-to-do audience,'' Rubenstein
said.

   A pro-Iranian extremist group today
released a videotaped message from a kidnapped U.S. Marine colonel
calling on President Reagan to meet his captors' demands.
   The 70-second tape from the Organization of the Oppressed on
Earth was accompanied by a typewritten Arabic statement reiterating
the group's claim that the hostage, Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, is
a CIA agent.
   The Arabic statement also warned Lebanon's mainstream Shiite
Moslem militia, Amal, to stop searching for Higgins, 43, of
Danville, Ky., who was abducted Wednesday near the southern port
city of Tyre.
   Amal, which continued its search today, has taken into custody
dozens of members of Hezbollah, Lebanon's most radical Shiite
group. Hezbollah, which is believed to be the umbrella organization
for pro-Iranian groups holding most of the 24 foreign hostages in
Lebanon, on Sunday declared support for Higgins' captors.
   Hezbollah and Amal militimen clashed in a brief firefight
Sunday. No casualties were reported in the half-hour shootout in
the southeastern village of Ein el-Tineh.
   In the videotape delivered today to a Western news agency in
Beirut, an unshaven Higgins appears to be reading from a statement.
The statement by Higgins says Reagan ``has to take responsibility
for the crimes he has committed against the oppressed people in the
region.''
   In the statement, Higgins then lists the same demands his
captors made when they first claimed his abduction Friday in a
statement that called the colonel a CIA spy. U.S. and U.N.
officials denied the spying charge.
   The demands, as given by Higgins, are:
   _Israel's withdrawal from the self-proclaimed security zone it
carved out in southern Lebanon when the bulk of its army withdrew
from Lebanon in 1985, ending a three-year invasion.
   _The release of all detained Lebanese and Palestinian
``mujahedeen,'' or holy warriors, from the Khiam detention camp in
the security zone and in Israeli jails. An estimated 300 detainees
are believed held at Khiam.
   _An end to what they call U.S. intervention in Lebanon and to
U.S. diplomatic missions to the Middle East.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz is to travel to the region
this week to present a peace plan aimed at ending 10 weeks of
rioting by Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The statement accompanying the videotape calls on Justice
Minister Nabih Berri's Amal militia to call off its search for
Higgins in southern Lebanon.
   ``We call on our brethren in Amal to understand the dangerous
espionage role Higgins was carrying out, profiting from the U.N.
observer role,'' the statement says. In an earlier statement given
to a Beirut newspaper, the group said it was ``lying in wait for
any other suspicious American.''
   A decorated Vietnam veteran and one-time assistant to former
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger, Higgins heads a 76-man
observer group attached to a U.N. peacekeeping force in south
Lebanon.
   His abduction has stirred tension between Amal and Hezbollah,
which has been challenging Amal's dominance in southern Lebanon.
   Amal has rejected the kidnappers' charge that Higgins is a spy,
saying in a statement that most abductions by extremist Shiite
factions in Lebanon were motivated by a desire to extract ransoms.
   In Washington, Reagan on Sunday night said, ``We're doing
everything we can and exploring every avenue'' to free Higgins.
   Higgins' abduction prompted the U.N.'s Interim Forces In
Lebanon, or UNIFIL, to withdraw 20 observers to its headquarters in
Naqoura, near the Israel-Lebanon border, said Timor Goksel,
spokesman for UNIFIL.
   The rest of the observer group, which is required to be unarmed,
remained Sunday in positions overlooking Beirut's green line, which
divides the city into Moslem and Christian sectors, he said.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization meanwhile declared it was
working for Higgins' release.
   In an interview today in Tunisia, PLO leader Yasser Arafat said
he had given instructions to his colleagues in Lebanon to contact
the kidnappers.
   ``In general I can say it was one of the fanatic Lebanese
groups'' that was responsible for the abduction, he said on
CBS-TV's ``This Morning.''
   Higgins was the third U.N. official abducted in south Lebanon in
three weeks. Jan Stening, 44, of Sweden and Willian Jorgensen, 58,
of Norway, both employees of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency that
cares for Palestinian refugees, were kidnapped Feb. 5 about 25
miles north of Tyre.
   There are 22 other foreigners missing in Lebanon, including
eight Americans, four Frenchmen, three Britons, two West Germans,
an Irishman, an Italian, an Indian and two unidentified men.
   The longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<HEAD>Poll Measures Parents's Reaction To AIDS Victims At School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EMMAUS, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least a fifth of the nation's parents
would refuse to send their children to school if a classmate
contracted AIDS, according to a survey by Louis Harris and
Associates.
   The poll, conducted for Children magazine, also found more than
half of the parents would want to know the identity of young AIDS
victims in their community, and all but 6 percent believe schools
should educate youngsters about the deadly disease.
   The pollsters surveyed 411 parents with children 3 to 18 years
old between Oct. 23 and Oct. 25. The survey has a margin of error
of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   According to the poll, 21 percent of parents would keep their
children home if a classmate contracted acquired immune defeciency
syndrome; 66 percent would allow their youngsters to continue
attending classes; and 12 percent were uncertain or would need to
weigh the circumstances to decide.
   Experts with the federal Centers for Disease Control insist AIDS
is not transmitted through casual contact but through sex,
contaminated blood products and tainted hypodermic needles, and
infected pregnant women can give it to their fetus.
   But a few cases, including a child in Pennsylvania's rural
Monroe County, have no easily explained source for the virus, which
destroys the body's ability to fight infection.
   ``Scientifically, you could not make the statement that it would
be impossible to contact AIDS from casual contact with a
classmate,'' said Lester Lave, a professor of economics at
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh and past president of the
Society of Risk Analysis.
   ``But it seems extremely unlikely. We lose kids every year in
school bus accidents. We haven't lost any kids from a casual
contact with AIDS,'' he said.
   The survey also found that 56 percent would want to know the
identity of AIDS victims enrolled in school, while 39 percent
believe the information should remain confidential, as required by
federal law.
   Parents believe the special nature of the disease requires
extraordinary steps on the part of school districts.
   According to the survey, 94 percent of the parents say schools
need to educate teachers and students about the disease, even if no
one in the district has contracted AIDS.
   ``I think that's a virtual mandate for schools to get
information out for teachers and students to understand,'' said
Michael R. Kagay, vice president of the Harris organization.
   Currently, 17 states require AIDS education in public schools.
   The figures from various parts of the country differ.
   In the West, 74 percent of the parents would allow their
children to attend school with an AIDS victim; in the Midwest, the
figure is 70 percent; and in the East the percentage drops to 60
percent.
   Kagay believes the concentration of the disease in large cities,
particularly on the East Coast, accounts for the difference.
   ``What you are seeing here is the nearness of the threat,''
Kagay said. ``So the stronger the threat or the closer to home, the
more reluctant parents may be to send their kids to school.''
   Official estimates of the number of children with AIDS vary from
300 to 500, according to the magazine. But Dr. James Oleske of
Children's Hospital in New Jersey in Newark believes up to 3,000
children now carry the virus and half suffer from the disease.

   Official corruption linked to the drug trade
is spreading around Latin America, giving an anxious edge to
longstanding predictions the illegal traffic could damage the
region's political stability.
   Because the people who produce and deal in cocaine, marijuana
and heroin are so wealthy, the law enforcement agencies entrusted
with the fight against them are often outmatched.
   Indeed, Bolivian President Victor Paz Estenssoro estimates
cocaine brings in $600 million each year to his nation, compared to
$500 million for all legal exports combined.
   In that impoverished South American country alone, about 400,000
farmers, merchants and others depend directly or indirectly on coca
leaf farming and cocaine for their livelihood.
   Allegations that the drug trade is providing funds for
candidates has become an issue in this year's election in
Venezuela. An outburst of drug-related violence in Colombia has led
to calls for the government to be given special powers to combat it.
   Bolivia, Colombia and Mexico have for some time been known as
notorious centers of drug production and trafficking.
   But in recent months, cases and allegations of officials playing
an integral role in the drug trade have emerged in once overlooked
countries _ Honduras, Haiti and Panama.
   And after a period of relative calm, drug cases proceeding in
the U.S. judicial system are once again having a major impact on
relations between Washington and many Latin American nations.
   ``Unfortunately, much the United States does these days becomes
buried in ideological rhetoric which has nothing whatever to do
with the issue at hand,'' said a recent editorial in the Daily
Nation, the largest newspaper in the Caribbean island nation of
Barbados.
   Traditionally, the response from governments and observers in
the region is to call for the United States to look more closely at
how to control American drug consumers, whose dollars provide the
basic incentive for the trade.
   In a recent editorial, the Mexican government news agency
Notimex said the money floated in the drug trade approximates the
total amount of debt service payments made by Latin American
countries each year _ something in the neighborhood of $47 billion.
   ``That figure shows the economic magnitude that the networks of
narcotics trafficking have, and the use of planes, ships, weapons
and a great deal of money to bribe officials and judicial
authorities,'' the editorial said. ``However, the principal problem
is the enormous consumption of drugs that exists in the United
States, and that reaches $110 billion.''
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, chief of the Defense Forces of
Panama and the power behind his country's nominally civilian
government, was named in two Florida indictments Feb. 5 for
racketeering and other drug-related charges.
   Allegations of his involvement in a wide range of illicit
activities, including drug trafficking and money laundering, have
played a role in protests against his rule that began in June.
   In retaliation for the steady attacks from Washington, Noriega's
supporters have called for the ouster of the Southern Command,
headquarters for all U.S. military activities in Latin America.
   The Pentagon, meanwhile, has described as ``isolated cases'' the
recent discovery of two cocaine shipments aboard U.S. military
aircraft based in Panama, saying they did not appear linked to
official corruption in that country.
   In Honduras, a key U.S. ally in Central America, the government
and armed forces have responded with indignation to newspaper
accounts alleging links between the military and drug traffickers.
   ``I am free of any guilt,'' Gen. Humberto Regalado Hernandez,
chief of the Honduran armed forces, said in a telephone interview.
``I will not deceive my own people.''
   Haitian Col. Jean-Claude Paul, who runs an army unit known as
his country's most brutal, was named by a Miami businessman as
Haiti's main cocaine trafficker. The businessman, Osvaldo Quintana,
told reporters he also knew of involvement by higher Haitian
officials.
   Testimony at the trial of reputed Colombian drug kingpin Carlos
Lehder Rivas in Jacksonville, Fla., has implicated Prime Minister
Lynden O. Pindling of the Bahamas.
   Nine Mexicans were indicted in January in Los Angeles in the
1985 kidnap-murder of American drug agent Enrique Camarena Salazar,
while a San Diego case a week later named seven Mexicans among 12
foreign nationals said to be behind a major cocaine ring.
   ``We insist that it will not be possible to defeat international
drug trafficking unless production, distribution and consumption
are attacked with similar strength and effectiveness,'' President
Miguel de la Madrid said at his Feb. 13 meeting with President
Reagan. ``This final link (consumption in the United States)
continues to have a determining influence in the criminal chain.''
   ``It looks like (U.S. officials) are taking the problem
seriously but they're not,'' Bayardo Ramirez Monagas, president of
Venezuela's National Commission on Drug Abuse, said in an
interview. ``The problem is not production or consumption, but the
financing.''

   He didn't win the 6.0 scores that signal
an absolutely flawless program. But to figure skater Brian Boitano,
his gold medal-winning performance at the Olympics was the ultimate
``10.''
   ``This time, it was perfect,'' the 24-year-old Californian said
one day after he defeated friend and rival Brian Orser of Canada to
become the only U.S. Olympic gold medalist. The United States' only
other medals have been a bronze in the figure skating pairs and a
silver in 1,500 meter speed skating.
   ``For the first time in my life it looked better than it felt,''
Boitano told a news conference Sunday, after watching a video of
his triumphant performance. ``I'm usually so critical of myself
that I thought I'd see things I'd done wrong.
   ``Instead ... it was the first time I could say the jumps were
the best I've done and I could say, `Hey, what a good program.'
It's something you build for for years and when it happens ... it's
the ultimate.''
   Saturday night's dramatic ``Battle of the Brians'' capped 10
years of skating rivalry that saw Boitano lose the last two
meetings, at Skate Canada last fall and at the 1987 World
Championships. Each man selected his own military music and battle
colors _ blue for Boitano, red for Orser.
   Boitano, from the solemn opening notes from Carmine Coppola's
``Napoleon'' to the final seconds when he thrust his fist in the
air and wiped away a tear of elation, shone throughout.
   The four-time American titlist was first with five of the nine
judges, to Orser's four. Although they tied in points, the judges
gave Boitano the victory on better technical marks.
   Writing about his future for USA Today newspaper, Boitano said:
``It's kind of scary because you know your life is going to change,
and you don't know if you're ready for it or if you want it to
change.''
   Money, from commercial endorsements or other appearances, was
not the reason behind his drive to win the gold, he wrote for
today's edition. ``I'm sure I'll do some things with it, but it's
not why I treasure it.''
   ``It's going to be different when I go home. It's kind of scary
thinking about what it's going to be like when I get back to San
Francisco, wondering if I'll be able to slip in and out everywhere
without being recognized. I worry about privacy, about always being
on show. `Brain Boitano seen drinking a wine,''' he said.

   A British soldier was arrested
today after he fatally shot a civilian in the back as the man
walked to a football match, the army said.
   The army said the soldier was in an observation tower Sunday at
a permanent military checkpoint a half-mile from the Irish border.
   From the tower he took a shot at the man, Aidan McAnespie, who
was walking to a weekly Gaelic football game in the village of
Aughnacloy, County Tyrone.
   The 23-year-old died on the road before medical aid or a priest
could reach him, police said.
   Police said the soldier was arrested and was being interrogated.
Villagers said McAnespie belonged to the Roman Catholic minority in
the British-ruled, Protestant-majority province.
   The army said it ``deeply regrets'' the incident. It gave no
other information and did not identify the soldier.
   ``It was cold-blooded murder _ I saw McAnespie shot in the
back,'' said Anthony McGonnell, a councilman.
   Francis Molloy, another councilman, said McAnespie was an
election worker for Sinn Fein, political arm of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army fighting British rule.
   Molloy said McAnespie claimed to have been repeatedly harassed
and threatened by the security forces.
   ``He said he was afraid the security forces would carry out
their threats,'' Molloy said.
   The shooting further strained relations between Britain and the
Irish Republic government in Dublin. Dublin called immediately for
details of the killing.
   The Irish government, which regards itself as responsible for
the Catholic minority in the north, has been angered by two recent
developments.
   The British Court of Appeal recently upheld the convictions of
six Irishmen jailed for life for two bombings that killed 21 people
on the British mainland in 1974. The Irish Republican Army claimed
responsibility for the blasts.
   Britain also decided not to prosecute any Northern Ireland
police officers connected with the police shootings of six unarmed
Catholics in an alleged ``shoot-to-kill'' policy against guerrilla
suspects.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the province with the Irish Republic, which is predominantly
Roman Catholic.

   Fidel Castro, in an interview published today,
flatly denied presidential aspirant Pat Robertson's charge that the
Soviet Union has nuclear missiles in Cuba.
   In the interview, published in USA Today, Castro told the
newspaper's chairman, Allen H. Neuharth, that there ``is not even a
semblance of a Soviet missile in Cuba. Not one. I repeat, not one.''
   He also said in the weekend interview, conducted in Havana, that
talk of such missiles is ``insane.''
   Castro was asked about Robertson's recent assertions that 25
intermediate-range Soviet SS-4 and SS-5 missiles, armed with
nuclear warheads, have been stationed in Cuba. The White House
subsequently said it had ``no indication'' of any nuclear weapons
being in Cuba.
   Indeed, Castro said in the interview, ``With your sophisticated
satellite spying, you know when a cat is walking on the roof of a
house in Cuba.''
   Talk of Cuba's posing a military threat to the United States, he
said, is a ``Walt Disney fantasy.''

   Rescuers struggled in the rain
early today to find survivors in the rubble of a collapsed
apartment building in Rio, where three days of mudslides and flash
floods have killed at least 80 people.
   Mayor Roberto Saturnino Braga said the mud, water and debris
made the city look like ``a giant stepped through'' the area.
   Officials said the flooding, the worst in the city's history,
had rendered homeless at least 11,000 of Rio's 5.6 million
residents, washing ramshackle homes down steep slopes and turning
streets into raging torrents.
   Throughout the city, army trucks and volunteers helped transport
evacuated dwellers of precarious hillside shantytowns to temporary
shelters in schools, churches and public buildings.
   Citizens throughout the nation, prompted by all-night appeals on
three commercial TV networks, donated truckloads of medicine, food,
clothing and building supplies to the victims.
   Using sledgehammers and chain saws, drenched firefighters worked
frantically early today to pull people out of the concrete remains
of a three-story, six-apartment building in the Abolicao district.
   The dwelling was hit by a mudslide Sunday night that killed at
least 11 inhabitants in an avalanche of concrete and plaster.
   By Sunday night, 9.6 inches of rain had fallen on the city since
Friday, when the flooding began.
   Braga postponed the post-Carnival reopening of schools and asked
private employers to give their workers today off, saying the city
could not handle a normal flux of traffic.
   Health Secretary Jose Noronha warned there might be an outbreak
of leptospirosis, a group of sometimes fatal diseases that can
cause fever, vomiting, anemia and bleeding of the skin and mucous
membranes. Leptospirosis is best known as Weill's or Swineherd's
disease and is spread from animals to man. Noronha told residents
to boil drinking water and said the government would vaccinate for
typhoid and tetanus.
   The building that collapsed in Abolicao was in a
lower-middle-class area. But most victims of the storms were poor
people who had lived in shacks built on the city's steep
mountainsides.
   Water, mud and boulders washed many such shacks down the steep
slopes and turned streets below into raging torrents and even
lagoons.
   ``I can't even imagine what will happen to this city if the
rains continue,'' said Vice Mayor Jo Rezende. ``The situation is
desperate. We estimate 50,000 people will have to be given new
housing in safer areas.''
   At the collapsed building in Abolicao, rescue workers trudged
through knee-deep mud and rubble searching for victims. At least 13
people were rescued.
   In another district, rescue workers were forced to temporarily
abandon their search for elderly patients and hospital staff killed
when a mudslide wiped out a three-floor wing of the Santa Genoveva
Hillside Clinic.
   Although 350 mostly older patients were in the hospital when the
slide occurred Saturday, civil defense officials said only about 30
were missing.
   In the same district Santa Teresa, an eight-floor apartment
building threatened to topple and was evacuated, engineers said.
   Although the hillside slums that are home to about 2 million
people were hardest hit, wealthy areas also suffered serious
damage. Evacuations were ordered after flooding hit the wealthy
Gavea, Lagoa and Jardim Botanico districts.
   Torrents raged down streets, prompting some people to tie their
cars to posts to prevent them from being swept away. Civil defense
workers used amphibious vehicles and surfboards to reach people in
partially submerged cars.
   Meteorologists said the downpour, caused by an Antarctic cold
front, was likely to continue through today.
   Earlier this month, 207 people died in flooding and mudslides
around the state and 13,000 were left homeless. The worst-hit area
was Petropolis, a mountain resort town 40 miles north of Rio.

<TEXT>
   A baby born with nearly no brain was
on life-support equipment today as a potential organ donor, after a
similar infant was taken off life support machinery, officials said.
   Both newborns, born with the birth defect known as anencephaly,
or severely underdeveloped brains, were part of a controversial
program at Loma Linda University Medical Center preserving
brain-dead anencephalic infants for use as organ donors.
   The practice has drawn fire from right-to-life groups charging
cruelty, and from medical ethicists, who say it is questionable to
keep the babies on life support when they have no chance at
long-term survival.
   Evelyn Keys, born Saturday in San Antonio, Texas, was flown to
Loma Linda that night to be used in the donor program.
   She arrived just hours after a child identified only as Baby
John was taken off life support when a worldwide search failed to
turn up any needy organ recipients matching his tissue type, said
hospital spokeswoman Anita Rockwell.
   But one of the infant's heart valves was removed and stored for
later use, Ms. Rockwell said.
   Anencephalic babies usually die shortly after birth, and Loma
Linda, where infant heart transplants have become routine, wants to
establish a practice of sustaining such babies so their organs can
be transplanted after brain death is certified by two independent
physicians.
   Hospital officials said removal of Baby John's heart valve was
the first use of body parts from a U.S. anencephalic infant. Loma
Linda previously transplanted the heart from an anencephalic baby
declared brain-dead in Canada.
   Baby Evelyn was born to Judy Keys, 22, and Airman Todd Keys, 21,
of the 6993rd Electronic Security Squad at Lackland Air Force Base.
   ``Doctors report Baby Evelyn is resting comfortably, and
although there are some signs of brain stem deterioration, she has
not yet met all the criteria of brain death,'' Ms. Rockwell said
today.
   Loma Linda is the first hospital in the United States to develop
a medical program allowing the practice of sustaining anencephalic
infants for transplants.
   If brain death does not occur within a week of birth, an
anencephalic baby will be removed from its respirator and allowed
to die naturally.
   Several thousand anencephalic babies are born in the United
States each year. Their brain stems can sustain basic functions
such as breathing for a short time, but death usually occurs within
hours or days of birth.
   Loma Linda has specialized in infant heart transplants, with 13
babies under the age of four months given new hearts at the
hospital. Nine have survived.
   The center, 65 miles east of Los Angeles, became well known in
1984 when Dr. Leonard Bailey unsuccessfully transplanted the heart
of a baboon into an infant known as Baby Fae.

<HEAD>Six European Relief Workers Released After Being Abducted In
Ethiopia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six European relief workers who were
abducted by rebels in Ethiopia have been released, a medical aid
official said today.
   Three Irishwomen, two Belgians and a Dutchman were set free
after being kidnapped by the Popular Front for the Liberation of
the Tigre last Thursday, said an official of the medical relief
group Medicins Sans Frontieres-Belgium.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no
details were available and did not specify when the relief workers
were freed.
   Earlier today, Seyoum Musse, head of foreign relations for the
London office of the rebel group said the six were in good
condition.
   ``The whole aim of taking them with us was to show there are
millions of people who are beyond the reach of ... isolated
symbolic (government) food distribution centers like the one they
were stationed at,'' Musse said in a telephone interview.
   ``The aim is to dispel the government's misinformation that
millions are being reached with aid,'' he said, denying that the
group's action was an abduction.
   ``The government will not allow these workers to go outside the
place they work. For this reason we have taken them a few hours
away,'' he said. ``They are the guests of millions of starved
people.''
   The rebels abducted two Belgian doctors and a Dutch nurse of the
international aid group along with two Irish nuns and an Irish
doctor from their base in Idaga Hamous in Tigre, about 340 miles
north of the capital Addis Ababa, the medical group reported Sunday.
   Medicins San Frontieres is an international non-governmental
organization that has medical aid projects in 15 countries in
Central America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia.
   A spokesman for the doctors group initially said the relief
workers may have been abducted to treat rebel wounded. Fighting in
the northern province has been intense between the secessionist
rebels and the government of Lt. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam.
   Musse denied that the workers had been taken to treat wounded.
   ``We have our own doctors,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.S. Warship Fires Warning Shots At Fishing Boats</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with eight grafs to UPDATE with U.S. statement on
warning shots; picks up 7th graf pvs: U.S. officials...</NOTE>

<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. warship making its maiden voyage
on the Persian Gulf fired warning shots today at a pair of fishing
boats that crew members initially believed were attack vessels.
   A U.S. military official, asking not to be identified, said the
landing-dock ship Trenton took the action ``after it observed two
apparent Boghammar-type boats coming toward it,'' about 30 miles
off the coast of Dubai.
   He said the Trenton issued two verbal warnings, which were
ignored, and as the boats approached to within 3,300 yards ``it
fired a flare and bursts of .50-caliber machine-gun fire, at which
time the craft stopped, then veered off toward the northeast.
   ``A helicopter sent up from the frigate John A. Moore later
confirmed through observation that both were fishing boats and
neither was hit or damaged,'' the official added.
   He said the boats at first appeared to resemble the fast,
Swedish-built Boghammar Marin boats frequently used by Iran's
Revolutionary Guards to attack commercial ships in the Gulf.
   U.S. warships in the past have fired warning shots to keep
unidentified small boats and Iraqi aircraft from approaching too
close to convoys escorted by the navy.
   The 17,000-ton Trenton had just arrived in the gulf hours
earlier carrying about 400 U.S. Marines and a contingent of Marine
attack helicopters.
   It was accompanied by the missile frigate John A. Moore and the
Gus W. Darnell, a 39,000-ton oiler chartered by the U.S. Military
Sealift Command. The Darnell makes periodic trips into the Gulf to
pick up fuel oil for U.S. warships.
   U.S. officials said that because the group included no Kuwaiti
tankers or other commercial vessels under the U.S. flag, it would
not be counted as a gulf ``transit.'' The Navy has conducted 35
escorted convoys since last July and the next one is expected to
leave Kuwait in the next few days.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. gulf operation will get a new commander this
week, a 50-year-old career aviator who once headed the Blue Angels,
the Navy's elite acrobatic jet team.
   Rear Adm. Anthony A. Less, will become commanding officer of the
Navy's Middle East Force in ceremonies Saturday aboard a new
flagship, USS Coronado. The Salem, Ohio, native replaces Rear Adm.
Harold J. Bernsen.
   As commander of the force since July 1986, Bernsen oversaw last
year's buildup that followed President Reagan's decision to
re-register 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers under the American flag to
protect them from attacks by Iran.
   Under Bernsen, the force nearly tripled in size, from about six
to 17 warships. It was recently cut back to 16.
   The United States has been escorting Kuwaiti vessels since last
summer. The only mishap occurred during the first convoy when the
supertanker Bridgeton struck a mine, believed laid by Iran, on July
24. Since then, the Navy has escorted 34 other convoys without a
hitch.
   Iranian ships frequently stop and search vessels they suspect of
carrying cargo for Iraq. Iran also attacks neutral ships in
retaliation for Iraqi air raids on Iran's oil shipping in the gulf.
The two nations have been at war for 7{ years.
   The last such raid claimed by Iraq was last Tuesday, and no ship
attacks by Iran have been reported since Feb. 11.
   Less takes over a command being drastically reshaped for the
second time in the past several months.
   On Feb. 3 he relieved Rear Adm. Dennis Brooks as commander of
the Joint Task Force Middle East, a shipboard headquarters created
last year to improve coordination between the gulf-based ships and
two supporting battle groups in the Arabian Sea.
   Well-informed Navy officers, speaking on condition of anonymity,
say the system failed because of operational conflicts between the
gulf and task force commanders.
   Although the Middle East Force is a surface unit, U.S. law
requires any ship with extensive air capability, such as the
16,912-ton Coronado and the 15,000-ton La Salle, which it replaces,
to be commanded by an aviator.
   Less flew A-7 Corsair attack bombers from the carrier Kitty Hawk
during the Vietnam War and in 1973 became the first commanding
officer of the Blue Angels when the flight demonstration team was
formally made a squadron. He served as its commander and flight
leader for three years.
   Less later commanded the oil tanker Wichita and the attack
carrier Ranger, operating in the western Pacific and the Indian
Ocean with the U.S. Seventh Fleet. Since last August, he had
commanded a carrier group and battle group.
   Bernsen, a Boston native, and specialist in aerial electronic
surveillance, served five tours aboard the carrier Forrestal in the
Mediterranean. He was commanding officer of the La Salle _ later
his own flagship _ during the 1979 U.S. hostage crisis in Iran and
the start of the Iraq-Iran war in 1980.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Explosions apparently caused by firebombs rocked a
nursery school and a morgue early today in Paris, causing extensive
damage but no injuries, firefighters reported.
   A previously unknown group called Committee of International
Revolutionary Solidarity claimed responsibility for the morgue
explosion, radio station RTL reported. The explosions came on the
day that a trial of seven alleged French terrorists began.
   Police said the explosion at the morgue, called Medical-Legal
Institute, occurred at about 5:30 a.m. A guardian and his family
who live at the institute were awakened by the blast but not hurt.
   About half an hour later and a mile to the northeast, a second
blast hit the ground floor of the Wake-up School, a private nursery
school in the lower middle-class Charonne district east of the
Bastille.
   No one was at the school.
   Fires at both locations were rapidly brought under control by
firefighters.
   There was no immediate report of a claim of responsibility for
the second explosion, and no indication why the nursery school or
the morgue might have been chosen as targets.
   Police refused to confirm that leaflets, claiming responsibility
for the blast, had been found at the morgue.
   The radio station quoted the leaflets as saying ``although we
are not sympathizers of Direct Action, we are against the state as
arms dealer and a society that profits from death.''
   Direct Action, the best-known extreme left terrorist group in
France, was effectively dismantled by a series of arrests last year.
   The fourth trial this month of Direct Action members opened this
afternoon, with seven people charged in the 1983 robberies of a
jewelry store and a bank.
   Jean-Marc Rouillan, one of four leaders of the group who have
been on a hunger strike for 84 days but kept alive with
transfusions, is among the seven defendants.

   Palestinians held memorial services today for
the 61 Arabs killed by Israelis troops, and Israel's attorney
general ruled soldiers could not use force to punish or humiliate
protesters.
   Two Palestinians were wounded in clashes with soldiers in the
West Bank city of Ramallah and the Gaza Strip refugee camp
Jabaliya, hospital officials said.
   In the Gaza Strip city Khan Yunis, an Israeli civilian fired in
the air after his car was stoned by protesters, an Arab reporter
said.
   The army said it was checking both reports. It also said an Arab
was arrested after trying to stab an Israeli soldier in Ramallah,
the third such attack in four days.
   Leaflets distributed in the occupied territories declared a
``Martyrs' Day'' today and called for demonstrations and a strike
this week to protest the visit to Israel by U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz.
   Army officials said the five-day Shultz visit, scheduled to
begin Thursday, might prompt an escalation of violence.
   ``It's not organized or systematic, but outside events like the
Shultz visit do affect the situation,'' an army spokeswoman said on
condition of anonymity.
   Jerusalem Police spokesman Rafi Levy said 1,500 additional
officers brought in from other areas had been deployed in the holy
city to curb Arab violence.
   Israeli troops entered the Arab neighborhood of Silwan at the
foot of the Mount of Olives and cleared away makeshit barricades,
while national police went door-to-door checking identifications
and looking for agitators.
   Attorney General Yosef Harish sent a letter to Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin saying soldiers may not use force as a means of
punishment or humiliation, said Justice Ministry spokeswoman Etty
Eshed.
   Orders that call for such use of force are illegal, ruled
Harish, who demanded Rabin issue appropriate instructions to the
troops.
   Ms. Eshed said Harish decided to take action after many
Palestinians complained to him about abuse by soldiers.
   In an army survey, 65 percent of soldiers questioned said they
had witnessed rough treatment of Palestinians by troops, said the
army's chief psychologist, Col. Shlomo Dover, on Israel radio.
   ``We don't have problems with the motivation of soliders ... not
that they rejoice to do it, but it's an assignment that has been
given to the army and that's how it is seen by the soldiers,'' he
said.
   Since the wave of protests began Dec. 8 in the territories
Israel seized in the 1967 Middle East War, Israelis have killed 61
Palestinians. The latest fatalities were two men shot and killed by
soldiers Sunday.
   The government has spent $330 million, or 1 percent of the
government's 1988 budget, in an attempt to quell the violence.
   Palestinians held memorial services Monday to mark Arabs killed
by Israeli soldiers.
   About 1,500 Arabs marched through Kfar Naama in the West Bank to
mourn the loss of the second village to die in the violence that
began Dec. 8. Marchers listened to a series of defiant speeches
condemning Israel's occupation and renamed one of the roads, The
Street of the Martyrs of the Uprising.
   No soldiers appeared, and no violence was reported.
   In another memorial service today, women marched to a cemetery
in the West Bank village of Anabta to honor three residents who
died in clashes with the army earlier this month.
   A Molotov cocktail was thrown at an Israeli car in the West Bank
town of Ramallah, but no one was injured, the army said.
   In the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Jabaliya, soldiers clashed
with protesters, and a 14-year-old boy was shot in the thigh,
doctors at Gaza City's Shifa Hospital said.
   In Gaza City, anti-American slogans painted in red on closed
store shutters read: ``No to the Shultz visit. Yes to the
Palestinian government. Yes to the PLO.''
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has ordered Palestinians
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip not to meet with Shultz, saying he
is pro-Israeli and has rejected minimal Palestinian demands.
   But local Palestinian leaders said today that they were trying
to persuade PLO chief Yasser Arafat to lift the ban. U.S. officials
met with several Palestinian representatives over the weekend to
discuss the Shultz visit.
   During his visit, Shultz will present to Israeli leaders a U.S.
peace initiative calling for an international forum for direct
talks on Palestinian self-rule and negotiations on a final
settlement by December.
   But Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told European Jewish leaders
Sunday night he objected to the hurried pace: ``Any attempt to
force the pace and shorten the period (of self-rule) would be a
detriment to the very essence of the agreement.''
   He also indicated he would not give in to pressure to accept the
American plan: ``When the time comes for decisions, we shall decide
on the basis of what is in our national interests.''

<HEAD>Court To Decide Affirmative Action Issue From Virginia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to study a key
affirmative action issue _ the power of local governments to
require minority participation in public works projects.
   The justices said they will hear an appeal by Richmond, Va.,
officials seeking to revive a so-called set-aside program for
construction industry businesses owned by minorities.
   The court previously expressed interest in examining the issue
when on Jan. 19 it asked the Justice Department to comment on a
construction company's challenge to a set-aside program in the
Miami area.
   But the justices stopped short of announcing whether they will
hear arguments in the Miami dispute.
   In the Richmond case, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
ruled last September that the city's preferential treatment for
minority businesses approved in 1983 is an unconstitutional form of
reverse discrimination.
   The Richmond plan would require the prime contractor on any city
building contract to subcontract at least 30 percent of the value
of the project to firms that are at least one-half minority owned.
   The minorities covered by the plan were blacks, Hispanics,
Orientals, Indians, Eskimos and Aleuts.
   The appeals court, in its 2-1 decision, relied heavily on a 1986
Supreme Court ruling that struck down an affirmative action plan in
Michigan designed to protect from lay-offs minority teachers with
less seniority than whites.
   The Supreme Court in that case said preferential treatment of
minorities must be narrowly tailored to avoid hurting whites. The
court restricted the power of employers to adopt affirmative action
programs when there has not been proof those employers practiced
past discrimination.
   Supporters of local set-aside programs, on the other hand, point
to a 1980 Supreme Court ruling that Congress may require 10 percent
of federal public works contracts be earmarked for
minority-controlled businesses.
   An eventual Supreme Court ruling on local set-aside programs
would have far-reaching impact.
   Most states and some 160 local governments have such programs,
according to a study by the Minority Business Enterprise Legal
Defense Education Fund.
   The 4th Circuit court, in striking down the Richmond plan, said
the city's program was adopted on scant evidence of past
discrimination.
   The appeals court noted that minorities comprise about half of
Richmond's population and that minority-owned businesses had
received less than 1 percent of the value of the city's public
building contracts.
   But the appeals court said there are few minority-owned
businesses in the city area, and there was no evidence they had
been victims of past discrimination.
   ``General population statistics suggest, if anything, more of a
political than a remedial basis for the racial preference'' quota
in the set-aside program, the 4th Circuit court said. ``There has
been no showing that qualified minority contractors who submitted
low bids were passed over.''
   The appeals court also said the 30 percent quota ``was chosen
arbitrarily. The figure simply emerged from the mists.''
   ``The Richmond ordinance reflects the most casual deployment of
race in the dispensation of public benefits. It prefers some, and
in so doing diminishes the rights of all,'' the appeals court said.
   A coalition of groups representing local and state governments
urged the Supreme Court to reinstate the Richmond plan.
   The coalition said it would reopen old wounds and discourage
affirmative action if governments must first show past
discrimination before adopting remedial programs.
   The coalition groups are the National League of Cities, the U.S.
Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Counties and the
International City Management Association.
   Richmond's plan was challenged by the J.A. Croson Co. after its
bid _ the only one submitted _ to install stainless steel urinals
and water closets at the city jail was rejected.
   City officials refused to award the contract after Croson said
there was only one unqualified minority contractor that could help
on the project. The company said the cost of the project would rise
by $7,663 if the minority contractor were used. The city then
called for new bids.
   The case is Richmond vs. Croson, 87-998.

   Sara and Amy Kienast glare at each other
over feet propped on the dining room table and argue the finer
points of rock 'n' roll music. They both like it, but Amy wouldn't
be caught listening to REM.
   And so it goes with the Kienast quintuplets: They are so much
alike yet so different.
   Sara, Amy, Abby, Ted and Gordon turn 18 on Wednesday and hope
the day marks the end of media-mobbed birthdays and the beginning
of separate lives.
   ``We've been five all our lives. Now is our chance to be one,''
said Sara as her brothers and sisters nod in agreement. ``We want
to make a name for ourselves, by ourselves.''
   After years of press scrutiny, well-publicized financial
problems and the suicide of their father, the quints are a steely
bunch and proud of it.
   They also are distinctly individual. Each plans to attend a
different college and four have picked schools far from the
spacious farmhouse in this New York City suburb where they grew up.
   ``It's about time,'' Abby said with a grin. ``I've been with
them for 18 years. I could make do without seeing their faces every
day.''
   None plans to tell new friends he or she is a quintuplet.
   ``Why should we have someone look at us and think of four
different people,'' said Sara.
   The quints say their separation in the fall will be painless
because they all live separate lives now.
   ``We basically have the same friends, but we don't hang out with
the same people,'' said Amy. ``On the weekends, we don't do things
together.''
   The siblings say that all that sets them apart from other
teen-agers is that there are five of them.
   ``We have the same fights, you know, that other brothers and
sisters have. The girls are always taking my sweaters and stuff,''
Ted said to the protests of his sisters.
   The quints gained worldwide attention when they were born Feb.
24, 1970, after their mother, Peggy Jo Kienast, took fertility
drugs.
   At first, many offers of help and endorsement opportunities
clothed and fed the children. But financial pressures began a few
years later and an anonymous source saved them from eviction by
providing more than $115,000 to pay off mortgages and property
taxes the Kienasts owed.
   In 1984, the quints' father, William, committed suicide after
his plastics business began to falter.
   At that most difficult time, reporters and photographers camped
outside the family's home, making the family angry.
   ``I really started to resent the media when dad died,'' said
Sara. ``There's a limit you can take.
   ``I understand now,'' said Ted. ``They have a job to do and
someone sends them out to get a picture and they have paychecks and
families, too. But at the time it was too much.''
   Despite the unwanted attention, the quintuplets say they
appreciated the cards and letters they received from around the
world when their father died.
   They also say they have put his death behind them.
   ``We couldn't dwell on it,'' Amy said. ``Mom wanted us to get on
with our lives.''
   Mrs. Kienast says she's looking forward to her children leaving
home.
   ``I'm all for parenting and children, but I don't live through
my children. I'm looking forward to this next step,'' she said.
``You're worn out by their senior year.''
   The quints' birthdays _ what Ted calls ``press day'' _ have
always been met by clicking cameras and a string of interviews. But
this year will be different: The quints plan to go their separate
ways and celebrate with friends on Wednesday, then hold a private
family party on Sunday.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let Texas Hospital Withhold Names of Blood Donors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let a Texas
hospital withhold the names of its blood donors from a woman who
says her baby daughter contracted AIDS after receiving transfusions.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the donors'
privacy rights do not override Belinda Jackson's need to find out
their identities in her wrongful-death lawsuit against the hospital.
   Ms. Jackson sued the Tarrant County Hospital District in 1986,
alleging that her daughter, Tristainne, died of Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome after receiving blood transfusions in 1983 at
John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth.
   In pretrial discovery proceedings, Ms. Jackson sought to find
out the identities and addresses of all blood donors whose blood
had been used in the treatment of her prematurely born daughter.
   Hospital district officials asked for permisssion to withhold
the information, contending that releasing it would violate the
donors' privacy rights and threaten the future availability of a
volunteer blood supply program.
   Judge William L. Hughes Jr., who is presiding over the state
court case, ruled for Ms. Jackson in late 1986, but later blocked
any disclosure of the blood donors' identities so the hospital
district could appeal.
   A state appeals court also ruled for Ms. Jackson, and the Texas
Supreme Court refused to hear the hospital district's appeal last
Oct. 7.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the hospital district
said it is unclear whether restrictions imposed by the state judge
would block Ms. Jackson from asking friends, co-workers and others
about intimate and discreet details about the donors' personal
lives.
   ``The parameters of the constitutional right of privacy of blood
donors should be considered and defined by this court,'' the
hospital district lawyers said. ``A viable national supply of blood
and blood products is at stake.''
   The case is Tarrant County Hospital District vs. Hughes, 87-1082.

   An army colonel accused in the 1986

military sources said.
   Lt. Col. Eduardo ``Red'' Kapunan was placed under house arrest

   Last week, Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa ordered the
arrest of Kapunan and three other members of a military group known
as Reform The Armed Forces Movement in connection with the Nov. 13,
1986, slaying of leftist leader Rolando Olalia and his chauffeur.
   Two of the four remained at large and the other member, navy
Capt. Rex Robles, also is under house arrest at Camp Aguinaldo.
   A letter purportedly written by Kapunan and given to Filipino
reporters denied he was involved in the slaying of Olalia.
   ``I am innocent of these charges being leveled against me and I
believe this is all part of a grand scheme to discredit all of us
who were involved in the February revolution which installed Mrs.
(Corazon) Aquino as president,'' it said.
   Kapunan said because he has been implicated in the Olalia case
he has become an enemy of the Kilusang Mayo Uno, or May First
Movement, a leftist labor movement that blames the military for
Olalia's death.
   Meanwhile, Robles left his house Monday and started to walk with
his wife to a post chapel for a Mass for members of his movement
but military police made him return home, his wife said.
   The Mass marked the second anniversary of the day when then
Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and then-Lt. Gen. Fidel Ramos
broke with President Ferdinand E. Marcos as part of the ``people
power'' revolution in February 1986 that led to the downfall of
Marcos and the rise of Aquino.
   Last week, members of the military reform movement claimed
Ramos, now defense secretary, had failed to check corruption during
his tenure as military chief of staff and had used his position to
increase his personal wealth.
   Ramos has dismissed the allegations made in a letter by the
Reform the Armed Forces Movement.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Search Warrant Issue in Florida Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide when
police need court warrants before searching from helicopters for
marijuana growing in fenced-in yards.
   The justices said they will study a Florida Supreme Court ruling
that a helicopter search by sheriff's deputies in Pasco County four
years ago violated the right of privacy.
   The nation's highest court in 1986 ruled that a warrantless
search by Santa Clara, Calif., police in an airplane had not
violated privacy rights.
   In that case, police spotted marijana plants growing in a
fenced-in yard while flying at a lawful altitude of 1,000 feet.
   Voting 5-4 then, the justices said the Constitution's Fourth
Amendment, which bans unreasonable government searches, ``simply
does not require the police traveling in public airways at this
altitude (1,000 feet) to obtain a warrant in order to observe what
is visible to the naked eye.''
   In the Florida case, Pasco County deputies received an anonymous
tip that Michael A. Riley was growing marijuana in his yard.
   Unable to tell what plants were growing in a greenhouse in the
yard, the deputies flew over the yard in a helicopter, at an
altitude of about 400 feet. From there, they could look into
missing panels in the greenhouse roof.
   Based on what they saw, the deputies obtained a search warrant
and entered Riley's yard, seizing 44 marijuana plants.
   Riley challenged the helicopter search, seeking to block
prosecutors from using the marijuana plants as evidence against him.
   The Florida Supreme Court last July 9 ruled for Riley, stating
that the helicopter search violated Riley's reasonable expectation
of privacy under the Fourth Amendment.
   The state court said the 1986 decision did not authorize ``an
unlimited right to any type of examination of residential property
from the air.''
   The state court added, ``Surveillance by helicopter is
particularly likely to unreasonably intrude upon private activities
... because of a helicopter's virtually unlimited maneuverability
and observational capabilities.''
   It noted that fixed-wing airplanes are not authorized to fly
lower than 500 feet in the area where the search occurred.
   Florida prosecutors filed the appeal acted on today.
   The case is Florida vs. Riley, 87-764.

<HEAD>Court Will Decide Iowa Case on Taxing Oil and Natural Gas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether states may tax any income from oil and natural gas
extracted from the Outer Continental Shelf.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Shell Oil Co.
challenging an Iowa tax.
   The state tax is designed to be imposed on that portion of a
company's income derived from doing business in Iowa.
   Shell Oil said it was improper for state officials to include
any revenue from offshore gas and oil in determining the company's
taxable income.
   Shell said the state tax violates a 1953 federal law authorizing
exploration and production of Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas.
   The shelf is underwater land more than three miles off the shore
of any state. The land is owned by the federal government and
leased to private companies.
   The Iowa Supreme Court upheld the state tax last October. It
said the levy ``is in no way dependent upon the exercise of
legislative jursidiction on Outer Continental Shelf lands'' that
the 1953 federal law was intended to prohibit.
   Including revenue from OCS oil and gas ``apparently aids in
obtaining an accurate measure of the tax to be imposed as a result
of Shell's Iowa activities,'' the state court said.
   The Reagan administration agreed with the ruling of the Iowa
court but urged the U.S. Supreme Court to use Shell's appeal to
settle the dispute.
   Justice Department lawyers noted that the Iowa case would be a
good one for the high court to use in examining state tax authority
because the Iowa tax takes into account sales both on and off the
Outer Continental Shelf.
   The case is Shell Oil vs. Iowa, 87-984.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to reconsider
its 4-4 decision last December striking down an Illinois law that
could have made abortions more difficult to obtain for some
teen-agers.
   The justices, without comment, rejected a request by Illinois
Attorney General Neil F. Hartigan that they restudy the law ``after
the appointment of a ninth justice.''
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy joined the court last Thursday,
filling an eight-month vacancy. He did not participate in today's
order denying reconsideration.
   Despite his 12-year tenure as a federal appeals court judge,
Kennedy's legal views on abortion are unknown.
   The high court's decision in December was not accompanied by a
written opinion, but merely upheld a ruling that the challenged
Illinois law impermissibly interfered with abortion rights.
   Such even splits among the justices automatically uphold lower
court decisions in the particular cases but set no national
precedent.
   In seeking reconsideration, Hartigan emphasized the importance
of ``a decision by a full court'' in the case.
   The Illinois law required that girls under 18 and still
financially dependent on their parents notify both parents 24 hours
before having an abortion.
   The law allowed a girl to avoid notifying her parents if she
could prove to a state judge that she was mature enough and
well-informed enough to make the decision on her own and that
notifying her parents would not be in her best interest.
   Doctors who failed to comply with the law's requirement faced
criminal prosecution.
   A federal appeals court ruled that the 24-hour waiting period is
an impermissible infringement on the right to have an abortion,
established by a landmark 1973 Supreme Court decision.
   The appeals court also said the Illinois law provision for
parental notification or judicial permission could not be enforced
because it did not ensure confidentiality and anonymity for girls
who appeal when a judge denies permission for an abortion.

   A 24-hour transport strike
called by leftist guerrillas virtually halted bus and truck traffic
today and drastically curtailed use of automobiles.
   The strike was called by members of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front to protest legislative and municipal elections
scheduled for March 20. The rebels say the elections are a farce.
   No buses circulated in this capital of 1 million people.
Thousands of people walked to work, although some pickup trucks
jammed with passengers were on the roads.
   The army said it doubled motorized patrols to provide security
for people who defied the strike.
   The private radio station YSU said truck and bus traffic
nationwide was about 5 percent of normal. From the western
provincial capital of Santa Ana, the radio reported that the
stoppage of buses was total.
   It said two buses of 50 that normally would have been dispatched
left the eastern provincial capital of San Miguel for other cities.
   The leftist guerrillas have been fighting the U.S.-backed
government since 1979 with a campaign that includes economic
sabotage.
   There were seven guerrilla-imposed transport strikes last year.
Three strike violators were killed, about 30 were wounded and some
160 vehicles were destroyed or damaged.

<HEAD>Justices Will Consider Reversing Nevada Basketball Coach's Victory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today said it will consider
reversing a victory basketball coach Jerry Tarkanian won in his
legal battle with the NCAA.
   The justices agreed to review a decision barring the NCAA from
suspending Tarkanian as coach at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas
for alleged recruiting and other violations.
   Lower courts also awarded Tarkanian substantial reimbursement
for legal expenses.
   Tarkanian, who has coached at UNLV since 1973 during a highly
successful 30-year career, was accused by the National Collegiate
Athletic Association in 1976 of numerous rule violations.
   NCAA officials said Tarkanian arranged for a student to get a
``B'' grade without attending class, provided free air fare to a
student-athlete, encouraged individuals to give the NCAA false
information to impede its probe, falsely certified UNLV's program
as being in compliance with NCAA rules and failed to comport with
high ethical standards.
   The NCAA placed the UNLV basketball program on two years'
probation in 1977 for recruiting violations and ordered the
university to suspend Tarkanian from coaching for two years.
   But Tarkanian obtained a court order blocking the suspension and
continued coaching.
   The Nevada Supreme Court ruled last August that the NCAA
violated Tarkanian's constitutional rights by failing to afford him
due process in its 2{-year investigation.
   The state court said the probe was based largely on
recollections by investigators of interviews with their sources.
Notes of the interviews sometimes were dictated after the fact, the
state court said.
   It also said Tarkanian and UNLV officials presented signed
affidavits by those the NCAA interviewed in which the witnesses
contradicted the NCAA's evidence.
   ``In the circumstances of this case, this procedure does not
comport with due process requirements,'' the state court said.
   The state court also ruled that the NCAA, a private organization
representing nearly 1,000 colleges and universities, acted in the
capacity of the state in depriving Tarkanian of his rights.
   Purely private organizations cannot violate anyone's
constitutional rights.
   The Nevada Supreme Court said the NCAA is vested with state
power in this case because Tarkanian works for a state school.
   ``The right to discipline public employees is traditionally the
exclusive prerogative of the state,'' the Nevada court said. ``UNLV
cannot escape responsibility for disciplinary action against
employees by delegating that duty to a private entity (the NCAA).''
   A state court judge awarded Tarkanian $200,000 in legal fees.
The state Supreme Court said the the sum should be reduced, and
ordered further hearings to determine the amount.
   In the appeal acted on today, NCAA officials said Tarkanian was
treated fairly.
   They also argued that Tarkanian got a ``home court'' advantage
by taking his case to a Nevada state judge who overruled the
findings of the NCAA investigators.
   The judge ruled ``in favor of a popular, local personality''
substituting his views ``for that of 21 independent teachers and
administrators who heard all of the evidence,'' the NCAA's appeal
said.
   The case is NCAA vs. Tarkanian, 87-1061.

   Flash floods roared through
central South Africa today, killing at least 12 people and leaving
hundreds of others without homes.
   Up to 12 inches of rain soaked parts of Orange Free State
province during the weekend, washing out roads, bursting dams and
flooding huge stretches of farmland, authorities said.
   Military helicopters plucked 200 people from houses, trees, cars
and areas inaccessible by road, the air force reported.
   Telephone lines were down in many areas, and the city of
Bloemfontein, the capital of the Orange Free State, only could be
reached by air, officials said.
   Rivers in the region have overflowed their banks and many small
towns have been evacuated, officials added. Heavy rains were
predicted to continue through Tuesday, forecasters said.
   Officials said the storm killed 12 people and forced several
hundred others to flee their homes.
   Lulu de Jager, spokesman for the Orange Free State Agricultural
Union, said farm damage from the flooding would run into millions
of dollars.
   ``We will start a survey when the weather clears up, but we may
take if for granted that crop and livestock losses have been
astronomical,'' de Jager said.
   Heavy flooding last September in the southeastern part of the
country left more than 300 people dead and 500,000 homeless.

<HEAD>Court Will Study Illinois Tax on In-State Calls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to judge the
validity of a 5 percent tax Illinois imposes on all telephone calls
charged to in-state numbers.
   The court said it will study arguments that the tax interferes
impermissibly with interstate commerce.
   The tax is assessed at a flat rate on all calls, intrastate and
interstate, charged to Illinois service addresses.
   Two state residents, Jerome F. Goldberg and Robert McTigue,
challenged the law in a class-action lawsuit three years ago in
Chicago. GTE Sprint Communications Corp. joined the case later,
seeking to recover taxes already paid.
   From Sept. 15, 1985, to July 1986, GTE Sprint paid $2.6 million
in taxes under the challenged Illinois Telecommunications Excise
Tax.
   The Illinois Supreme Court upheld the tax last June 24,
reversing a state appeals court ruling that had invalidated it.
   The appeals court had said Illinois ``is attempting to tax the
entire cost of an interstate act which takes place only partially
in Illinois.''
   The appeals court had added, ``This tax ... discriminates
against interstate commerce and it is not related to services
provided in Illinois.''
   The state Supreme Court acknowledged that Illinois is taxing the
``gross charge'' of an entire interstate call ``even though the
benefits it affords are limited to that portion of the
communication occurring within the state.''
   But it said the tax does not unduly burden interstate commerce.
   The two state residents and GTE Sprint filed separate Supreme
Court appeals, and the National Taxpayers Union urged the justices
as a ``friend of the court'' to strike down the tax.
   Its brief argued:
   ``If Illinois attempted to tax United Parcel Service on the
entire value of its service for all packages picked up in the
state, regardless of where they were delivered, that tax would fall
before the (Constitution's) commerce clause ... Telecommunications
companies, whether they are in the telephone, telegraph or
electronic data transmission business, provide a service which, for
many purposes, is functionally identical.''
   The cases are Goldberg vs. Sweet, 87-826, and GTE Sprint vs.
Sweet, 87-1101.

   An Amtrak official defended the actions of
crew members aboard a train that caught fire over the weekend,
saying that despite passenger complaints, several lives may have
been saved.
   Passengers aboard Amtrak's California Zephyr said they received
no warnings or instructions from crew members after the fire broke
out early Saturday, killing a chef and injuring 19 other people.
   ``I think our on-board crew's initial instinct was to make sure
passengers weren't in any danger from the fire. Then they had to
get employees out of the car,'' said Amtrak spokesman John Jacobsen
in a telephone interview from Washington.
   ``We could have easily had four or five employees killed in that
dormitory car yesterday,'' Jacobsen said.
   However, the actions of a conductor and his assistant may have
saved several lives, Jacobsen said.
   Conductor J.P. Jones, of Arvada, Colo., and assistant conductor
Todd M. Witaker of Denver separated the crew car from the train's
baggage car and engine to reach people endangered by the smoke,
Jacobsen said.
   The fire aboard the 14-car westbound train carrying 294
passengers and a crew of 18 was reported about 3 a.m. as the train
was pulling into Hastings for a scheduled stop. Hastings Fire Chief
Jim Mitera said the blaze was under control about 90 minutes later.
   Passenger Sara Bentley of Fremont said later it was a miracle no
one panicked.
   ``I think the worse thing was that they didn't let anyone in our
car know whether we were in danger,'' Ms. Bentley said. ``We
couldn't find out if our car was safe.''
   Jacobsen said an Amtrak investigation was continuing, and that
no disciplinary action had been taken against any crew members. The
National Transportation Safety Board also was investigating.
   Jacobsen said the fire may have been caused by luggage or some
other flammable material placed near a heater in a crew car,
contrary to earlier findings by the Nebraska State Fire Marshal's
office that pointed to an electrical short in the heater.
   Amtrak investigators didn't find evidence of a short, Jacobsen
said. State Fire Marshal Wally Barnett said he would stand by the
state report.
   ``We're fire investigators, and we think we're right,'' Barnett
said Sunday.
   The victim, identified as chef Cesar Arguelles, 70, of Chicago,
was one of seven crew members on the car, Jacobsen said. County
Attorney Gary Anderberg said an autopsy showed the chef died of
smoke inhalation.
   Nine crew members and three passengers were treated for smoke
inhalation at Mary Lanning Hospital. All but two had been released
by this morning, nursing supervisor Mona Mueller said. Those two
were in satisfactory condition and were expected to be released
today.
   Jacobsen said the fire probably would prompt Amtrak officials to
renew their search for an effective smoke alarm for their trains.
But no models work now because they are often set off by the
constant vibrations of trains, he said.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Moves Michigan Adult Bookstore Dispute to Federal
Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that forces Ann Arbor, Mich., city officials to justify in federal
court a zoning ordinance limiting where adult bookstores may be
opened for business.
   The court, without comment, refused to hear arguments aimed at
squelching a lawsuit challenging the ordinance.
   The ordinance limits the area where adult bookstores may locate
to a portion of downtown Ann Arbor representing less than 1 percent
of the land within the city's 25.3 square miles.
   Adult bookstores are defined by the ordinance as those where
sexually explicit materials comprise more than 20 percent of the
stock in trade. So any business establishment, anywhere in the
city, may have up to 20 percent of its trade in adult materials.
   Karen Christy, who sought to operate an adult bookstore in an
area not zoned for adult entertainment, sued the city. She sought
to block enforcement of the zoning ordinance.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Joiner refused to block enforcement,
ruling that the ordinance is not impermissibly restrictive.
   ``The 20 percent requirement provides a beneficial way for
decentralization of the adult book business,'' he said. ``By
sanctioning the selling of adult books and other books together,
the city has eliminated most of the well-known problems of urban
blight that result from concentrations of these bookstores without
sacrificing its citizens' First Amendment freedoms,'' Joiner said.
   But the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last July 23
that Joiner was wrong.
   ``A city cannot arbitrarily limit the exercise of First
Amendment rights,'' the appeals court said. ``A limitation of adult
materials to 20 percent of a bookseller's wares conditions the
constitutional right to speak in one way on the bookseller's
willingness to speak in a different way 80 percent of the time.''
   The appeals court sent the case back to Joiner for further study
after saying it found no evidence ``of a legitimate government
objective for the passage of this zoning ordinance.''
   In the appeal acted on today, city officials argued, among other
things, that the Constitution's First Amendment does not guarantee
the existence of adult bookstores if ``the right of access to such
materials may be accommodated in other ways.''
   The case is Ann Arbor vs. Christy, 87-649.

   The military today said a
South African pilot was missing after his plane was shot down in
southeast Angola during a weekend air raid.
   The plane was struck by ground fire while attacking Cuban and
Angolan government troops during a battle Saturday, the military
said. It was the second time during South Africa's five-month
intervention in Angola that it acknowledged losing one of its
warplanes inside the country.
   The Angolan news agency ANGOP reported today that Angolan
government troops shot down two South African jetfighters over the
weekend and have scored significant gains in recent battles against
South African units and the Angolan rebel movement UNITA.
   South Africa launched two other air attacks Saturday in southern
Angola against bases of the South-West African People's
Organization, known as SWAPO, in retaliation for the bombing Friday
of a bank in South-West Africa. The death toll in the bombing
reached 20, South-West African police said today.
   South Africa also announced that it followed up the air attacks
with long-range mortar bombardments Saturday and Sunday on SWAPO
positions. The military said the mortar attacks were
``successful,'' but did not disclose any details.
   South Africa occupies South-West Africa, also known as Namibia,
in violation of a United Nations resolution. Its forces regularly
enter Angola to raid SWAPO bases.
   During the Saturday afternoon attack, a plane piloted by Maj.
Edward Every was downed by ground fire, the military said, adding
that the air raid was staged because the Angolan-Cuban forces
``posed a potential threat'' to South African troops.
   The ANGOP report, monitored in Lisbon, Portugal, identified one
of the downed South African pilots as Maj. Every, and said Angolan
officials had recovered his personal effects.
   The report did not specify whether Every was in Angolan custody,
and did not identify the pilot of the other plane, both of which
were French-made Mirage fighter bombers.
   In a separate dispatch, ANGOP reported that South African
bombing raids caused ``countless deaths'' over the weekend.
   South Africa announced in November that its troops were fighting
in Angola to support the National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola, or UNITA, rebel movement. However, it is widely believed
that South African troops began fighting in Angola one month
earlier, in October.
   UNITA has been fighting a 12-year bush war for a power-sharing
agreement with Angola's Marxist government, which is backed by
Cuban and Soviet forces.
   President Eduardo dos Santos of Angola said Sunday that 9,000
South African soldiers are deployed in southern Angola. He also
said South Africa has staged 16 air raids so far this year, and
that six South African planes have been shot down and 140 of that
nation's soldiers have been killed.
   South Africa has repeatedly refused in recent months to disclose
the extent of its military involvement in Angola. However, it has
announced the deaths of more than 30 soldiers since November.
   The military said in November that one of its warplanes had
crashed in Angola while participating in an attack on SWAPO forces
and that another plane had been hit but managed to return to a base
in Namibia before crash-landing.

<HEAD>Kemp, Dole Lead in January Donations; Bush Still Has Most Cash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republican presidential contenders Jack Kemp
and Bob Dole each collected $1 million or more in contributions
during January, leading all the candidates, financial reports
showed today.
   But rival George Bush still sits the most comfortably, ending
the month with more than $9 million in cash on hand. That compared
to $4 million for Dole, the senator from Kansas, and $446,067 for
Kemp, the New York congressman who had $1.3 million in debts after
paying off $2.5 million with the federal matching funds he got in
January.
   The financial disclosure statement for former television
evangelist Pat Robertson was not on file this morning at the
Federal Election Commission, although the reports were due Saturday.
   Bush raised $767,892 in contributions for the month, but he also
got $6.4 million in federal matching funds based on his total
fund-raising from last year. Dole got $1.2 million in contributions
and $5.6 million in matching funds during January, and Kemp raised
$1 million in donations, $3.9 million in matching funds and
$750,000 in loans.
   On the Democratic side, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois and Rep.
Richard Gephardt of Missouri both went into February's Iowa
caucuses and New Hampshire primary in debt and had to take out
loans.
   Both have said their fund-raising has improved since then.
   Democrats Michael Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, and Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, on the other hand, apparently were in
good shape _ Dukakis with $4 million in the bank, and Gore with $2
million.
   Gore however, while abandoning the Iowa race to devote attention
to the Southern states, raised just $180,746 for the month of
January, in addition to the $1.8 million in matching funds he got.
   Dukakis raised $804,839 in contributions and got $3.5 million
matching funds.
   Matching funds were released in January based on the candidates'
fund-raising for all preceding months.
   Simon's finance director Bob Edgar said the senator has raised
more than $1 million in donations so far this year, and in the two
weeks following the Feb. 8 Iowa contest set a record for his
campaign.
   His report shows that in January he raised $534,259 in
contributions, got $1.9 million in matching funds, and $523,674 in
loans.
   Gephardt collected $212,702 in contributions and $1.9 million in
matching funds.
   The reports of Democrats Gary Hart and Jesse Jackson were not on
file this morning, nor was that of Bruce Babbitt, the former
Arizona governor who dropped out of the race last week.
   Republican Pete du Pont, the former Delaware governor who also
dropped out of the running last week, closed his campaign with
$564,223 in cash on hand and $59,089 in debts, his report showed.

<HEAD>Court Will Hear Appeals in Black Lung Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear appeals
by the Reagan administration and coal mining companies seeking to
block the possible award of billions of dollars in black lung
disease benefits to thousands of miners.
   The court said it will review a ruling that the government must
reopen some previously rejected claims for benefits.
   The administration said the ruling by a federal appeals court,
if extended nationwide, could force officials to re-examine 94,000
claims at potentially tremendous cost to the overburdened fund that
pays benefits to miners afflicted with the disease.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last March ruled that
thousands of miners seeking the benefits had been unfairly denied a
hearing.
   The ruling applied to miners with less than 10 years of work in
the mines whose claims were denied in the late 1970s and early
1980s.
   The appeals court said the U.S. Department of Labor must take a
fresh look at the claims under liberalized standards adopted by
Congress in 1977. The appeals court applied the ruling to miners
who failed to exhaust their administrative remedies or who missed
deadlines for filing court appeals.
   The appeals court said miners seeking benefits ``have
encountered enormous frustration in the processing of their claims
due to administrative delays and determinations under improper
standards. Congress has repeatedly attempted to ease the burden of
proof of disability and to expedite black lung claims.''
   The Justice Department said the ruling would force the Labor
Department ``to embark on a potentially enormous reopening of
closed cases that will impose a massive administrative burden. The
records for approximately 94,000 claims would have to be retrieved
and analyzed'' if the appeals court ruling were to apply nationwide.
   The 8th Circuit court has jurisdiction in North and South
Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa, Arkansas and Missouri.
   Congress has created a special fund to pay off claims for miners
with black lung disease, also known as pneumonconiosis.
   Coal mine operators owe the government some $3 billion that has
been loaned to the fund from the federal treasury.
   The operators said the 8th Circuit court ruling, if applied
nationwide, could burden the industry with $13.6 billion in
additional payments.
   The U.S. Treasury ``will be required to borrow the money to pay
these claims until the coal industry is able to do so, if that day
ever comes.''
   In another dispute over black lung benefits, the Supreme Court
in December made it easier for mining companies to block the award
of some disability benefits. That decision upheld a Labor
Department rule that miners are not entitled to an interim
presumption they were disabled by the disease based on a single
piece of medical evidence.
   The cases acted on today are Pittston Coal Group vs. Sebben,
87-821, and Whitfield vs. Sebben, 87-827.

   Police are getting numerous calls
from people who say they have seen a 4-week-old girl kidnapped from
her mother's home, but so far officers have turned up no suspects.
   Rachael Ann White was taken Friday when her grandmother left the
room while interviewing a woman for a babysitting job.
   The phone has been ringing steadily at the Colorado Springs
Police Department with reports from area residents who say they
have been the infant with the woman who kidnapped her, but so far
police have been unable to trace the infant or her abducter,
officer Mike Stewart said today.
   Cora Abbott, mother of the missing baby, said authorities won't
tell her specifically ``what they're working on for fear I'll get
my hopes up and then it'll turn out to be nothing.''
   ``The most important thing we have is the composite (drawing) of
the female suspect. That person has to stop somewhere for gas,
groceries. There's got to be someone out there who has information
on that person,'' police Lt. Joe Vernier said Sunday.
   No ransom has been sought, police said late Sunday.
   Abbott, 27, was working when the abduction occurred. Her mother,
Evelyn Reed of Canon City, told police she was interviewing a woman
for a babysitting job at her daughter's home when the telephone
rang.
   Reed said she handed the baby to the woman and went into another
room to answer the phone. When she returned the woman was gone.
   The woman was described as Hispanic with reddish-tinted black
hair, 5-feet-6 tall, 150 pounds, and 40 to 45 years old.

<HEAD>Tennessee Families Challenging `Godless' Textbooks Lose Appeal</HEAD>

Atorney, with other cases, comment.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today threw out an appeal by
seven Tennessee families who say their religious freedom was
violated when their children were exposed to ``godless'' public
school textbooks.
   It also agreed to study a key affirmative action issue _ the
power of local governments to require minority participation in
public works projects.
   And it agreed to judge the validity of a federal law creating
independent counsels to investigate alleged wrongdoing by
high-ranking executive branch officials.
   It was Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's first day on the court,
which was at full strength for the first time since last June 26
when Justice Lewis F. Powell retired.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that requiring
the fundamentalist Christian children to read the books was
constitutional.
   Today's action essentially ends a widely publicized case some
have called Scopes II, a comparison to the furor surrounding the
1925 prosecution of John Scopes in Tennessee for teaching evolution.
   The controversy began in 1983, when the Hawkins County Board of
Education adopted a new reading list for students in grades 1-8.
Pupils initially were allowed to read from other textbooks if they
desired, but the school board later eliminated that alternative.
   All county schoolchildren were required to read the chosen
textbooks or leave public school.
   The seven families who filed the appeal acted on today sued the
county school board in late 1983, listing more than 300 objections
to the assigned readings.
   The lawsuit objected on religious grounds to themes or passages
in such works as ``The Wizard of Oz'' and ``Cinderella,'' science
fiction by Isaac Asminov, fairy tales by Hans Christian Andersen
and stories by anthropologist Margaret Mead, among others.
   The lawsuit said the books in dispute violated the families'
beliefs by teaching evolution, secular humanism, the occult,
feminism and other beliefs, theories or philosophies they consider
godless.
   A federal trial judge ruled for the families, finding that their
religious freedom had been violated and awarding them $50,000 in
damages.
   He ruled that the children should have been allowed to ``opt
out'' of the reading program while enjoying the rest of the public
school curriculum.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling and
threw out the families' lawsuit.
   ``The only conduct compelled ... was reading and discussing the
material ... and hearing other students' interpretation of those
materials,'' the appeals court said. ``What is absent from this
case is the critical element of compulsion to affirm or deny a
religious belief or to engage or refrain from engaging in a
practice forbidden or required in the exercise of (any child's)
religion.''
   In seeking Supreme Court review, lawyers for the families said
the case ``presents a classic confrontation between parents and
public school officials over the education of children.''
   They said children should not be required to read religiously
offensive books as a condition of remaining in school.
   The appeal likened the families' objections to those made by
Jehovah's Witnesses families that sparked the Supreme Court's 1943
decision striking down a West Virginia law that required all public
school students to participate in the daily recitings of the pledge
of allegiance.
   The appeal added, ``The rule emerging from (the 6th Circuit
ruling) is that children can be forced to read books which violate
their sincere religious beliefs so long as they are not forced to
believe the contents of what they have read.''
   Tennessee Attorney General W.J. Michael Cody said expressed
pleasure at the decision and said ``any alternative disposition
would have been the cause of chaos in the school system.''
   But Mike Farris, attorney for Concerned Women of America who
represented the East Tennessee families, called for the removal of
all born-again Christian children from the public school system as
a result of the decision.
   In the affirmative action case, the justices said they will hear
an appeal by Richmond, Va., officials seeking to revive a so-called
set-aside program for construction industry businesses owned by
minorities.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last September that
the city's preferential treatment for minority businesses approved
in 1983 is an unconstitutional form of reverse discrimination.
   Setting the stage for a major constitutional decision over
independent counsels, the justices said they will review an appeals
court ruling that the Watergate-era law impermissibly gives
presidential powers to the federal courts.
   The decision, expected by July, will affect the criminal
conviction of former White House aide Michael K. Deaver and the
stalled investigation of ex-Justice Department official Theodore B.
Olson.
   In a separate order, the court rejected Marine Lt. Col. Oliver
North's latest attempt to block an investigation of his role in the
Iran-Contra affair. It let stand a ruling that North may not halt
the criminal investigation by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh
by challenging its legality in a civil lawsuit.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Refused to let a Texas hospital withhold the names of its
blood donors from a woman who says her baby daughter contracted
AIDS after receiving transfusions.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the donors'
privacy rights do not override Belinda Jackson's need to find out
their identities in her wrongful-death lawsuit against the hospital.
   _ Agreed to hear appeals by the Reagan administration and coal
mining companies seeking to block the possible award of billions of
dollars in Black Lung disease benefits to thousands of miners.
   The court said it will review a ruling that the government must
reopen some previously rejected claims for benefits.
   _ Let stand a ruling that drastically limits the power of
communities to regulate cable television and raises doubts about
the constitutionality of a key federal law governing cable
operations.
   The court, citing a lack of jurisdiction, turned away an appeal
by two California cities barred from enforcing public access and
other rules challenged by a cable operator.
   _ Agreed to decide when police need court warrants before
searching from helicopters for marijuana growing in fenced-in yards.
   The justices said they will study a Florida Supreme Court ruling
that a helicopter search by sheriff's deputies in Pasco County four
years ago violated the right of privacy.
   The textbook case is Mozert vs. Hawkins County Public Schools,
87-1100.

   A videotape by Lt. Col. William R. Higgins on
behalf of demands by his captors was ``obviously ... made under
duress,'' the White House said today.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the tape had been
viewed by members of the National Security Council and White House
staff but he did not believe President Reagan had seen it.
   ``Obviously it was made under duress,'' Fitzwater said. ``We
continue to call for the immediate and safe release of Colonel
Higgins as well as other hostages in Lebanon. We are not going to
give in to the demands of terrorists. We will continue to pursue
all avenues for his release.''
   When asked if Reagan had any reaction, the spokesman said, ``You
know the president's deep convictions about Colonel Higgins and all
the hostages, but we want to avoid saying anything that could
exacerbate the situation.''

   Democratic presidential contender Michael Dukakis said today at
the White House that the Reagan administration's anti-terrorist
policy is worthless because of arms dealing with Iran. In the
Midwest Republican Bob Dole taunted George Bush for refusing to
compete in Minnesota and South Dakota.
   Dukakis, speaking to reporters after a National Governors'
Association meeting with the president, said, ``I'd have a much
tougher, and much more consistent anti-terrorist policy.''
   The Massachusetts governor, referring to the sale of arms to
Iran during secret negotiations to free American hostages, said,
``We'll be living with the consequences of what happened in 1985
for a long time.''
   ``You never, ever make concessions to terrorism. If you ever do
it, then your policy is worthless. And that's what we did,'' said
Dukakis.
   Asked about Dukakis' statement, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said, ``I think it's very dangerous to make terrorism a
political issue, especially when you're talking about specific
episodes.
   Vice President Bush, who has said repeatedly he supported
Reagan's Iran initiative but was involved with few details, was
campaigning in South Carolina today. But Dole, in Duluth, Minn.,
was suggesting Bush wasn't where he should have been.
   Minnesota and South Dakota, the next two events on the long road
to the 1988 presidential nominations, vote on Tuesday.
   ``We're ready to do well here tomorrow. We're here to play,''
Dole told supporters in Duluth today.
   ``I don't know where George Bush is,'' Dole said. ``I didn't
find him yesterday in Wyoming. Couldn't find him in South Dakota.
Couldn't find him in Minnesota. Must be somewhere. And these are
very important states. Later today we're going to send him a map of
Minnesota so at least he gets a little idea where it is.''
   Among the Democrats, Richard Gephardt, who also finished first
in Iowa, is bidding for a strong showing in South Dakota's
Democratic straw poll to give him a boost as the campaign moves
toward the Super Tuesday showdown on March 8.
   The 4,067 Minnesota caucuses are the first step toward choosing
78 delegates to the Democratic National Convention, while on the
Republican side caucus attendees will mark a non-binding straw
ballot to express their presidential preference.
   In South Dakota's primary, Republican voters will determine
allocation of 18 convention delegates, while the Democrats will
hold a beauty contest ballot that will not have a binding effect on
who gets the state's national convention delegates.
   Bush, faced with the potential of a repeat of the Iowa results
in which Midwesterner Dole was a big winner, is concentrating on
the South where he hopes to cripple the Kansas senator's effort.
   Dole is a strong favorite in South Dakota, while Minnesota is
shaping up as a three-way fight between Dole, Rep. Jack Kemp of New
York and former television evangelist Pat Robertson.
   Dukakis, winner of the New Hampshire Democratic presidential
primary, is campaigning hard in both these upper Midwest states in
an effort to prove he can win support outside his native New
England.
   After an appearance at the National Governors Association
meeting in Washington, including a session with President Reagan,
Dukakis was flying to Minnesota to campaign.
   On his way into the White House for a black-tie dinner Sunday
night, Dukakis quipped, ``I'm just looking the place over, that's
all.'' Asked where he hoped to be next year, Dukakis replied, ``I
hope right here.'
   Gephardt, who has made tough action to correct trade imbalances
a cornerstone of his campaign, got a blow from his House colleagues
when words came out they planned to scuttle his legislation that
would impose sanctions on countries that maintain large trade
surpluses with the United States through unfair practices.
   ``We're going to dump it because it's bad policy,'' said Rep.
Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., chairman of the Trade subcommittee of the
House Ways and Means Committee.
   ``I'm going to fight for my amendment,'' said Gephardt, when
told of the plan.
   Much of the sniping between presidential rivals was being done
by long distance.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, who made little effort in
Iowa and not much more in New Hampshire while pursuing a Southern
strategy for the Democratic nomination, was interviewed on the NBC
show ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday and got in jabs at both Dukakis
and Gephardt.
   The senator attacked Gephardt for shifting positions. ``It's not
a case of just having one or two or three issues where he has
changed 180 degrees,'' said Gore. ``There is a long, long list of
issues.''
   Turning to Dukakis, Gore said the governor has not had ``a
single day's experience in foreign policy.''
   Dukakis' spokesman Leslie Dach quickly retorted that ``Al Gore's
never had a day of experience balancing a budget or building an
economy.''
   Gephardt was attacking Dukakis in ads running in South Dakota
that criticize the Massachusetts governor for not supporting farm
legislation sponsored by Gephardt and Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin. The ads
also take a shot at Dukakis for once suggesting in Iowa that
farmers ought to consider diversifying into such crops as Belgian
endive.
   The ads drew retorts from Dukakis supporters in both Minnesota
and South Dakota.
   ``A new low in South Dakota presidential politics,'' said State
Sen. Roger McKellips, a co-chairman of Dukakis' South Dakota
campaign.
   After his surprising second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses,
Robertson was considered a strong contender in Minnesota where
caucus organization is once again important.
   The former evangelist was in Spartanburg, S.C., on Sunday and
told a crowd of about 4,000 at a church dedication that ``the
problem facing America is not a government problem but a moral
problem.''

   Pentecostal leaders and worshipers expressed sympathy, Jim
Bakker offered advice, Tammy Bakker cried and Jessica Hahn said she
was shocked after TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart quit his pulpit
because of a reported sex scandal.
   Swaggart tearfully told his congregation in Baton Rouge, La., on
Sunday that he would leave his ministry ``for an undetermined,
indeterminate period of time'' because he had sinned.
   Many members of the congregation gathered around Swaggart after
the service to cry, pray and hold hands.
   ``I think he's truly repentant. And I think he's set a
tremendous example for all of us of what true repentance is
about,'' said congregant Evelyn Murray.
   Swaggart said the future of his ministry was up to the Lord and
officials of his denomination, the Assemblies of God, who
reportedly were reviewing photographs purporting to show Swaggart
and a prostitute entering and leaving a motel room.
   Church officials and congregants praised the candor of the
evangelist, whose broadcasts reach into more than 100 countries and
whose ministry had an income estimated at $142 million in 1986.
   Forest H. Hall, secretary-treasurer of the Assemblies' he and his wife,
Tammy, were ``kind of sick to our stomachs''
over the news of Swaggart's problems and added, ``Our heart goes
out to them and their family.
   ``My advice to Jimmy would be don't do anything for about a
month and just pray, and then make decisions. I made a very bad
mistake by making decisions too quick,'' Bakker said.
   Bakker resigned from his PTL ministry in March and later was
defrocked by the Assemblies of God after admitting to a sexual
encounter with Miss Hahn, a church secretary.
   Mrs. Bakker said she cried when she heard about Swaggart's
troubles. ``I just felt like I didn't want anyone to suffer the way
our family has had to suffer this last year,'' she said Sunday.
``We love him and we're praying for him.''
   The Rev. Jerry Falwell, who took over the PTL ministry for eight
months after Bakker left, said: ``I am deeply saddened over this
tragedy. With the credibility crisis in recent days involving Wall
Street, the world of politics and the arena of religion, many
sincere people have had their faith shattered.''
   David Clark, the trustee of PTL appointed by U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, said, ``It's hard to assess the impact on the so-called
electronic church. I'm sure our telephones will tell us tomorrow
what they're thinking.''
   Miss Hahn, who accepted secret payments from PTL to cover up her
encounter with Bakker, said she expected Swaggart's troubles to
affect contributors.
   ``When they turn on the TV, they're going to see a preacher and
wonder if this offering is paying hush money or for a prostitute
... I just feel bad,'' she said.
   Miss Hahn said she had heard months ago Swaggart was going to be
involved in the current controversy, but when she learned of his
public confession, ``I almost fell on the floor.''
   ``What shocked me was that he resigned. I feel really bad about
this. It hit me. I think that there's too many preachers hanging
vendettas over each other,'' she said in a telephone interview from
the Playboy mansion where she lives in Los Angeles.

   A forest fire sparked by a hiker's campfire and fanned by 90 mph
gusts slowed today after threatening up to 100 houses near Boulder,
Colo., and a wind-whipped 2,400-acre blaze in Montana destroyed at
least four houses.
   No injuries were reported.
   Roads in Colorado's Sunshine Canyon area were closed late Sunday
and occupants of one apartment building near the blaze voluntarily
left the building, as did residents of five homes. But no
evacuations were ordered and the roads were reopened today.
   The fire grew to more than 200 acres of grass and light timber
by early today, the Boulder County Sheriff's Department said.
   The area was under a high wind warning with 90 mph gusts
reported. Wind had been expected to reach 100 mph today, but at 3
a.m. it subsided to gusts of no more than 30 mph and there was an
early morning calm of 6 mph, the National Weather Service said.
   ``The fire has laid down considerably since last night,'' said
firefighter John Gregg. ``It's not contained in the sense that
there is no fire line around the fire completely, but it's not
spreading out of control as it was last night when the winds were
high.''
   Strong wind blew through much of the Rockies on Sunday.
Afternoon and evening wind gusted to 65 mph in Cody, Wyo., and near
Calgary, Alberta, chinook wind forced postponement of the final
heats of the men's two-man bobsled competition at the Winter
Olympics.
   The Colorado fire started on Boulder's Mountain Park land in
Sunshine Canyon and threatened 80 to 100 homes, said sheriff's
spokesman Brian Leach.
   ``I don't know of one that has threatened as many structures as
this one,'' he said.
   Warm, dry and windy conditions existed just before the fire was
reported about 5 p.m. Sunday. No buildings had burned by early
today, as the fire burned about one-half mile southwest of Boulder
Memorial Hospital.
   About 100 firefighters battled the blaze.
   Residents of suburban Sunshine Canyon were asked to be ready to
leave their homes in case the fire crossed a ridge into their area,
the sheriff's department said.
   One family evacuated that subdivision Sunday night, and four
families in Boulder did so by today, according to reports from the
scene.
   As flames topped a ridge above one neighborhood, homeowners
hooked up garden hoses to spray their roofs and started packing.
   ``I'm scared to death,'' said ne resident Patricia Grant.
   Colorado Highway 119 through the fire area was closed overnight
between Boulder and Nederland, as were two other roads, but they
were reopened today.
   Sheriff's Sgt. Ernst L. Little said a 30-year-old hiker told
police he had started a campfire that apparently caused the blaze.
   In southwestern Montana, a grass fire whipped by gusts up to 50
and 70 mph raced across 2,400 acres south of Whitehall and
destroyed four houses before being brought under control early
today, said Dan Fisher, assistant chief of the Whitehall Volunteer
Fire Department.
   Firefighters from at least 10 volunteer fire departments in the
rural area northwest of Yellowstone National Park battled the
blaze, assisted by volunteers from the Forest Service, the
Department of State Lands and two mining companies.
   About two dozen families endangered by the fire were evacuated,
but might be able to return to their homes later today, Fisher
said. Emergency kitchens were set up in two Whitehall churches to
feed homeless and firefighters, and emergency sleeping space was
provided at the high school gymnasium and in private homes.
   The houses that burned were scattered rural residences.
   The wind ``is as bad as I've ever seen it,'' said Glen Hanson, a
trapper who lives on the south edge of town. ``The ... stuff was
going faster than you could run.''
   Whitehall Fire Chief Dale Davis said the blaze started Sunday
when a cottonwood tree was blown over and severed a Montana Power
Co. line two miles south of Whitehall.
   Flames estimated at 20 to 30 feet high licked the tops of trees
along the Jefferson River, and Jefferson County Fire Warden Doug
Schmitz said the fire jumped the river.
   The fire charred an area three miles wide and two miles long,
and firefighters said some ranchers cut barbed wire fences to set
their cattle, horses and sheep free ahead of the racing flames.

   Fire raced through a ski resort hotel in
Bulgaria before dawn today, killing six people and injuring 36
others, Bulgaria's official news agency reported.
   The news agency BTA said the fire in Borovets, a ski resort 22
miles southeast of Sofia, began at 3 a.m.
   ``Measures were taken to put out the blaze but the building was
quickly engulfed in flames,'' said the BTA report received in
Vienna. ``In the panic that followed, six people died.''
   The agency said two of the dead were Dutch, one was Bulgarian
and three had not been identified.
   Of the 36 injured, BTA said 17 were British, four Soviet, five
West German, seven Greek, two Danish and one Dutch, according to
BTA. Their names were not released.
   ``The causes of the fire are still not known,'' the news agency
said, adding a commission was appointed to investigate ``the tragic
accident.''
   BTA identified the dead Dutch visitors as ``Ms. Ever
Vanderberg'' and ``Mr. Peter Zekelenburg.'' Their home towns were
not made public. The name of the dead Bulgarian was not reported.
   An unidentified man who answered the telephone at the Bulgarian
state tourist office in Borovets said the 170-bed hotel was
destroyed in the blaze. He refused to give further details about
the fire.
   Initial reports from Western diplomats in Sofia said Britons,
West Germans and Dutch tourists were injured when they jumped out
hotel windows to escape the blaze at the Moussala hotel. The
diplomats, contacted by telephone from Vienna, spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Several Western embassies said they had sent diplomats to
Borovets to try and learn more about the fire.
   Bulgaria has recently made great efforts to encourage Western
tourists to visit its mountain resorts on comparatively cheap ski
vacations.
   Carol Thatcher, daughter of British prime minister Margaret
Thatcher, was a recent visitor to Borovets, a picturesque village
in the Rila Mountains. It is close to Mount Moussala, the highest
peak in Bulgaria at 9,652 feet.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Approves Overhaul of Nuclear Regulatory Commission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation to replace the five-member Nuclear
Regulatory Commission with a Nuclear Safety Agency headed by a
single administrator was approved Monday by a Senate subcommittee.
   Sponsors of the package said the change is needed to end
internal battling at the NRC, help restore public confidence in
nuclear power and provide better inspection and regulation of
commercial generators.
   The bill, worked out by Sens. John Breaux, D-La., and Alan
Simpson, R-Wy., also would create a Nuclear Reactor Safety
Investigations Board to conduct independent reviews of major
accidents and safety problems at nuclear facilities.
   The package also sets up an inspector general to monitor
internal operations of the nuclear licensing agency and create an
Office of Investigations to look for wrongdoing by nuclear
licensees.
   Breaux said ``it is only through a program of more effective
regulation that the confidence of the American people in the
benefits of this technology will be restored. ...
   ``The record amply demonstrates that the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission is a collegial body that rarely makes its most important
decisions collegially,'' Breaux said.
   Discussing the commissioners, Simpson said ``they don't
communicate with each other.'' He said the NRC suffers from a
``pernicious diffusion of accountability and responsibility'' that
produces ``indecisive, ineffective, inefficient regulation of the
commercial nuclear industry.''
   Frank Ingram, a spokesman for the NRC, said the agency had no
immediate comment on the details of the legislation but added that
``a majority of the commission supports a single administrator
concept.''
   The bill was approved by voice vote of the Environment and
Public Works subcommittee on nuclear regulation.

   The Spanish Communist Party elected Julio
Anguita as its new secretary-general Monday, ending at least
temporarily the leadership crisis that has threatened the survival
of the once influential party.
   Anguita, leader of the Communists of the southern Andalusia
region and former mayor of Cordoba, was elected by the 100-member
Central Committee at the end of the party's three-day 12th congress.
   In accepting the post, the 46-year-old son of an army officer
called on the workers and intellectuals who have left the party to
return.
   The congress took place amidst struggles with problems of
direction and membership, which has fallen to 62,300 from a high of
more than 150,000 during the 1979 general elections.
   Under outgoing Secretary-General Gerardo Iglesias, the party
tried to broaden its appeal to include ecological and pacifist
groups and to reach out to the middle class.
   The United Left coalition, which includes the Communists, now
holds seven of the 350 seats in the Spanish lower house of
Parliament, down from a peak of 20 seats held by the Communists
alone after the 1979 elections.

<TEXT>
   The United States and Soviet Union today gave
their arms control negotiators one month to complete the key
provisions of a new treaty to sharply reduce their strategic
nuclear weapons.
   The decision was taken as U.S. Secretary of State George P.
Shultz wound up two days of talks in Moscow. He said negotiators in
Geneva who have so far failed to make significant progress toward a
50 percent cut in long-range nuclear weapons were directed to
report to him and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in
Washington March 22-23.
   In another development, Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov
announced the Soviet Union would begin to withdraw its
shorter-range SS-12 missiles from East Germany and Czechoslovakia
late this month as a ``display of goodwill.''
   Elimination of the missiles is required under the
intermediate-range nuclear weapons treaty President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev signed in December. The treaty
has not yet been ratified in the Soviet Union or United States.
   Last week the East German news agency ADN reported that troops
had begun dismantling SS-12s, based in Waren, East Germany.
   Shultz also told a news conference the Soviets indicated they
would be more flexible in handling emigration applications, except
for those from people who have had access to state secrets.
   Shevardnadze confirmed ``categorically'' that only those with
information the government considers important to national security
would be barred from emigrating, according to Shultz.
   Earlier today, as he opened talks with Shultz, Gorbachev pledged
to achieve peace in Afghanistan and to try to reach a new nuclear
arms agreement by spring.
   Shultz and the Sov ... munist Party general secretary smiled
broadly as they shook hands and sat down with their aides in
opulent Catherine's Hall in the Kremlin.
   At a picture-taking session, Gorbachev said the Soviets would
``do our best to achieve peace in Afghanistan and to have a
non-aligned, neutral Afghanistan whici would have good relations
with its neighors, with the United States and with the Soviet
Union.''
   At the news conference, Shultz said he did not have the
``slightest doubt'' that the Soviet Union would leave Afghanistan.
But Shultz, who came here saying he would seek a specific
timetable, gave no evidence he had received one.
   An estimated 115,000 Soviet troops have been in Afghanistan
since December 1979, backing a pro-Moscow government at war with
U.S.-armed Moslem guerrillas.
   Gorbachev has promised to begin a withdrawal on May 15 if the
Kabul government and Pakistan can agree on terms of a settlement by
March 15.
   Shultz, who arrived in Moscow on Sunday, met until 1:30 a.m.
today with Shevardnadze, then held talks with Premier Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov before meeting Gorbachev.
   After the talks, Shultz did not say whether the Soviets agreed
to support the seven-month U.S. effort in the United Nations to
impose a worldwide arms embargo against Iran for refusing to comply
with a U.N.-ordered cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war.
   Shultz also vehemently denied that he sought Soviet backing for
his Middle East peace initiative.
   ``I didn't come here with my hat in hand looking for support,''
he said.
   He said the parties in the region, Arabs and Israelis, would
determine whether his trip to the Middle East later this week will
succeed.
   The secretary of state has questioned whether the Soviet Union
can play a bigger role in that region because of its human rights
record and its lack of relations with Israel.
   On nuclear arms, Gorbachev said ``there is still a chance'' of
an agreement to reduce by half U.S. and Soviet long-range nuclear
weapons by the spring. The idea would be to have the pact ready for
him and Reagan to sign at a Moscow summit.
   Gorbachev and Reagan signed an agreement in Washington Dec. 8 to
eliminate their intermediate-range missiles, which have a range of
about 300 to 3,000 miles. The current negotiations in Geneva
concern those with a range above 3,000 miles.
   The Geneva talks have been held up because of disagreements over
the future of Reagan's ``Star Wars'' anti-missile program and how
to verify any new arms treaty.
   Shultz said the negotiators would have until his meeting in
Washington with Shevardnadze to put together three draft documents
dealing with verification procedures, ways to eliminate or convert
the weapons and methods to help inspectors observe treaty
compliance.
   On Sunday, Shultz quizzed Andrei D. Sakharov about human rights,
arms control and Soviet reforms and met with a group of Jewish
refuseniks to underscore U.S. concern for human rights in the
Soviet Union.
   Sakharov, who won the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to
protect human rights, met with reporters after seeing Shultz.
   Sakharov said the Soviet Union has not yet made enough progress
to merit holding an international human rights conference. ``As a
precondition for such a conference, I see the liberation of all
prisoners of conscience, and the complete end of the war in
Afghanistan,'' he said.
   Sakharov, a physicist, helped develop the Soviet hydrogen bomb
in the 1950s. He was exiled to the closed city of Gorky in January
1980 for speaking out against the Soviet military intervention in
Afghanistan.

<HEAD>South African Warplane Downed In Angola, Heavy Combat Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military said Monday a
South African pilot was missing after his plane was shot down in
southeast Angola during a raid on Angolan and Cuban forces.
   Angola's Marxist government reported ``violent combat'' in the
area and said two of South Africa's French-built Mirage fighters
were downed during low-altitude bombing runs Saturday near the
garrison town of Cuito Cuanavale.
   The announcement by South Africa marked the second time during
its five-month intervention in Angola that it acknowledged losing
one of its warplanes inside the country. It has been fighting in
support of the UNITA rebel movement.
   Military headquarters said a plane piloted by Maj. Edward Every,
31, was downed by ground fire during a raid staged because
Angolan-Cuban forces ``posed a potential threat'' to South African
troops.
   Angola also identified Every by name but did not say whether he
was dead or captured. It gave no details about the pilot of the
other plane it claimed to have downed.
   South Africa said it launched two other air attacks earlier
Saturday in southwest Angola against guerrilla bases of the
South-West African People's Organization, known as SWAPO, in
retaliation for the bombing Friday of a bank in South-West Africa.
The death toll in the bombing rose by two to 20 Monday, South-West
African police said.
   South Africa said it followed up the retaliatory air raids with
mortar bombardments Saturday and Sunday on SWAPO positions. A
military statement said the mortar attacks were ``successful,'' but
gave no details.
   SWAPO has denied responsibility for the bank bombing. It said
Monday that South Africa's retaliatory raids ``hit innocent
civilians'' but not SWAPO bases.
   South Africa occupies South-West Africa, also known as Namibia,
in violation of a United Nations resolution. Its forces regularly
enter Angola to raid bases of SWAPO, which has been fighting since
1966 for Namibia's independence.
   South Africa announced Nov. 11 that its troops had intervened in
Angola's civil war. It is widely believed that South African troops
entered Angola weeks earlier.
   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ has been fighting a 12-year bush war for a power-sharing
agreement with Angola's government, which is backed by Soviet
advisers and 40,000 Cuban troops.
   Angola's president, Eduardo dos Santos, said Sunday that 9,000
South African soldiers are deployed in Angola. He said six South
African planes have been shot down and 140 South African soldiers
killed this year.
   South Africa has refused to disclose the extent of its
involvement in Angola. It has reported the deaths of more than 30
soldiers since November, and says all its combat fatalities are
announced.
   The military said in November that one of its warplanes crashed
in Angola while engaged in an attack on SWAPO forces. It said
another plane was hit but returned to a base in Namibia before
crash-landing.
   Angola's news agency, ANGOP, quoted defense officials Monday as
saying South African forces renewed their attack on Cuito Cuanavale
on Saturday, two days after Angola announced its forces had
repelled a drive to take the strategic town. Now reportedly
deserted, Cuito Cuanavale had been the forwardmost staging point
for government attacks on UNITA strongholds in Angola's southeast
corner.
   Anolga's Defense Ministry said ``countless deaths'' had resulted
from South African air raids on the southwestern towns of N'Giva
and Lubango. Those were the raids which South Africa said were
aimed at SWAPO bases.
   ANGOP reported heavy fighting in central Angola along the
east-west Benguela railway, and said 200 UNITA guerrillas were
killed.

Seat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Joseph I. Lieberman
today officially announced his challenge of maverick Republican
Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. in this year's Senate race.
   Weicker, 56, who announced his candidacy for a fourth term
earlier this month, has made a name for himself as a liberal
Republican, frequently at odds with his party and president. He has
championed constitutional issues and civil rights and worked
against school prayer and balanced budget amendments.
   He squeaked into office for a third term in 1982, but says he
expects this to be the biggest win of his career. Early polls give
him the lead but show Lieberman in a good position for a challenger.
   Lieberman, 45, a Democratic former state senator who ran
unsuccessfully for Congress in 1980, said he'll focus on a single
theme between now and November: What has Weicker done for
Connecticut?
   The populist attorney general attacked Weicker for using the
Senate as ``a debating society'' for his own agenda, issues that
don't do much for the average person.
   As attorney general, Lieberman has seized on non-partisan
consumer and environmental issues, such as grocery store coupon
rip-offs, increased electric rates and dumping sewage into the
Connecticut River.
   The candidates will be determined at state party conventions
this summer. So far, Weicker is unopposed and Lieberman has only
token opposition from Gary Johnson, who describes himself as a
veterans' rights advocate.

   The koala, Australia's national
symbol, could become extinct unless long-term plans are devised to
protect its habitat, an expert on the cuddly marsupials warned
Monday.
   ``I am positive that if we don't take immediate action the
koala, our famous `animal ambassador,' will slowly but surely slide
down the inevitable path toward extinction,'' said Don Burnett,
president of the Koala Preservation Society.
   He told a three-day koala symposium at Melbourne University
extinction was only a matter of time as urban development erodes
the creature's natural habitat.
   Koalas are found only on the eastern coast of Australia. They
survive on a species of gum leaf and in recent years a venereal
infection has devastated koala colonies.
   It is generally acknowleged that koalas were more prevalent
prior to European settlement of Australia in 1788, but no figures
are available on their number today.

<TEXT>
   Wind gusting to more than 50 mph hurled debris
into windows at the Sears Tower early today, damaging 90 panes and
forcing police to close streets around the world's tallest
building, authorities said.
   But police said there were no reports of injuries from falling
glass.
   Initially, building officials reported that 19 windows were
broken and six others were cracked on the east and southeast sides
of the 110-story building, said Ernie Arms, a spokesman for Sears,
Roebuck and Co., whose corporate headquarters are in the building.
   A survey later in the morning by building engineers found that
90 windows were broken or cracked as the wind gusted to 56 mph, he
said.
   ``They're not blown out,'' Arms said. ``What happened is
something flying through the air _ like a pebble from the roof of
another building _ hit and broke one window and then others were
damaged as that one window came down.''
   The broken and cracked windows were located between the 50th and
88th floors and are among 16,000 windows in the 1,454-foot tall
building.
   Arms said authorities closed one entrance to the building,
leaving two others open. And police Patrolman Frank Daio said
authorities were forced to block traffic during the morning rush
hour on the four streets surrounding the building.

   The court said it will review a ruling that threw out an appeal
by an Ohio man convicted of rape, robbery and assault.
   The defendant, Steven Anthony Penson, was convicted of charges
stemming from a breaking and entry by three men into a Montgomery
County, Ohio, home on Aug. 4, 1984.
   The three intruders sexually assaulted a man and two women, and
also robbed the home.
   After Penson was convicted and sentenced to 18 to 28 years in
prison, his attorney refused to file an appeal on grounds there was
``no meritorious issue'' for an appeals court to consider. Lawyers
for Penson's two convicted co-defendants did appeal their
convictions.
   Penson's lawyer then withdrew from representing him and Penson
filed his own appeal.
   An Ohio appeals court said it was troubled by the conduct of
Penson's lawyer. But the appeals court said, ``We find (Penson) has
suffered no prejudice in his counsel's failure to give a more
conscientious examination of the record.''
   The appeals court upheld Penson's conviction.
   The Ohio public defender's office that was later assigned to the
case said in its appeal to the Supreme Court that Penson's rights
were violated.
   The public defender said the burden of proving Penson received
ineffective legal assistance in pursuing his appeal improperly was
placed on the defendant. The public defender argued that Penson
should not be required to show specific omissions or errors to
establish a presumption he received inadequate representation.
   Penson's original lawyer, in refusing to file the appeal, failed
the requirement that he state in writing the grounds that arguably
could support an appeal, the public defender said.
   The public defender urged the Supreme Court to elaborate on a
1967 ruling that set some standards to judge the effectiveness of
lawyers handling appeals.
   The case is Penson vs. Ohio, 87-6116.

   A judge today ordered that the start of
Gov. Evan Mecham's trial on criminal charges of concealing a
$350,000 campaign loan be delayed until March 22.
   Judge Michael Ryan of Maricopa County Superior Court ordered the
delay from the original March 9 trial date to allow both sides time
for handling pretrial motions and answers.
   Mecham is charged with six counts of fraud, perjury and filing
false documents in connection with the $350,000 campaign loan made
in October 1986 by Tempe developer and attorney Barry Wolfson.
Willard Mecham, his brother's 1986 campaign treasurer, faces three
similar counts.
   Mecham also faces a Feb. 29 impeachment trial by the State
Senate and a May 17 recall election.
   Assistant Attorney General Michael Cudahy said he needed more
time to reply to defense motions in the criminal case. Cudahy also
complained that attorneys for the Mechams had not yet made required
pretrial disclosures, including lists of witnesses and exhibits.
   The governor's lawyers were given until March 7 to file a motion
seeking return of the charges to the grand jury for a new finding
that enough evidence existed to support the charges.
   Ryan today also scheduled a March 2 hearing on several motions
that were filed last week by Willard Mecham's lawyer, Michael
Scott, and joined today by defense attorney Murray Miller on behalf
of the governor.
   Those motions would remand the charges, dismiss some of the
counts and require grand jurors and the prosecutor to submit to
questioning.

<HEAD>Robertson, Super Tuesday's Unknown Factor, Seen Winning Some
States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders in both political parties, trying to assay the
hard-to-measure strength of Pat Robertson, say they expect he'll
win some Southern Republican presidential primaries on Super
Tuesday, come in second in others and pick up a substantial share
of the 700 delegates up for grabs that day.
   Interviews by Associated Press reporters in the 16 states
holding Republican primaries or caucuses on March 8 underscore that
the former television evangelist is a wild card, his strength
unfathomable but clearly formidable.
   ``We've got seven phone lines and they're jammed with calls
these days,'' says North Carolina GOP chairman Jack Hawke. ``People
are asking questions you just don't hear a lot _ how is a precinct
organized, how is a person registered. It leads me to believe they
(Robertson supporters) are active across the state.''
   Says Hawke's Democratic counterpart, Jim Van Hecke: ``I think
he's scared the established Republican Party to death.''
   Because many evangelical Christians, the core of Robertson's
support, have not participated in the nominating process in the
past, his strength in competition with George Bush, Bob Dole and
Jack Kemp is hard to gauge.
   A new question mark is whether the weekend confession of moral
waywardness of another television evangelist, Jimmy Swaggart, could
have any fallout on Robertson, who made his fame preaching before
the TV cameras.
   ``I think Bush's biggest competition in the South will come from
Robertson,'' says political scientist Merle Black at the University
of North Carolina. ``It's not inconceivable that he could beat Bush
in some of these states.''
   Political observers report that Robertson appears weak in the
three non-Southern Republican primaries _ Massachusetts, Rhode
Island and Missouri. But Jennifer Dunn, Republican chairman in
Washington state, which holds caucuses March 8, says Bush, Dole and
Robertson are so closely clumped that a prediction is impossible.
   ``I wouldn't be a bit surprised to see a 30 percent Robertson
turnout in the delegate selection, with the other candidates
splitting the rest,'' Mrs. Dunn says. Says Robertson state chairman
Bruce Hawkins: ``We're not just going to take it, we're going to
sweep it.''
   South Carolina, which holds its primary on March 5, three days
before Super Tuesday, could be an early indicator of Robertson's
strength. Observers say a strong Robertson showing there could give
him a big boost throughout the South. Robertson claims he is ready
to pull a stunner in South Carolina.
   Republican primaries or caucuses will be held on Super Tuesday
in 12 Southern states _ Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina,
Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. Nearly a third of the GOP's 2,277
convention delegates will be selected on Super Tuesday.
   ``I think Robertson in Tennessee is going to do pretty well,''
said Tommy Harper, Tennessee campaign manager for Bush. A worker at
Bush headquarters, speaking on condition she not be quoted by name,
goes further: ``Robertson is the one we are really worried about.''
   Arkansas State Democratic Executive Director Kip Blakely, trying
to assess Robertson's support, says: ``Remember the Right to Life
march a couple of weekends ago? It was raining and it was a
Saturday morning and it was freezing. There were over 3,000 people
who turned out. That's Pat Robertson.''
   Blakely predicts Robertson will win the Arkansas primary: ``I
think its his.''
   ``Robertson will probably come in second in Georgia _ if he
doesn't come in first,'' says Georgia GOP chairman emeritus Bob
Bell. ``You don't know how many people are out there in the
invisible army and how many will come out to vote. But they're
committed with a burning zeal.''
   In precinct meetings 16 days ago, Robertson won a plurality of
delegates to the county conventions which will be held in the 10
largest counties in Georgia. Only counties with populations over
80,000 held the meetings. Robertson chairman Brant Frost said
Robertson's support ranged from a low of 35 percent in Fulton
County (Atlanta) to a high of 96 percent in Bibb County.
   Next door in Alabama, Steve French, political director of the
state GOP, sees no prospect of a Robertson win.
   ``Texas is shaping up to be a Bush vs. Robertson race,'' Bush's
son, George Walker Bush, said last week in Texas.
   Robertson is seen as a factor behind Republican registration
jumps in many states.
   In Louisiana, Robertson state director Billy E. McCormack,
citing a 6 percent jump in Republican registration since October,
says, ``We feel like we were responsible for 90 to 95 percent of
them.''
   ``You take Hopkins County, a very conservative, Bible-Belt area
which had a 16 percent increase in (Republican) registration from
May to October,'' observes Stan B. Smith, political director for
the Kentucky GOP. ``You got to feel, if you put two and two
together, that a lot of that is Robertson.''
   But Bush's state chairman in Kentucky, Harold Rogers, says of
the Robertson strength: ``Essentially it's still limited to the
religious conservatives. I don't see him breaking out beyond that
very narrow base, except in spotty cases, here and there.''

   The new managers of United Press International
plan no hirings, firings or changes in service for at least two
months while they study the company's future, the wire service's
new president said today.
   ``Everything is frozen'' during the study period, Paul Steinle
said in a news conference. The new management team has not decided
on what course to follow with the financially ailing company.
   While Steinle would not deal in specifics, he said he believes
that America's news executives ``want two wire services'' but he
said he still needs to talk with people in the news industry
because he and others want UPI to become ``a market-driven
company.''
   The management and a team of 15 experts will interview the staff
and media executives, assess the company's financial situation and
look at options for the next four to six weeks. At that time they
hope to have a business plan detailing the company's future.
   Steinle works for WNW Group Inc., a media investment group whose
chairman is Dr. Earl W. Brian. Brian recently formed WNW, a holding
company, to take control of UPI from Mexican publisher Mario
Vazquez Rana.
   Brian said WNW purchased control of Vazquez Rana's stock for 10
years in UPI for a ``substantial cash payment,'' but he would not
say how much. The announcement was made late Friday.
   Brian, 45, is chairman of Infotechnology Corp., a New York firm
with at least partial interest in 22 companies, including Financial
News Network, a cable TV service. The companies are mostly in the
area of information or venture capital.
   Brian served as secretary of California's Health and Welfare
Agency when Ronald Reagan was governor and went to the 1976
Republican National Convention as a delegate in Reagan's
unsuccessful bid to defeat Gerald Ford. In 1974, he unsuccessfully
sought the Republican nomination for Senate.
   He told The Los Angeles Times on Sunday that revitalizing UPI
under American ownership was an important personal goal. He added,
however, that his conservative views would not influence news
coverage.
   ``This thing to me is just a little deeper than an issue of
turning another company around,'' Brian said. ``As a conservative
Republican, as far as I'm concerned, UPI is an extremely important
asset to American people.''
   Giving the wire service new emphasis in such areas as financial
news and sports scores, using new technologies for delivery, are
being considered, he said. Referring to his business interests in
those areas, Brian said, ``We believe that a lot of this stuff can
be done directly by UPI itself.''
   To finance continuing losses at UPI, Brian said he will ask
private investors to put up money.
   Vazquez Rana, who paid $41 million to acquire UPI from Chapter
11 proceedings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in June 1986, reportedly
lost a million dollars a month on UPI.
   Brian and Steinle said they hoped to improve UPI's marketing
capabilities, and that Brian's presence would help.
   The new managers will be ``doing it all in English,'' Brian
said, a reference to Vazquez Rana's inability to speak English.
   Meantime, Al Rossiter, UPI's executive editor, said that
``morale is soaring'' at UPI since the new managers took over.
   One of the reasons Brian could not purchase UPI outright was an
agreement that Vazquez Rana signed with the Wire Service Guild
giving the union the right of first refusal to buy UPI.
   The new UPI managers plan to meet later today with the Wire
Service Guild.
   Earlier, guild negotiator and spokesman Dan Carmichael said the
union ``wants to see UPI remain an integrated, quality, competitive
general international news service.''
   A proxy represents a transfer of voting power represented by the
ownership shares, but not the shares themselves.

   Fifty book-lovers spent their third straight day
holed up inside a London public library Monday to protest the
library's planned closure. They passed the time reading and talking.
   ``Libraries are vital to civilized life,'' said protest
organizer Roy Charterton, 62, a marketing consultant.
   Supporters in the street below the St. Pancras Reference Library
used a rope to hoist food supplies up to the protesters.
   ``We are sleeping on the floor and bringing food up through a
window ... as we have been told if we leave we cannot get back
in,'' Charterton said.
   The sit-in began Saturday and is scheduled to continue until
Tuesday, when Camden borough councilors are due to meet.
   The borough blames government-demanded budget cuts for the
library's closure.

   The Reagan administration's long and sometimes
bumpy road to filling a vacant seat on the Supreme Court came to an
anti-climactic end on Monday, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's first
day on the bench.
   The four hours of subdued technical arguments in the hushed,
crimson-draped courtroom were a sharp contrast to the noisy and
partisan battles that preceded Kennedy's Feb. 3 confirmation by the
Senate.
   Kennedy looked solemn as he entered the chamber, strode past the
American flag, stood before the pale marble columns and took his
seat at the end of the row of nine justices. That seat, on the far
right as spectators face the court, is the traditional place for
the high court's newest member.
   A slight smile crossed Kennedy's face during a brief exchange
with Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, seated next to him, just before
Chief Justice William Rehnquist opened the session.
   The former appellate judge from Sacramento, Calif., a man with a
reputation for being deliberative and well prepared, didn't say a
word until nearly an hour had elapsed. And then he asked only one
question.
   The first argument of the four on Monday's schedule concerned
the state of Mississippi's attempt to undertake its own cost review
of the Grand Gulf nuclear plant near Vicksburg.
   Kennedy listened intently and took notes during the hour of
technical discussion.
   O'Connor and Justice Antonin Scalia, the two most recent
additions to the court before Kennedy, were among the most
aggressive questioners in the first argument.
   Kennedy waited until its closing minutes to ask his first
question from the bench of the high court.
   ``Is it fair to say,'' he asked attorney John Maxey,
representing the state of Mississippi, ``that all of the arguments
that Mississippi wants to present now ... could have been made
before FERC, even though FERC is being asked to draw a different
conclusion?''
   Maxey said no, but Kennedy's question was answered in the
affirmative by Rex Lee, the former solicitor general, today
representing Mississippi Power & Light. ``These matters can and
must be raised before FERC if they are to be raised at all,'' Lee
said.
   The next three cases involved railroad worker lawsuits against
employers, a technicality concerning sex discrimination in state
pension benefits and a surgeon suing fellow doctors over antitrust
violations.
   Kennedy's presence brought the court to full strength for the
first time since Justice Lewis F. Powell resigned in June. And it
marked a return to business as usual following months of conflict
between the administration and the Senate.
   The Senate intensely scrutinized and ultimately rejected Judge
Robert H. Bork, the administration's first nominee. Its second
nominee, Judge Douglas H. Ginsberg, withdrew after revelations that
he had used marijuana.
   Although a conservative for 12 years on the federal bench,
Kennedy is considered more moderate than either Bork or Ginsburg.
But little is known about his views on abortion regulation,
affirmative action, church-state relations or the other politically
sensitive issues on which the court is closely divided.

<TEXT>
   Women students on both sides of the
abortion issue are uneasily sharing the Yale Women's Center this
semester after the university overrode the center's decision to
exclude opponents of abortion.
   ``We've been meeting there once a week,'' said senior Kelly
Askew, president of Yale Students for Life. ``It's not entirely
welcoming, but it's getting much better. ... There was lots of
anger, bitter feelings.''
   Askew's group, which has about 10 members, asked the student
coordinating committee of the Women's Center for permission to meet
there last semester. The committee said no, largely because of
differences over abortion.
   The Women's Center, in the basement of a campus building,
provides meeting space for several organizations including the
staff of the student feminist magazine Aurora, the Women's Action
Coalition and a lesbian group.
   ``The pro-life stand made people uncomfortable,'' said Cory
Margenau, a Yale senior and a coordinating committee member. ``It
was a very unique situation with the Women's Center. We've never
had any groups who were supportive of pro-life opinions try to come
in.''
   When the coordinating committee rejected Askew's group, she said
she viewed it as discrimination.
   ``We asked if they were violating the Yale freedom of expression
policy,'' Askew said. ``The center is called the Yale Women's
Center and there's no denying the fact that we were all Yale women.
I would have no argument if they called themselves the Yale
pro-abortion center.''
   She added, ``There is a whole pressure here to be `PC,' to be
politically correct. ... Part of being PC is being pro-abortion.''
   The anti-abortion group took the matter to Yale's
administration, and both sides met with Patricia Pierce, associate
dean of Yale College.
   Sidney Altman, the dean of Yale College, made the final
decision, Askew and Margenau said.
   An assistant to Altman referred questions to Pierce, who said
the dispute ``had to do with freedom of expression and not with
one's personal political views.''
   Pierce said that as a result of the dispute, the dean's office
decided to spell out who was eligible to use the women's center:
groups primarily composed of undergraduate women and concerned with
women's issues.
   Margenau said she now agrees with Altman's decision that the
center is Yale property and should therefore be neutral, but the
Womens' Center coordinating committee saw another issue take shape
with his decision.
   ``We, the five coordinators, learned how little power we really
have when it comes to a man's decision. ... The main problem was
realizing who really had the power, and it was Dean Altman, and it
was kind of a blow,'' Margenau said.
   Countered Pierce: ``All the associate deans are women, and we
were all in on the decision, and we thought it an excellent one.''

   The Reagan administration said Monday a
videotape by Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins in which he repeated
the demands of his captors in Lebanon has no validity because it
was made under duress.
   ``All statements made by hostages are made under duress,'' said
State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley, echoing a similar
comment by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Mrs. Oakley noted that the demands, including an Israeli
withdrawal from its border security zone in south Lebanon, are the
same as those announced last Friday by the Organization of the
Opporessed on Earth, one of two groups which claim to have kidnaped
Higgins.
   She also disputed a statement by Peggy Say, sister of the
longest-held American hostage in Lebanon, that the administration
is displaying a double standard by working hardest to free captives
seized most recently.
   ``We all can understand and sympathize with her anguish and her
frustration and her sorrow over her brother's continuing
captivity,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   ``We're making our efforts on behalf of all the hostages. Our
goal is not the release of this one or that one but rather the safe
return of all the hostages.''
   Mrs. Say's brother, Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, was kidnapped on March 16,
1985.
   Mrs. Say contended that the U.S. government has been less
vigorous in seeking out her brother than Higgins, a onetime top
aide to former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.
   At the White House, Fitzwater said the Higgins videotape had
been viewed by members of the National Security Council and White
House staff but he did not believe President Reagan had seen it.
   ``We continue to call for the immediate and safe release of
Colonel Higgins as well as other hostages in Lebanon,'' Fitzwater
said. ``We are not going to give in to the demands of terrorists.
We will continue to pursue all avenues for his release.''
   Asked if Reagan had any reaction, the spokesman said, ``You know
the president's deep convictions about Colonel Higgins and all the
hostages, but we want to avoid saying anything that could
exacerbate the situation.''

   Palestinian moderates have sought permission
from the PLO to meet with U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz
when he arrives this week to launch a new American peace
initiative, Arab leaders said Monday.
   But Hanna Siniora, who reportedly solicited PLO chief Yasser
Arafat's approval for a meeting, said the prospects were dim
because the Palestine Liberation Organization doesn't want a
Palestinian delegation to meet with Shultz in Israel.
   ``The PLO is willing to have a meet$128.8 million in the
final quarter of 1987, previously had sold its retail stock
brokerage operation.
   Rothschild said it had agreed to merge its remaining operations
with Stern Brothers & Co., an investment bank in Kansas City, Mo.
Stern is a wholly owned subsidary of Franklin Financial Services
Inc., which in turn is owned by Franklin Savings of Ottawa, Kan.
   ``The merger ... will form a unique investment banking
combination,'' said Ernest Fleischer, chairman of Franklin Savings.
``It brings together the advantages of a New York trading desk and
regional distribution.''
   ``Our Stern Brothers clients will receive expanded underwriting
and distribution capabilities. For L.F. Rothschild's clients, we
will provide risk management and solid financial backing,'' he
added.
   The announcement said Franklin Financial would provide a
2{-year, $30 million loan to L.F. Rothschild & Co., the
broker-dealer subsidiary of L.F. Rothschild Holdings.
   In a separate announcement, Rothschild Holdings reported severe
losses for both the fourth quarter and all of 1987.
   Rothschild lost $128.8 million on revenues of $32.5 million in
the quarter, compared with a net loss of $15.4 million on revenues
of $92.4 million in the same period of 1986.
   For the full year, it lost $129.1 million on $461.4 million in
revenues, compared with an after-tax profit of $498,000, or 3 cents
per share, on $401.1 million in revenues in 1986.
   It said approximately $56 million of the losses resulted from
arbitrage and over-the-counter trading positions held during the
stock market's collapse in late October.
   Rothschild said its planned merger with Stern Brothers would be
subject to the approval of its stockholders and regulatory approval.
   It said Rothschild stockholders would receive a combination of
cash and preferred stock in Franklin Financial, based on the
company's book value on March 31.

   Morton Thiokol Inc. will conduct the
fourth in a series of six firing tests for the space shuttle's
redesigned booster rocket's nozzle-to-case joint Wednesday, company
officials say.
   The objective of the test is to evaluate performance of the
joint between sections of the solid fuel booster with deliberately
flawed insulation adhesive and a damaged O-ring gasket, said Morton
Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab.
   ``The test will allow engineers to evaluate the fail-safe
performance of the redesigned joint,'' he said.
   The test, to be held at the aerospace company's Wasatch
Operations plant 25 miles west of Brigham City, is one of hundreds
undertaken by Morton Thiokol as part of its booster redesign
efforts in the wake of the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the shuttle
Challenger and deaths of its seven crew members.
   A presidential commission blamed a leaking booster rocket seal
for igniting the shuttle's huge external tank for its liquid fuel
main engines.
   The new case-to-nozzle joint includes 100 added bolts,
adhesively bonded insulation surfaces and the added O-ring.

<HEAD>Scholar Who Helped Unravel Dead Sea Scrolls Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. John Allegro, renowned for his work in
deciphering the Dead Sea Scrolls but ridiculed for his theories
that Western religions were based on the worship of mushrooms, has
died. He was 65.
   Allegro died at his home on Feb. 17, his birthday, according to
death notices and obituaries published Monday. No cause of death
was given. He is to be cremated Tuesday.
   Allegro was a brilliant student of Semitic languages at
Manchester University and went on to study Hebrew dialects at
Oxford University.
   In 1953, he was named to an international team formed to
decipher the Dead Sea Scrolls, which were discovered in caves at
Qumran on the shores of the Dead Sea six years earlier.
   The scrolls, which spanned from about 100 B.C. to 70 A.D.,
included the oldest known manuscripts of books from the Old
Testament. Allegro's gift for deciphering minute texts was crucial.
His book, ``The Dead Sea Scrolls,'' was published in 1956 and
became a bestseller.
   Allegro's subsequent notoriety caused derision in the scientific
community but developed a cult following in the early 1970s.
Allegro, in his 1970 book ``The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross,''
contended that Judaism and Christianity were in fact products of an
ancient sex-and-mushroom cult.
   He theorized that Jesus's last words on the cross were not a
lament to God but ``a paean of praise to the god of the mushroom.''
   Although trained for the Methodist ministry, he became a fervent
anti-Christian devoted to debunking the story of Jesus.
   Allegro also published a 1966 book, ``Search in the Desert,''
about an unsuccessful search for lost scrolls in the Judean Desert.
   He is survived by a son and a daughter.

possible</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that drastically limits the power of communities to regulate cable
television and raises doubts about the constitutionality of a key
federal law governing cable operations.
   The court, citing a lack of jurisdiction, turned away an appeal
by two California cities barred from enforcing public access and
other rules challenged by a cable operator.
   The court's action, which appears to have been based on narrow
procedural grounds, leaves open the possibility of a subsequent
appeal.
   The dispute was between officials of Palo Alto and Atherton,
Calif., and Century Federal Inc., the cable operator.
   U.S. District Judge Eugene F. Lynch ruled last September that
cable regulations adopted by the cities unconstitutionally violated
Century Federal's free-speech rights.
   He threw out regulations that required Century Federal:
   _To provide public access channels for those not connected with
the cable company.
   _To wire the entire community to make service available to all
residents.
   _To use a ``state-of-the-art'' system to keep pace with the
latest technological advances.
   The judge, who previously had ordered city officials to award an
operating license to Century Federal, called for further hearings
to study franchise fee requirements adopted by the cities.
   Palo Alto and Atherton officials said the ruling appears to
declare unconstitutional a 1984 federal law regulating cable TV,
even though the judge did not say in so many words he was
invalidating the law.
   Although Lynch ``purported not to decide the constitutionality
of any provision of the act, (his) decision in fact holds that
numerous sections of that statute are unconstitutional,'' lawyers
for the cities said.
   The Reagan administration, in a ``friend-of-the-court'' legal
brief filed by Justice Department lawyers, urged the court to deny
the cities' appeal.
   The Supreme Court, in a 1986 ruling that has some bearing on the
case acted on today, raised the possibility that communities may be
barred from granting exclusive cable TV franchises.
   The court said cable franchise activities ``plainly implicate
First Amendment interests.'' But the justices stopped short of a
definitive ruling on the constitutional rights of cable operators.
   The ruling was in contrast to earlier decisions denying a
constitutional right to operate over-the-air television or radio
stations.
   Many cities award exclusive cable franchises city-wide or for
various regions within the city. They also impose rules similar to
those adopted by Palo Alto and Atherton.
   The case is Palo Alto vs. Century Federal, 87-946.

<HEAD>Parents Say Students Should Wear Identification Badges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some parents of students at a school
where three faculty members were shot want students to wear
identification badges and be subject to random searches with
hand-held metal detectors.
   ``We're feeling as though some of (the school's) rules and
regulations need to be looked at,'' said Ivy Villafana, whose
daughter attends Pinellas Park High School. ``If we cannot have
these metal detectors, then we can have doors that lock from the
outside.''
   About 50 parents met Sunday night to discuss ways to prevent
further violence at the school.
   They plan to submit their ideas to the Pinellas County School
Board during its regular meeting Wednesday.
   School officials were not invited to Sunday's meeting, but
representatives from the school's Parent-Teacher-Student
Association were on hand.
   On Feb. 11 two administrators and one student teacher were
wounded in an altercation with two students. Assistant Principal
Richard W. Allen died of his injuries Wednesday.
   At the meeting, one woman favored providing the school resource
officer _ a Pinellas Park police officer assigned to the school _
with a hand-held metal detector. The officer should make random
searches, she said.
   ``Doesn't have to be a reason. Just stop them and run them up
and down,'' she said.
   Principal Marilyn Heminger declined to comment specifically on
any of the group's suggestions.
   She said she was glad to hear the meeting was positive, ``and I
hope that from (the meeting) come some good things that we can work
with.''
   One of the two students accused in the shootings had recently
been suspended for cursing a teacher.
   Linda Leotti, organizer of Sunday night's meeting, told parents
that other school systems she surveyed around the country send
students to counselors before suspending them. She will suggest
Wednesday that Pinellas County institute a similar policy.
   ``We want suspensions, but we want counseling,'' Ms. Villafana
said. ``And we don't mean guidance counselors, we mean
psychologists.''
   If a student uses profanity when expressing frustration to a
teacher, he shouldn't be suspended, she said.
   Among the other suggestions: providing counseling for teachers
and students; having a substitute resource officer when the regular
officer is out; providing new carpeting to replace one with
bloodstains; having a crisis-intervention team; and having a parent
volunteer force patrolling hallways.

<HEAD>First Lady Of Oklahoma History Angie Debo Dies At 98</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARSHALL, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angie Debo, who came to Oklahoma by
covered wagon and became known as ``The First Lady of Oklahoma
History,'' has died at age 98.
   Ms. Debo, of Marshall, died Sunday at an Enid hospital, said
Steve Lindholm, owner of Abernathy Funeral Home in Crescent.
   The nationally esteemed historian wrote 13 books and hundreds of
articles about Indian and Oklahoma history. Last month, Gov. Henry
Bellmon presented her with the 1987 Award for Scholarly Distinction
from the American Historical Association.
   In a new forward she wrote at age 91 for her 1949 book
``Oklahoma, Foot-Loose and Fancy-Free,'' Ms. Debo called her home
``more than just another state.''
   ``It is a lens in which the long rays of time are focused into
the brightest of light,'' she wrote. ``In its magnifying clarity,
dim facets of the American character stand more clearly revealed.
For in Oklahoma all the experiences that went into the making of
the nation have been speeded up. Here all the American traits have
been intensified. The one who can interpret Oklahoma can grasp the
meaning of America in the modern world.''
   Her books include ``The Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic,''
``And Still The Waters Run,'' ``Geronimo: The Man, His Time, His
Place'' and ``Prairie City.''
   In 1985, her portrait was hung permanently in the rotunda of the
state Capitol, near portraits Will Rogers, Jim Thorpe, and Sequoyah.
   She earned the John H. Dunning Prize of the American Historical
Society and the Alfred A. Knopf Fellowship in history.
   A one-hour documentary on her life and work is scheduled to be
broadcast next fall as part of Public Broadcasting's ``The American
Experience'' series.
   A funeral was scheduled for Wednesday, Lindholm said, adding
that she had no surviving relatives.

<HEAD>State Threatens to Sue USC to Recover Brown's Papers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The California secretary of state's office is
threatening to sue the University of Southern California to get
back 1,600 cartons of memorabilia left behind by former Gov. Edmund
G. ``Jerry'' Brown Jr., an official said Monday.
   Brown, who served two terms ending in 1982, gave the letters,
memos, videotapes, pamphlets and personal correspondence to USC 5{
years ago. The collection includes about 4 million items.
   But Secretary of State March Fong Eu contends his action
violates a 1975 amendment to the California Public Records Act.
   The amendment declares gubernatorial and legislative papers
``public records,'' although USC's chief Sacramento lobbyist,
former state Controller Houston Flournoy, claims that Brown's
papers fall under an exception for ``personal correspondence'' and
memos from the governor's legal affairs secretary.
   On Jan. 20, Mrs. Eu's office sent a letter to USC threatening to
sue. USC received the letter in early February, and a suit will be
filed within 30 days after that unless the matter is resolved, Ms.
Warren said.
   Brown has indicated he chose USC as repository for the documents
after the University of California at Berkeley turned them down
because of lack of space and the State Archives balked at the
former governor's insistence that the agency hire former Brown aide
Lana Beckett to oversee the collection.
   USC hired Beckett but insists that she won the job in an open
competition.
   Mrs. Eu, who as secretary of state also heads the State
Archives, argues that the all documents should be in the archives.
   Brown's father, Edmund G. ``Pat'' Brown Sr., left records from
his eight years as governor to UC Berkeley. Former Gov. Ronald
Reagan left his papers to the private Hoover Institution at
Stanford. But both those administrations preceded the 1975 law.
   Assembly GOP leader Pat Nolan has introduced a measure that
would invalidate the 1975 law. The bill passed the Assembly last
year and is now in committee in the Senate.

<TEXT>
   The University of Massachusetts chancellor
on Monday rejected calls to excuse students from classes or work so
they could take part in a moratorium to consider racial tensions at
the 25,000-student university.
   ``The university administration joins the Undergraduate Student
Senate, which represents the wide majority of students on the
campus, in standing against the moratorium on classes planned by
members of the Graduate Student Senate this week,'' Joseph Duffey
said in a statement.
   Duffey said the school considered gaining social awareness part
of education, but, ``We expect students to attend class and to gain
social awareness through class.''
   ``Participating in the boycott will not excuse students from
responsibility for meeting their academic obligations,'' Duffey
said.
   The moratorium, scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, was urged
by students last week following settlement of a six-day occupation
of a university building by minority students seeking harsher
treatment of people involved in racist behavior on campus.
   About 300 students marched to Duffey's office on Friday to urge
him to sanction the moratorium.
   The Graduate Student Senate and the Minority Graduate Student
Association called for all faculty and graduate instructors to
cancel their classes, ``but still hold students responsible for the
material that would have been taught.''

   A cancer patient who has been reading Zane
Grey books since his childhood had a dream fulfilled when columnist
Bob Greene delivered a rare book that completes an 89-book
collection of the Western author.
   ``I've got something for you,'' said Greene, of the Chicago
Tribune, when he handed a small green book to 73-year-old Mack
Landers.
   The book Greene delivered Sunday in this Fort Worth suburb,
``Don, The Story Of A Lion Dog,'' was published 60 years ago and
only about 100 copies exist in this country. It was the last of 89
books Landers needed to complete his collection.
   Landers was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1982 and has been
told by doctors he has less than three months to live.
   Greene wrote of Landers' search for the book in his nationally
syndicated column, and said five or six people from across the
nation called offering copies. Greene accepted one from Dr. James
H. Vickers, president of the National Zane Grey's West Society and
director of the pathobiology and primatology laboratory at the
National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md.
   Another copy was offered by Zane Grey's son, Loren.

<HEAD>Fire Kills 6 in Bulgarian Ski Resort</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pre-dawn fire Monday destroyed a
Bulgarian ski-resort hotel that caters to foreign tourists, killing
six people and injuring 36, Bulgaria's official news agency BTA
reported.
   A Western diplomat said a Dutch woman was killed when she jumped
from a window to escape the flames.
   BTA said those injured in the fire at Borovets, 22 miles
southeast of Sofia, were from Britain, the Soviet Union, West
Germany, the Netherlands, Greece and Denmark.
   It said two of the dead were Dutch, one was Bulgarian and three
had not been identified.
   Bulgaria has made great efforts recently to attract Western
tourists to its modern mountain resorts for relatively inexpensive
ski vacations. Borovets is bidding for the 1989 Alpine skiing world
championships.
   Throughout the day, most information on the blaze at the
Moussala Hotel came from Western diplomats in Sofia, the capital,
and two British tour companies. BTA did not issue its first full
report until nearly 15 hours after the fire started.
   ``Measures were taken to put out the blaze but the building was
quickly engulfed in flames,'' the BTA report said. ``In the panic
that followed, six people died.''
   ``The causes of the fire are still not known,'' it said, and a
``special commission has been appointed to investigate.'' BTA
added: ``The necessary medical aid has been provided to the injured
and the rest of the tourists have been accommodated in other
hotels.''
   A man who answered the telephone at the state tourist office in
Borovets, and would not give his name, said the 193-bed
Alpine-style hotel was completely destroyed.
   Reports said most victims were being treated in local clinics,
but a Dutch diplomat said two injured citizens of the Netherlands
were taken to Sofia because there was no more room at the clinics.
   The Global Ski tour organization in London had 32 customers
booked at the hotel, and said a representative in Bulgaria acted as
interpreter to help police interview the injured and others.
   Several Western embassies said they sent diplomats to Borovets
seeking more information about the fire and the victims.
   Carol Thatcher, daughter of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of
Britain, was a recent visitor to Borovets. The picturesque village
in the Rila Mountains is near Mount Moussala, at 9,652 feet the
highest peak in Bulgaria.

<HEAD>US Says Sandinista Delay in Talks ``Extremely Unfortunate''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said Monday it was
``extremely unfortunate'' that Nicaraguan government cease-fire
negotiators did not respond quickly enough to a new truce proposal
to prevent the talks from breaking down.
   Spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley also welcomed what she said was the
unconditional acceptance of the proposal by the U.S.-backed Contra
rebels. The plan had been outlined by the chief mediator, Cardinal
Miguel Obando y Bravo, during talks last week in Guatemala City.
   The positive attitude of the Contras ``further indication of the
resistance's willingness to negotiate in good faith and of their
desire to achieve a cease-fire,'' Mrs. Oakley said.
   She added that the Sandinista government's delay in responding
to the proposal apparantly led to Obando y Bravo's decision to
break off the talks a day early.
   The cleric's proposal called for the Sandinistas to free all
political prisoners, allow complete freedom of expression and
resume a dialogue with opposition parties, among other measures.
   Nicaragua's leftist government has said the cease-fire
discussions should be limited to the technical aspects of achieving
a truce and that political questions should be dealt with
separately.
   Obando y Bravo's decision to suspend the talks caught the
Sandinista negotiators by surprise. They said they had been ready
to accept his plan in principle and to continue the discussions.

<HEAD>U.S. Warship Fires Warning Shots At Approaching Speedboats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. warship, arriving in the Persian
Gulf on Monday as the newest addition to the Navy's escort
squadron, fired machine-gun warning shots to chase away two fishing
boats that ventured too close.
   Although the craft proved to be harmless, a U.S. official said,
the boats at first appeared to be Boston Whaler-type vessels, often
used by Iran's Revolutionary Guards to attack commercial shipping.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Trenton fired after the boats approached within 3,300 yards of a
U.S. convoy, 30 miles off the coast of Dubai, at about 3 p.m.
   He said, ``Trenton ... issued two verbal warnings which were not
heeded, and when the boats came within 3,000 meters, it fired a
flare and bursts of .50-caliber machine-gun fire, at which time the
craft stopped and then moved off to the northeast.''
   A helicopter sent up by the missile frigate John A. Moore,
accompanying the Trenton, ``confirmed through observation that both
were fishing boats, and neither was hit or damaged,'' he added.
   While no U.S. warship has been directly attacked by Iran,
several have fired warning shots when unidentified small boats
approached too close or ignored verbal cautions.
   In one such incident last year, an Indian fisherman was killed
by gunfire from a Navy frigate.
   American ships also have fired warning shots or come close to
firing missiles at Iraqi warplanes flying too close during attack
sorties against Iranian coastal oil shipping.
   A delegation of U.S. officials is visiting Baghdad to discuss
the problem with Iraqi military leaders.
   The 17,000-ton Trenton sailed through the Strait of Hormuz hours
earlier to join the Middle East Force, the Navy's flotilla in the
gulf. It carried a 400-man U.S. Marine combat unit and a contingent
of Marine attack helicopters.
   U.S. officials said the group was not considered one of the
Navy's gulf ``transits'' as it did not include any of the Kuwaiti
tankers reflagged by Washington last year for protection from
Iranian attack.
   The Trenton, one of the ships involved in a current realignment
of navy units in the region, is a replacement.
   When the reshuffling is completed, probably within a week, it
will leave the gulf-based force at 16 ships, including six mine
sweepers, down one from its maximum strength of 17.
   Next Saturday, Rear Adm. Anthony A. Less will take over command
of the gulf force from Rear Adm. Harold J. Bernsen.
   U.S. officials said the Marines aboard the Trenton would provide
security for naval operations in the gulf, where the 7{-year-old
Iraq-Iran war has seriously affected commercial shipping.
   Iran's official news agency said a prototype of the ``first
Iranian-made airplane'' made a successful test flight Monday and
would soon go into mass production.
   It said the ``multiple-purpose'' aircraft can be adapted for
military use, and all parts were made in Iran by experts affiliated
with the Revolutionary Guards corps. Each plane will ``save
$500,000 in foreign exchange,'' said the Islamic Republic News
Agency.
   Iran also announced that at the orders of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, 1,139 prisoners have been released as part of an amnesty
to mark the ninth anniversary of the Islamic revolution.
   IRNA said the detainees released in various cities in Iran were
``repentant'' and had been pardoned.
   It did not say what they were jailed for or on what day they
were released.
   Iran has already reported freeing more than 1,000 other
prisoners following the anniversary of the Islamic seizure of power
on Feb. 11, 1979.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court said Monday it will judge
the validity of a federal law that lets independent counsels
investigate alleged crimes by high-ranking executive branch
officials.
   The court also rejected the latest appeal of one target of such
an investigation _ Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L. North.
   The court's decision, expected by July, will resolve a major
constitutional dispute and will affect the criminal conviction of
former White House aide Michael K. Deaver and the rejuvenated
investigation of ex-Justice Department official Theodore B. Olson.
   The decision also could affect other investigations by special
prosecutors appointed under the law.
   The justices allowed special prosecutor Alexia Morrison to
resume her investigation of Olson, raising the possibility that
grand jury indictments could be handed down before the high court's
ruling.
   A federal appeals court ruled that the Watergate-era law
creating independent counsels impermissibly gives presidential
appointment powers to the federal courts. The appeals court had
derailed Morrison's investigation.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington ruled, by a 2-1 vote last month, that the independent
counsel provisions of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 were an
unconstitutional encroachment of the exclusive power of the
president to enforce criminal laws.
   Under the law, a special court appoints independent counsels, or
special prosecutors, at the request of the attorney general to
investigate alleged criminal wrongdoing.
   Morrison is investigating allegations that Olson, a former
assistant attorney general, lied to Congress in 1983 during a
dispute over the Environmental Protection Agency's cleanup program
for toxic waste.
   The appeals court ruling followed a challenge by Olson and
others to Morrison's authority to subpoena their testimony before a
federal grand jury.
   The Jan. 22 ruling could jeopardize last month's perjury
conviction of former presidential aide Michael K. Deaver for lying
to a grand jury and to a House subcommittee that investigated his
lobbying activities.
   But the appeals court ruling in Olson's case is not expected to
interfere with the work of Lawrence E. Walsh, the independent
counsel investigating the Iran-Contra arms and money affair.
   The Supreme Court last month refused to consider North's
challenge to the parallel appointment Walsh accepted last year from
the Justice Department.
   North was fired as a White House aide after his role in the
diversion of money from secret Iranian arms sales to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels was revealed.
   A different three-judge panel of the appeals court in Washington
upheld the constitutionality of the backup appointments last year.
   Independent counsel James C. McKay, who is prosecuting former
presidential aide Lyn C. Nofziger on illegal lobbying charges, also
accepted a backup appointment.
   But Morrison and Whitney North Seymour, the independent counsel
who prosecuted Deaver, did not accept backup appointments.
   The North appeal acted on Monday was from a ruling that barred
him from halting Walsh's investigation by challenging its legality
in a civil lawsuit.
   The appeals court ruling that dismissed North's lawsuit said,
``Potential criminal defendants cannot, by bringing ancillary
equitable proceedings, circumvent federal criminal procedure.''

   Democratic presidential candidate Michael
Dukakis derided President Reagan's anti-terrorism policies on
Monday as worthless in light of the Iran-Contra affair, prompting
Reagan's spokesman to retort that candidates shouldn't make a
hostage situation a political issue.
   The Massachusetts governor, using the White House as a backdrop
after a meeting of the National Governors' Association with Reagan,
issued a stinging critique of the administration's Iran-Contra
involvement and the problems it might pose for the next president.
   Asked how he would respond to the latest hostage-taking, Dukakis
said, ``You never, ever make concessions to terrorism. If you ever
do it, then your policy is worthless. And that's what we did.''
   Referring to the sale of arms to Iran during secret negotiations
to free American hostages, Dukakis said, ``We'll be living with the
consequences of what happened for a long time.''
   His remarks came as the administration struggled to deal with
the kidnapping of another American in Lebanon, Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins, a Marine detailed to a U.N. truce-monitoring force.
   Queried by reporters, Dukakis said he would have ``a much
tougher, and much more consistent anti-terrorist policy'' than
Reagan.
   ``What happened in 1985 was devastating ... to our ability to be
credible when it came to putting together a very tough,
no-compromise policy on terrorism,'' he said.
   ``This is international crime, pure and simple, and you fight it
the way you fight crime _ with tough police work, with effective
undercover operations, with military operations against terrorist
base camps if necessary,'' the governor added.
   Dukakis' remarks brought a quick rebuke from presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``I think it's very dangerous to make terrorism a political
issue, especially when you're talking about specific episodes,''
Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman asserted that past experience has shown that
``there are any number of aspects to individual hostage-takings
that can be exacerbated by political talk or media talk or
political statements.''
   ``I would simply urge caution on everyone's part, including
political candidates,'' he said.
   Besides hitting Reagan's performance on terrorism, the
Massachusetts governor took advantage of the attention of the White
House press corps to question Reagan's approach to welfare reform
and child care.
   On a strictly political topic, he also said he was heading into
Tuesday's South Dakota and Minnesota contests aiming to prove he
has wider appeal than shown by his New Hampshire primary victory.
   ``If I can do well out there, that will be proof positive this
is a national campaign, and a national candidacy,'' he said, adding
that he hoped victories there would be a boost for the multiple
showdowns March 8 on Super Tuesday.
   Dukakis joked that he'd used the governors' visit to look the
White House over as a possible residence. ``No commuting, don't
even have to take the street car, just walk to work _ it's
terrific,'' he said with a broad smile.
   As dozens of camera and microphone-toting technicians and
correspondents crowded around him on the White House lawn, Dukakis
even offered to ``meet with the press two or three times a week''
if he were elected.
   And to reporters' delight, he dangled the option of Hawaiian
winter vacations before the oft-traveling pack.
   It would be tough to top Santa Barbara,'' one correspondent
taunted when the subject came up, noting the lush California resort
town near Reagan's vacation ranch.
   ``How about Cape Cod _ what do you think?'' asked the
Massachusetts governor with a grin.
   Mild murmurs of approval were made. Then, a query about his
winter vacation plans.
   ``The Berkshires,'' Dukakis replied firmly, only to be met by
silence.
   Sensing a need to offer a new slant on the subject, the
candidate quickly shifted gears.
   ``On the other hand, my wife expressed a preference for Maui the
other day,'' he offered.
   Cheers erupted from the crowd.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Evan Mecham's criminal trial on
charges of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan was delayed by a
judge Monday until March 22.
   The delay from the original March 9 trial date gives both sides
time to handle pretrial motions and answers, said Judge Michael
Ryan of Maricopa County Superior Court.
   Mecham also faces a May 17 recall election and a Feb. 29
impeachment trial by the state Senate.
   He is charged with six counts of fraud, perjury and filing false
documents in connection with a $350,000 campaign loan made in
October 1986 by Tempe develper and attorney Barry Wolfson. Willard
Mecham, his brother's 1986 campaign treasurer, faces three similar
counts.
   The governor and brother did not answer reporters' questions
when they entered and left the courtroom.
   Assistant Attorney General Michael Cudahy told Ryan he needed
more time to reply to defense motions. Cudahy also complained that
attorneys for the Mechams had not yet made required pretrial
disclosures, including lists of witnesses and exhibits.
   Cudahy said the Mechams' lawyers made ``more or less a
grandstand play'' by saying in court Monday that they were ready to
go to trial when they had not made the disclosures.
   The governor's lawyer, Murray Miller, said those disclosures
would be made this week.
   Ryan said he would schedule a hearing later on several defense
motions to remand the charges to the state grand jury, dismiss some
of the counts and require grand jurors and the prosecutor to submit
to questioning.
   Willard Mecham's lawyer, Michael Scott, has claimed in court
papers that Attorney General Bob Corbin's office manipulated the
grand jury process by having most testimony presented to a state
grand jury that met last fall, but holding the matter over for a
new grand jury which indicted the Mechams on Jan. 5.
   Corbin's office has contended, however, that the matter was
given to a new grand jury to avoid possible bias because three
members of the previous grand jury had signed petitions to recall
Mecham.
   Miller told Ryan that he was prepared to have both the criminal
and impeachment trials simultaneously although he indicated he may
ask a court to delay the Senate's impeachment trial. However, he
did not say when or where he would file such a motion.

<TEXT>
   Deborah Raffin had hoped for an anonymous
vacation in the People's Republic of China, but on her first day
there, throngs of Chinese ran up to her shouting, ``nightmare,
nightmare.''
   ``It's funny now, but it wasn't funny then,'' the actress said
recently. ``At first I thought it was because of my blonde hair and
obvious Western looks. Then I started to think that maybe I was
somebody's idea of a nightmare.''
   What actually caused the commotion was the Chinese people
recognizing her from the 1976 film, ``Nightmare in Badham County,''
in which she played a hitchhiker hounded by a lecherous sheriff. It
was a major box office hit in China.
   That visit six years ago began a love affair between Miss Raffin
and China, and she continued to return, recently to film the $20
million miniseries, ``Noble House,'' airing this week on NBC. She
plays a tough corporate officer who falls for the head of a trading
house, played by Pierce Brosnan.
   ``I had been to Hong Kong about a dozen times before the filming
and took the role as an excuse to go back,'' Miss Raffin said. ``I
feel very comfortable there. It's like the Manhattan of Asia, so
colorful and romantic with a tremendous energy level. It's a world
few of us in the United States know anything about.''

<TEXT>
   A deadly mix of rock and mud
threatened hillside homes during a fourth day of violent rains
Monday which have killed at least 75 people in the Rio area.
   The new danger slowed efforts to reach a buried roomful of
children and prompted the mayor to order hundreds of residents to
``get out while there's still time.''
   Mud-caked survivors flashed thumbs-up signs as they were carted
away on stretchers, while rescuers moved gingerly about the
unstable hillsides in the city.
   Scores have died there since the heavy rains began triggering
sporadic floods and mudslides on Friday.
   Civil defense officials warned that huge boulders and
rain-loosened earth on many hillsides presented an extreme risk of
new avalanches, particularly in the crowded shantytown slums that
line the hills.
   Mayor Roberto Saturnino Braga went on television to order
hundreds of slum dwellers to evacuate their high-risk homes.
   ``Get out while there's still time. You may lose your
possessions, and we regret that. But we're talking about your
lives,'' Braga said.
   In the working-class north Rio district of Abolicao, rescue
workers used sledgehammers and spikes to break up concrete slabs of
a three-story apartment building that collapsed under a mudslide
Sunday night, killing at least nine residents.
   Fourteen people were taken alive from the rubble. Television
crews broadcasting live from the site showed survivors covered with
yellow-brown mud flashing thumbs-up signs as they were borne away
on stretchers.
   Civil defense spokeswoman Sonia Hadid said workers expected to
find as many as 11 bodies under the rubble.
   ``There was a children's party going on in one of the apartments
when it collapsed, so we don't know how many were in there,'' Ms.
Hadid said by telephone.
   In the Santa Teresa district near downtown Rio, 80 firemen
searched for bodies under the debris of a hillside clinic for the
elderly that was hit by a mud avalanche late Friday. A three-story
pavillion of the clinic collapsed and at least 11 patients died.
   Rescue efforts were slowed by rain and by a warning from
engineers that a new mudslide could occur at any moment in Santa
Teresa.
   ``They have to work carefully, using blowtorches and sledges,
removing the metal, concrete and wood. When it starts to rain, they
stop. Otherwise the whole hillside could come down,'' Ms. Hadid
said.
   The spokeswoman said the death toll of 75 included only bodies
that had reached the morgue and ``the final total certainly will be
higher.''
   The number of dead varied almost daily as civil defense
authorities struggled to get a clear picture of the tragedy's human
toll.
   Nearly 9,500 were without homes, a drop from previous days
because some flood victims began moving back to their dwellings.
   State health officials began a massive vaccination campaign
against tetanus and leptospirosis, a sometimes fatal infection
caused by water contaminated with rat urine and droppings. Earlier
reports indicated erroneously that leprosy was feared.
   Public service messages on radio and television urged people not
to walk barefoot through flood water and to boil their drinking
water or treat it with chlorine.
   Braga declared a state of public calamity in Rio and estimated
the damage at $150 million.
   The weather bureau said the unusually heavy rain was caused by
an antarctic cold front. The forecast was for more rain and gradual
clearing by Wednesday.
   Earlier this month, 207 people died in flooding and mudslides
around the state and 13,000 were left homeless.

   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., on Monday
endorsed Bob Dole for president, saying the Senate Republican
leader ``is a common sense conservative and is the most electable
of all the candidates.''
   Thurmond, the most senior GOP senator, endorsed Dole at a
Capitol Hill news conference. In so doing, he broke with other
South Carolina Republicans, including Gov. Carroll Campbell, who
have endorsed Vice President George Bush. Lee Atwater, Bush's
campaign director, is from South Carolina and has helped him get
support there.
   The South Carolina Republican primary is on March 5.
   Thurmond, who ran for president himself in 1948, declined to say
why he considered Bush less electable than Dole. He would not
criticize any of the candidates, he said.
   Dole was campaigning Monday in Minnesota and did attend the
announcement.

   Presidential candidate Michael Dukakis dangled
the option of winter trips to Hawaii before the White House press
corps Monday in a joking effort to endear himself to the
journalists.
   After he and other governors met with President Reagan, Dukakis
talked with reporters on the White House lawn and was told that
members of the press corps tell each other to ``vote your
vacation'' in any presidential contest.
   ``Got to top Santa Barbara,'' taunted one correspondent, noting
the lush California resort town near the ranch where Reagan has
often vacationed.
   ``How about Cape Cod _ what do you think?'' asked the
Massachusetts governor.
   Mild murmurs of approval and a query about winter vacations

<HEAD>Professionals Better at Selecting Nominees, Tower Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Professional politicians do a better
job of selecting qualified presidential nominees than the current
year-long system of primary elections, former Sen. John Tower says.
   Tower added that televised presidential debates are no better
than ``East Texas hog-calling contests.''
   The current system is a ``very, very imperfect way to select a
national candidate,'' Tower said in comments Sunday at a convention
of the National Utility Contractors Association.
   In the past, he said, ``The smoke-filled room screened out the
candidates who were least competent.''
   Tower, a Republican, said today's system can result in a nominee
who has the best commercials and who articulates his ideas best,
but who may not be the best president.
   He also criticized the news media, saying, ``I don't think the
mass media are capable. You don't get a balanced assessment from
sensational press stories. The mass media have become too strong.
On the whole, the media are consumed with an arrogance of power.''

<HEAD>Moral Majority President Sees Fallout from Swaggart Admission</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Moral Majority said Monday
that television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart's problems will likely
have a negative impact on the Republican presidential campaign of
former television preacher Pat Robertson.
   Jerry C. Nims, president of the conservative lobbying group,
said Swaggart's tearful confession and his stepping down from his
own TV ministry Sunday will not affect Robertson's core of
supporters.
   However, the Swaggart controversy might change the minds of
supporters who had been leaning toward the Republican hopeful.
   ``He (Robertson) has a large base of support'' that wouldn't be
affected by the fall of a televangelist, Nims told a news
conference called by a group of conservative organizations on
another subject. ``But it might have an impact outside,'' he said.
   The Moral Majority president said Robertson's core of followers
remains strong, but he may ``well lose some of the fringe''
supporters.
   Nims noted that the minsters who have fallen in the past year,
including Jim Bakker _ are members of the charismatic group, which
differs from Moral Majority and Robertson followers.
   ``For much of our constituency, it does not have an impact,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Expulsion is Only Appropriate Sanction for Biaggi, Committee Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Mario Biaggi's violation of House ethics
constituted ``criminal conduct of a most serious nature going to
the heart of his representational responsibilities'' and warranted
expulsion, the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct
said in a report released Monday.
   The committee, which recommended Thursday that Biaggi, D-N.Y.,
be expelled from the seat he has held for 20 years, explained why
it had elected to exercise its most serious punishment.
   ``The facts and circumstances giving rise to the violations,
being of the most serious nature, warrant the imposition of the
most stringent sanction available to the House of
Representatives,'' the 148-page report said.
   ``Accordingly, the committee submits that expulsion is the only
sanction appropriate to the violations committed by Representative
Biaggi.''
   Biaggi was not in his office Monday, but he said Thursday that
he intended to vigorously fight the expulsion recommendation.
   Biaggi, 70, was convicted in September of illegally accepting a
paid Florida vacation from Meade Esposito, the former Brooklyn,
N.Y., Democratic leader. Esposito was seeking government help for
Coastal Dry Dock and Repair Co., a financially troubled Brooklyn
shipyard that owed $280,000 in premiums to Esposito's insurance
brokerage firm.
   Biaggi was also convicted of illegally crossing state lines to
accept the gratuity and obstructing justice by trying to influence
how Esposito answered the FBI's questions. He was sentenced to 2{
years in prison and a $500,000 fine, and is free pending appeal.
   The ethics committee concluded that Biaggi violated rules
against discrediting the House; accepting impermissible gifts from
a person or organization with a direct or indirect interest in
legislation; failing to report a gift worth $250 or more on his
financial disclosure form; and accepting a favor or benefit that
might be construed as influencing the performance of government
duties.
   After reviewing evidence from Biaggi's trial, the committee
``found that the offenses for which Representative Biaggi was
convicted involved criminal conduct of a most serious nature going
to the heart of his representational responsibilities.''
   The committee's resolution to expel Biaggi must be approved by
two-thirds of the 435-member House to take effect. The matter may
be taken up on the floor at any time, now that the committee report
has been released.
   If the resolution passes, Biaggi would be the second congressman
expelled from the House since the Civil War. Rep. Michael ``Ozzie''
Myers, D-Pa., was ousted in 1980 after his conviction in the Abscam
bribery scheme.
   The committee report also includes a transcript of its closed
Dec. 17, 1987, meeting, at which Biaggi pleaded for leniency and
declared, ``I am incorruptible.''
   Biaggi argued that the vacation he took, at a Florida health
spa, was ``hospitality'' from Esposito, a friend of 40 years, not a
gratuity.
   Placing the value of the vacation at about $3,000, Biaggi asked
rhetorically, ``Mario Biaggi is going to compromise himself for
$3,000? I wouldn't compromise myself for $100,000.''
   Biaggi also said he did not know that Esposito had business with
Coastal until a bugged telephone conversation on June 2, 1986, more
than a year after the Florida vacation.

<HEAD>Nine-Member Court Will Hear Second Round of Arguments in Two Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At full strength with the addition of Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy, the Supreme Court said Monday it wants to hear
a second round of arguments in two cases already under study.
   The unusual move _ having lawyers twice argue a case before the
justices during one court term _ could mean that Kennedy's
tie-breaking vote is needed to resolve the two cases.
   At issue in one is whether defense contractors may be forced to
pay damages for on-duty accidents involving members of the military.
   The court is deciding whether to reinstate a $725,000 award to
the family of a Marine helicopter co-pilot who died in a 1980 crash
in the Atlantic Ocean near Virginia Beach, Va.
   A jury awarded the damages to the family of David Boyle, who
drowned on April 27, 1983, in the crash of the CH-53 helicopter.
But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the award
against the helicopter manufacturer, Sikorsky Aircraft, and its
parent company, United Technologies Corp.
   The appeals court said Sikorsky, as a military contractor, was
shielded from being sued because the Navy approved of the
helicopter's allegedly negligent design. The justices heard
arguments in the case Jan. 12.
   The second case, which the court first heard Jan. 19 and will be
reargued sometime in April, involves the convicted killer of an
Oklahoma policeman.
   Prosecutors say Bobby Lynn Ross shot Elk City, Okla., Police
Sgt. Steve Mahan three times after the officer arrived at a motel
being robbed by Ross on Jan. 5, 1983.
   At issue is whether Ross' trial was tainted when the presiding
judge refused to disqualify ``for cause'' a potential juror who
said he would vote to impose the death penalty _ and would not even
consider a life sentence _ if Ross were convicted.
   The potential juror was excluded when Ross' lawyer used one of
nine ``peremptory challenges.'' Ross contends his defense team
should not have been forced to expend one such challenge for that
juror.
   Both cases are to be decided by July.
   The court Monday refused to reconsider its 4-4 decision last
December striking down an Illinois law that could have made
abortions more difficult to obtain for some teen-agers.
   The justices rejected a request by Illinois Attorney General
Neil F. Hartigan that they restudy the law ``after the appointment
of a ninth justice.''
   Kennedy joined the court last Thursday, filling an eight-month
vacancy, but he did not participate in Monday's order denying
reconsideration in the Illinois case.
   He did join in the orders requiring reargument in the two other
cases.
   In seeking reconsideration, Hartigan emphasized the importance
of ``a decision by a full court'' in the case.
   The Illinois law required girls under 18 and still financially
dependent on their parents notify both parents 24 hours before
having an abortion.
   The law allowed a girl to avoid notifying her parents if she
could prove to a state judge that she was mature enough and
well-informed enough to make the decision on her own and that
notifying her parents would not be in her best interest.
   Doctors who failed to comply with the law's requirement faced
criminal prosecution.

   A moderate earthquake jarred some
Central California residents awake, but law enforcement officers
said Monday no damage was reported.
   The quake at 11:43 p.m. Sunday measured 3.9 on the Richter scale
of ground motion and was centered about 40 miles west-northwest of
Bakersfield, said Robert Finn, of the California Institute of
Technology's seismology laboratory in Pasadena.
   People felt it in the Taft and Bakersfield areas more than 100
miles north of Los Angeles and in San Luis Obispo County.
   ``We didn't get any reports of damage,'' San Luis Obispo
Sheriff's Sgt. Greg Slane said. ``It was mostly just inquiries from
people if there really was an earthquake.
   ``We assured them there was.''
   A Southern Pacific freight train crew in Santa Margarita, 10
miles north of San Luis Obispo, reported heavy tools shook during
the quake. Trains were slowed while workers inspected the tracks
for damage. None was found, officials in San Francisco said.

   A Soviet citizen was convicted of Nazi war crimes
Monday and sentenced to 15 years in jail, the official news agency
reported.
   Tass said Dmitri Maslo was found guilty of high treason and
other charges after a trial in the mining town of Selidovo in the
Ukrainian republic.
   During World War II, Maslo joined the police force in the
Ukrainian city of Krasnoarmeisk and ``voluntarily went over to the
side of Nazi invaders,'' Tass said. It said he arrested and
tortured Ukrainians and Jews and ``on many occasions he took part
in the shooting of peaceful civilians.''
   Maslo, who went on trial Feb. 9, also was accused of helping
kill prisoners in the Krasnoarmeisk jail in 1943 as Soviet forces
began liberating the area.
   He fled when the Nazis withdrew and settled in Khristinovka,
near the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, Tass said.

   Five people were killed and five others were
injured in a flurry of weekend gang-related shootings despite a
police sweep aimed at curbing street violence.
   Sixty officers swept through gang-infested south-central Los
Angeles during a special 16-hour campaign against gang members and
drug dealers Saturday and Sunday. They arrested more than 50 people
for crimes ranging from narcotics sales to concealed weapons to
grand theft auto, said Lt. Mark Leap.
   Despite the show of force, the violence was unrelenting.
   In one of the weekend killings, a man was shot by three
teen-agers on bicycles, said Sheriff's Deputy Gabriel Ramirez.
   In one especially flagrant gang shooting, four men in a car
shouted gang slogans and opened fire on about 50 people gathered in
front of a Taco Bell restaurant Sunday, police said. Four
teen-agers were wounded.
   The escalating street gang problem in Los Angeles became evident
last month when it stretched out of crime-ridden south-central Los
Angeles and reached into upscale Westwood Village, where a
27-year-old woman died when she got caught in gang crossfire.
   The strong police response to that shooting sparked an outcry in
less-affluent communities such as the south-central area, where
more than 100 people were killed in gang violence last year.
   Mayor Tom Bradley last week signed an ordinance giving the city
150 more officers, many of which will be used to battle gangs. The
City Council also approved an anti-gang project that will result in
up to 100 gang members in jail on drug charges each month, said
Deputy Police Chief Glenn Levant, 45, the department's
newly-appointed ``gang czar.''

   A teen-age boy whose father hired a hit man
through Soldier of Fortune magazine to kill his mother fought back
tears Monday as he testified he feared a similar fate.
   Gary Wayne Black, 18, took the stand in the second week of a
federal court trial of a lawsuit filed by him and his maternal
grandmother, Marjorie Einmann.
   They are seeking $22.5 million from the Boulder, Colo.-based
magazine, accusing the self-proclaimed ``Journal for Professional
Adventurers'' of negligence for running an ad that led to the
slaying of Sandra Black.
   The ad, placed by John Wayne Hearn, brought him into contact
with Robert Black.
   Black is on Texas' death row for paying Hearn $10,000 to carry
out the killing of his wife. Hearn is serving three life terms in
Florida for that and two other slayings.
   Gary Black, a high school senior who found his mother shot to
death in their Bryan home three years ago Sunday, described her as
understanding and kind.
   ``She just was the worst person I could lose,'' he said.
   Mrs. Einmann, who also testified Monday as plaintiffs completed
their case against the magazine, said her grandson was so
devastated by the killing he not sleep alone or enter his house
alone for a year and a half afterward.
   He constantly twitched, and suffered from severe headaches, she
said.
   During treatment by state mental health counselors, the boy told
how much he feared his father, she said.
   ``They said his mind was so damaged. ... He feared if someone
could get into his own home to kill his own mother, someone could
get into my house to kill him.''
   ``If he could hire someone out of Soldier of Fortune magazine to
kill my mother, he could hire someone out of Soldier of Fortune
magazine to kill me, too,'' Gary Black said of his father.
   Hearn's ad appeared in four issues of the magazine in late 1984,
offering services of former Marine and Vietnam veterans and weapons
specialists with jungle warfare expertise for ``high-risk
assignments'' in the United States or overseas.
   A criminologist, Park Dietz, testified last week the reference
to ``high-risk'' meant the person placing the ad was willing to
commit a crime.
   Attorneys for the magazine do not deny the ad brought Hearn and
Black together, but insist publisher Robert Brown had no way of
knowing the ad was for illegal activity.
   Brown has testified he would have halted the classified ads for
personal services if he had known they were linked to crimes.
   Defense attorneys planned to call several witnesses to testify
for the magazine's value as a defense journal.
   Among them would be Col. Charles Beckwith, who led the Army's
Delta Force in the unsuccessful attempt in 1980 to rescue the
American hostages in Iran.

   Navy Secretary James H. Webb resigned today,
saying he is ``unable to support'' Defense Secretary Frank
Carlucci's decision to abandon the goal of a 600-ship fleet and
criticizing Carlucci's leadership in the Pentagon.
   ``This building needs to be led,'' Webb told reporters. ``It
needs leadership. It needs some vision. I'm saying that if I had a
piece of advice to give to Secretary Carlucci, it would be to spend
a lot more time with the top leaders in this building.
   ``He's been spending a lot of time with the State Department and
a lot of time on the Hill. I think they (Pentagon leaders) need to
feel his vision and to understand what he believes in.''
   Webb, 42, has held the job less than a year. A highly-decorated
Marine veteran of Vietnam combat, he was the author of ``Fields of
Fire,'' a best-selling novel about the war in Vietnam.
   In his letter of resignation to President Reagan, Webb said he
decided to leave because he could not support the fiscal 1989
Pentagon budget proposal crafted by Carlucci.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``Secretary
Carlucci is having to make some very difficult adjustments in the
Pentagon to accommodate budgetary reductions. Secretary Webb
indicates he is unable to operate under these constraints, but I
know the president feels he has given very valuable service to the
country, and will work with Secretary Carlucci to find a
replacement as soon as possible.''
   Referring to the internal budget debate that led to last week's
submission of the fiscal 1989 budget, Webb wrote to Reagan:
   ``On three separate occasions, the uniformed and civilian
leadership of the Navy Department provided the secretary of defense
with proposed cuts totaling the amount required to meet the budget
reduction, but which also would preserve the cherished goal of your
administration to rebuild our Navy to a minimum of 600 ships.''
   Because those recommendations ``were rejected by your secretary
of defense, I am unable to support him personally or to defend this
amended budget during budget deliberations (on Capitol Hill),''
Webb concluded.
   ``Consequently, I find it necessary to resign from my position
as secretary of the Navy.''
   ``This (budget cutting) is not being done according to a
strategy,'' Webb told reporters in his Pentagon office.
   Webb, who assumed the post as the Navy's top civilian leader
just April 10, said his concerns focused on a decision by Carlucci
to propose the early retirement and mothballing of 16 Navy frigates.
   The Navy had to cut $12 billion from its original fiscal 1989
budget plan, but still could have kept those ships by assigning
them to the Naval Reserve instead of consigning them to mothballs,
Webb continued.
   Without those frigates, Webb said there was no way the Navy
could build to 600 warships in fiscal 1989, as originally planned.
Indeed, despite the optimistic predictions of other Pentagon
officials, the decision means the Navy will never reach the
600-ship mark, he added.
   ``And one of the sad things about this, this was one of the few
goals of the Reagan administration that was really obtainable, at
pretty low cost,'' Webb added.
   Webb, one of the youngest men to ever become Navy secretary, is
a Naval Academy graduate.
   He came to the Pentagon in 1984 when Caspar W. Weinberger was
the defense secretary, assuming the post of assistant defense
secretary for reserve affairs. Webb had resigned that position and
was preparing to leave government service in early 1987 when the
president asked him to replace John F. Lehman, the first Navy
secretary of the Reagan administration.
   In his meeting with reporters, Webb declined to speculate on why
Carlucci had insisted that ships be retired when that step _ in
Webb's view _ wasn't required.
   Pentagon leaders should always be concerned about ``hollow
forces'' that aren't properly manned, but the Navy could have
reached the 600-ship mark without giving up readiness, Webb
insisted.
   The Navy secretary said he had wrestled with his concerns for
some time but didn't make a final decision to resign until Sunday.
   Webb said he had not spoken to Carlucci today, but had sent him
a copy of his letter to Reagan.
   Carlucci, in a written personal statement, said today he had
learned of Webb's decision ``with regret.''
   ``I wish him well in his future endeavors,'' Carlucci said. ``He
has earned our respect and gratitude for his service to our nation
both in uniform and as a civilian leader within the Defense
Department.''
   The Pentagon, in a companion statement, said the recent budget
debate ``has been one of the most painful in history.''
   ``The compromises have not been easy for anyone, and we regret
the fact that the secretary of the Navy appears to have found
himself unable to defend the department's decisions. Under the
circumstances, he has done the honorable thing.''

   The 70-year-old reputed underboss of the Gambino
crime family was sentenced Monday to 15 years in prison and fined
$820,000 for a racketeering conviction.
   Joseph Armone, of Brooklyn, was convicted Dec. 22 of
racketeering conspiracy involving extortion, bribery and illegal
interstate travel to commit bribery.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein said he sentenced Armone
to prison despite his advanced age because he was convinced Armone
was a high-ranking member of the crime family.
   Weinstein also cited Armone's lengthy criminal record, which he
said began when the defendant was 15 years old.
   Armone had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years for the most
serious charge, racketeering.
   According to the prosecution, Armone was elevated from capo to
underboss after he was indicted in 1986. It was also alleged that
Armone was observed meeting with reputed Gambino boss John Gotti
during the trial.
   Armone was jailed at the time of his conviction after he refused
to renounce any organized crime ties as a condition for his release
from detention. On Monday, Armone made a brief statement to
Weinstein in which he said he had not meant any disrespect to the
court in refusing the offer but that he turned it down because he
was worried about ``his rights''
   Prior to sentencing, defense attorney Mark Krasnow said Armone
had ``paid his dues to society'' for his previous convictions and
charged that his client had been entrapped by the government.
   Prosecutor Douglas Grover, a special attorney with the Justice
Department's Organized Crime Strike Force, said Armone had been
convicted of ``serious and compelling'' crimes and of being a
leader in the Gambino family. his life,'' Grover said.
   One of the bribery charges accused Armone and one of his
co-defendants, Joseph N. Gallo, of unsuccessfully plotting to give
a $20,000 bribe so that Gallo's son would be transferred from a
state prison, where he was then being held, to a federal prison,
where presumably he would receive better treatment.

and released by his captors Monday:
   I, William Higgins, in order to get me released, these demands
have to be met:
   One, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from all occupied
territories in Lebanon.
   Two, the release of all detained mujahedeen (holy warriors),
Lebanese and Palestinians, from Khiam prison and from all other
prisons inside the Zionist regime in occupied Palestine.
   Three, stopping U.S. intervention in Lebanon and stop sending

   Winds gusting up to 56 mph blasted gravel and
other debris into the world's tallest building Monday, and 90 of
the Sears Tower's windows cracked or shattered, officials said.
   There were no reports of injuries from falling glass, said
police and officials of Sears, Roebuck and Co., which has its
corporate headquarters in the building.
   Police cordononed off the streets surrounding the 110-story
building during the working rush hour, and planned to keep one
closed as a precaution throughout the day.
   ``There are people in the process of boarding up windows and
removing cracked windows,'' said Gordon Jones, a Sears spokesman.
   The windows, 5 feet wide and 8 feet tall, began shattering and
cracking at about 3:30 a.m. when gusts of up to 56 mph were
recorded in the area, said Ernest Arms, another spokesman for Sears.
   Jones and Arms said it appeared that one or more windows was
broken by debris, perhaps pebbles from nearby roofs, and the others
were broken as pieces came down.
   However, Jones said, ``We don't really know _ it happened in the
dark.''
   Jones said company officials did not have a damage estimate. All
the cracked or broken windows were located between the 50th and
88th floors of the 1,454-foot building, said Arms.
   Five windows were broken during high winds in April 1984, he
said.

<HEAD>Priest Says Shooting Victim Was Harassed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former parish priest of an
Irish nationalist who was shot dead from a British army observation
tower said Monday the victim was harassed by police and soldiers
for at least five years.
   The Rev. Brendan McHugh said Aidan McAnespie, 23, had to cross
into the Irish Republic every day to his job and was harassed
constantly at the army checkpoint.
   ``We complained time out of number to the police and military,
but no action was ever taken. Life for the poor man had just become
unbearable,'' McHugh told reporters.
   The army said it ``deeply regrets'' the shooting Sunday. A
spokesman said McAnespie was hit by a bullet fired from an
observation post about half a mile from the frontier in County
Tyrone.
   Police said the soldier involved was in military custody and an
investigation was being conducted. The soldier was not identified
and police would not comment on the priest's allegations.
   Relatives said McAnespie was walking to a regular weekly Gaelic
football game in Aughnacloy, the County Tyrone village where he
lives.
   Francis Molloy, a local councilman, said McAnespie was an
election worker for Sinn Fein, legal political arm of the outlawed
Irish Republican Army. The IRA denied he was among its members and
McHugh, the priest, said he was not involved in paramilitary
activity.
   ``He was never abused physically, just verbally, and his car was
often taken apart,'' he said. ``I don't know why he was singled out
for such treatment.
   ``The campaign against him must have been going on for at least
five years. Other young lads were also stopped, but Aidan appeared
to be getting special treatment.''
   Shootings of civilians by security forces have become rare
compared with the early 1970s, when Protestant-Catholic strife in
the British province was at its height.
   McAnespie's death came at a time of severe strain in Anglo-Irish
relations over other incidents involving police and the province's
Roman Catholic minority. The government in Dublin demanded a speedy
report.
   Britain provoked Irish outrage last month by saying it would not
prosecute policemen accused of perverting justice in the aftermath
of the killings of six unarmed Catholics in three incidents in late
1982.
   The strain was compounded by a British appeals court's refusal
to overturn the conviction of six Irishmen for two bombings that
killed 21 people in 1974. Irish officials believe the six are
victims of a miscarriage of justice.

   A federal judge Monday dismissed
drug-related charges against a woman whose boyfriend fell to his
death from a plane in 1985 with 77 pounds of cocaine and a
defective parachute strapped to his body.
   U.S. District Judge James H. Jarvis dropped the counts at the
request of Assistant U.S. Attorney James R. Dedrick, who last week
lost a bid to use statements mad by Rebecca Sharp to undercover
agents as evidence against her.
   Ms. Sharp, 32, a paralegal in Lexington, Ky., had been set to go
on trial March 1 on charges of conspiring with her boyfriend,
former Lexington narcotics officer Andrew Thornton II, to import
cocaine and of distributing the drug.
   Under the terms of the dismissal, Dedrick can seek another
indictment against Ms. Sharp. Meanwhile, her attorney said Ms.
Sharp was pleased at the movie and hopeful the case was over.
   Thornton's body was found on a Knoxville driveway Sept. 11,
1985. Bags of cocaine were tied to his waist, and federal
authorities have linked him to about 200 pounds of the drug found
in duffel bags scattered across northern Georgia for apparent later
retrieval. The empty plane was found crashed.
   A few days later, Drug Enforcement Agency special agent Kieran
Kobell, posing as an associate or representative of ``the
Colombians'' who supposedly provided Thornton the cocaine, went to
Lexington with a government informant, Bertram Gordon.
   Kobel said the two met with Ms. Sharp and she revealed an
intimate knowledge of the cocaine smuggling operation.
   Dedrick's motion did not specify why he wanted the charges
dismissed, but it seems likely the suppression of Ms. Sharp's
statements was a direct cause.
   U.S. Magistrate Robert P. Murrian ruled Feb. 12 that those
statements were made in fear.
   Kobell ``was playing the part of a Colombian or representative
of a Colombian or Colombians who had lost $12,000,000 worth of
cocaine,'' he wrote in upholding the motion to keep Ms. Sharp's
statements out of evidence.
   ``I believe that under the circumstances of this case, the
defendant (Ms. Sharp) had to have been in great personal fear for
her safety when she made the statements. ...,'' Murrian wrote. ``It
would have been smart from her point of view to promise that the
deal would go through, that the Colombians would not be `ripped
off' and that she would kill if necessary to see that happen.''
   Murrian also said Kobell threatened both Ms. Sharp and Fred
Partin, her attorney in Kentucky, according to Partin's testimony
at the suppression hearing. Partin is a former assistant U.S.
attorney.
   Kobell has denied threatening Ms. Sharp.

   Nine organizations, including the American
Academy of Pediatrics and the National Education Association,
announced formation Monday of a coalition to lobby on behalf of
children with AIDS.
   ``We need money from both government and private sources,'' said
Edward Connor, a member of the academy of pediatrics.
   Conner noted that about 80 percent of the known 839 cases of
children with AIDS in the United States were born to mothers who
are drug abusers themselves or sexual partners of drug abusers.
   ``If we could reach these prospective parents today, we could
stop this expanding problem in nine months,'' he said at a press
conference.
   But he acknowledged that drug abusers are the hardest group to
educate about the threat of AIDS and said more money will be needed
to pay for the kind of face-to-face contact that is required to
reach them.
   Rather than focus on a particular goal, representatives of the
nine organizations said they would engage in a ``generic'' effort
to make sure children are not forgotten as programs to combat AIDS
are formulated and implemented.
   Other members of the coalition: Children's Defense Fund,
American Psychological Association, National Association of
Community Health Centers, Child Welfare League of America, American
Nurses Association, National Association of Children's Hospitals
and Related Institutions and the Western Association of Children's
Hospitals.

   Sen. Paul Simon, who once said he'd
drop out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination if
he didn't come out of Minnesota or South Dakota with a victory,
said Monday he doesn't expect to carry either state but plans to
fight on anyway.
   ``I'm continuing to campaign all the way to Atlanta, period,''
the Illinois senator told reporters during an appearance at the
University of Minnesota.
   Simon also predicted that when the Democratic National
Convention convenes in Atlanta in July it would be ``not likely we
will have any one person with a majority.''
   On the eve of the Minnesota precinct caucuses and the South
Dakota primary, Simon was offering a new scenario for survival of
his financially troubled campaign.
   ``I have to say candidly it is unlikely I am going to win in
Minnesota or South Dakota,'' he said. ``I think we're going to do
respectably. I think we're going to do respectably on Super Tuesday
and then the whole thing, in a sense, starts over because I think
we're going to have a very scattered result after that.''
   He noted that the next big event after March 8, the day dubbed
Super Tuesday because 20 states will hold primaries or caucuses,
will be the primary in Illinois, his home state.
   ``I think we're going to have a new ballgame,'' he said.
   After his third-place finish in the New Hampshire primary last
week, Simon said he would drop out of the race if he didn't come up
with a victory in Minnesota or South Dakota.
   ``What changed my mind,'' he said, ``was an avalanche of support
from around the nation which said we want to have someone who
represents the party's progressive wing.''
   Asked on what he based his contention that he would do
``respectably'' in the South on Super Tuesday, Simon cited polls he
said showed him ``doing pretty well'' on a state-by-state basis.
   ``I haven't led in any of them, but I've been doing pretty well
so far,'' he said.
   During an earlier appearance at Gustavus Adolphus College in St.
Peter, Simon proposed that anyone signing up for welfare be
required to take a literacy test. If they can't read or write, they
would be required to take an adult literacy program, he said.
   ``We need to move massively on this,'' he said.

<HEAD>Heflin Supports Gore's Presidential Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Albert Gore Jr. won the support
Monday of Sen. Howell Heflin, a Southern conservative who said he
wanted to ``educate'' the presidential candidate to more
conservative or moderate views.
   ``He's not too far to the left, but I've got to try to bring him
to the middle a little bit,'' said Heflin, of Alabama. ``I'm going
to work on him.''
   Heflin appeared with his Senate colleague from neighboring
Tennessee at a news conference scheduled by the Gore campaign to
trumpet what they regarded as an endorsement by an influential and
respected Southern conservative lawmaker.
   Gore also used the news conference to renew attacks on
Democratic rivals Richard Gephardt, a Missouri congressman, for
inconsistency and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis for foreign
policy inexperience.
   Heflin's remarks, however, highlighted the difference between
the Alabama senator's conservative voting record in Congress and
that of Gore. Gore has positioned himself to the right of his
rivals on defense and foreign policy issues, but has a voting
record that critics say is more liberal than his rhetoric suggests.
   Heflin said Gore has common sense and a ``down-home centralist
philosophy.''
   But he acknowledged Gore was to the left of himself when he was
asked about how they have differed on such issues as military aid
to the Nicaraguan Contras and money for President Reagan's nuclear
defense shield program.
   ``I have a hope that I can educate him a little bit, and bring
him over a little bit more,'' Heflin said.
   Gore opposes military aid to the Contras, while saying he would
support some humanitarian aid, and has opposed money for Star Wars,
although he has said he would support some research consistent with
existing treaties.
   Gore had a rating of 70 in 1986 from the liberal Americans for
Democratic Action, meaning his votes on selected issues agreed with
that group's position 70 percent of the time. He had a rating of 9
from the conservative American Conservative Union. Heflin, by
contrast, had ratings of 25 from the ADA and 65 from the ACU.
   Heflin said he regarded Gore as the most electable of the
Democratic candidates and ``strong on national defense.''
   ``Al Gore is the only Democratic candidate in this race who can
carry the South in November,'' he said.
   ``His roots run deep in Southern soil, and he has never
forgotten rural America from whence he came,'' Heflin said.
   Gore renewed the criticism of his rivals, accusing Dukakis of
suggesting it was ``fine with him if the Soviet Union established a
client state in Central America, so long as they did not put Soviet
offensive weapons in that client state.'' Dukakis has sharply
denied making such a statement.
   ``It is another example of his total lack of experience in
foreign policy,'' Gore said.
   Gore repeated criticism of Gephardt for changing positions on
issues such as abortion, the minimum wage and taxes. But Gore
acknowledged he had voted in 1984 for legislation that had
mandatory production control provisions similar to the farm
proposals Gephardt now backs and Gore denounces as disastrous for
the economy.
   ``There is a difference between changing your mind on one or two
issues over a 12-year period, and having a wholesale change in
dozens and dozens of key positions,'' he said, referring to
Gephardt.
   He also said Gephardt's ``whole approach to the electorate is in
contrast to the approach during his career in the Congress.''
   Gore also campaigned in Maryland, one of the 20 states holding
Democratic primaries or caucuses March 8, where he said stopping
the flow of illegal drugs into the country would be a top priority
for his administration. He stopped at the Coast Guard's Curtis Bay
shipyard, which the Reagan administration has scheduled to close
and which he pledged to keep open.

<HEAD>Senate Asked to Ratify Law Enforcement Treaty With Canada</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan asked the Senate on Monday to
ratify a treaty with Canada that he said should help the two
countries prosecute terrorists, drug traffickers and other
criminals.
   The Treaty on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters was
signed by Reagan and Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney at
their meeting in Quebec City, Canada, on March 18, 1985. The White
House said submission was delayed while annexes to the pact were
worked out by the two nations.
   It is one of a series of such legal assistance treaties being
negotiated by the United States.
   Similar pacts have gone into force with Italy, the Netherlands,
Switzerland and Turkey.
   Others have been signed but not yet gone into force with
Colombia, Morocco, Mexico, Thailand, Belgium, the Bahamas and the
United Kingdom on behalf of the Cayman Islands.
   Reagan sent the treaty with Mexico to the Senate for
consideration just before his meeting with Mexican President Miguel
de la Madrid in Mazatlan, Mexico, on Feb. 13.
   In his message to the Senate, he said the treaty with Canada
``should be an effective tool to prosecute a wide variety of modern
criminals including members of drug cartels, `white-collar
criminals' and terrorists.''
   The treaty provides for the two countries to assist each other
in taking testimony or statements of witnesses; providing
documents, records and evidence; executing requests for searches
and seizures and serving documents.
   It also provides for assistance in proceedings relating to
forfeiture of the proceeds of crime, restitution for victims and
collection of fines.

<HEAD>Florida Officials Gird For Spring Break; Daytona The Reigning
Capital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This seaside town is girding for
another successful spring break, while former mecca Fort Lauderdale
faces defections to exotic resorts and uncertainty at home over
whether it should keep encouraging college students.
   The 1960 film ``Where The Boys Are'' established Fort Lauderdale
as the nation's spring break center, but Daytona Beach has taken
the lead in Florida recently.
   Daytona Beach will play host this year to about 500,000 young
vacationers between Feb. 28 and April 1, while Fort Lauderdale may
be lucky to attract the 200,000 that came last year, officials say.
   Not all of the defectors are going to Daytona Beach.
   In recent years, the Bahamas, Florida's Panhandle, Texas' South
Padre Island and the Mexican resorts in Cancun and Acapulco have
cultivated the free-spending students.
   ``I doubt if I have 100 reservations to Fort Lauderdale, but
probably 8,000 for Cancun,'' Rob Brown, president of Travel Turf
Tours in Bethlehem, Pa. told the Wall Street Journal last week.
   ``There's some talk about how Mexico's coming into prominence,''
Florida tourism division spokesman Raul Marcucci said Monday. ``It
started happening last year.''
   But with 16,000 hotel rooms along 23 miles of beach, Daytona
Beach is expecting a strong turnout.
   ``We know that, on an average, each student visiting Daytona
Beach spends between $325 and $400 here,'' said Evelyn Fine,
executive director of the Mid-Florida Research and Business Center
of Daytona Beach Community College. ``Assuming each dollar is spent
seven times in the local economy, my guess is we're looking at
about $130 million this year.''
   MTV and National College Television networks will broadcast live
from Daytona Beach over the peak March 20 weekend.
   Two breweries are sponsoring free concerts, a soft drink maker
is sending a portable dance club to motel parking lots, and
countless other national distributors will promote everything from
suntan lotion to peppermint schnapps, including tennis shoes and
do-it-yourself pregnancy tests.
   Tour promoters say Daytona Beach has become the spring break
mecca partly because Fort Lauderdale officials, weary of the
trouble that came with the collegians, have been cracking down.
   ``In the past five years, I've seen a gradual increase to
Daytona, just because of the strictness of the enforcement in
Lauderdale,'' said Ron Good, president of Campus Marketing Inc. in
Glen Ellyn, Ill. ``You can really kind of let loose in Daytona;
it's a little bit wilder.''
   Daytona Beach police jailed 270 people when an all-night,
rock-throwing melee broke out on the strip in 1975. But Fort
Lauderdale ran into even more trouble. A crackdown two years ago
resulted in 2,500 arrests.
   Across Florida, state officials this year are urging bar owners
to obey the law on the drinking age of 21.
   The Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco is presenting
workshops in traditional spring break cities to educate bar owners
and employees about Florida's drinking laws.
   Meanwhile, ``For sale'' signs have been sprouting in Fort
Lauderdale.
   ``Last year was a devastating year for a lot of the small
hotels, and some of these mom-and-pop hotels already are being
listed for sale,'' said real estate broker Max Sebastiani.
   While city officials emphasize family vacations, some merchants
are still rooting for the college students.
   ``There's only a small group that doesn't want the college
students,'' said ``Crazy Gregg'' Newell, former bar owner and
director of the Fort Lauderdale '88 Committee promoting spring
break. ``And they don't seem to be directly involved with beach
business.''

<HEAD>Brock Says Dole Plans To Take The Offensive On Tax Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bob Dole's presidential campaign manager said
Monday the Kansas senator intends to take the offensive on the
issue of taxes and may ``start pointing out how many times George
Bush has changed his position'' on the subject.
   Former Sen. Bill Brock also accused the vice president's
campaign of deliberate distortions of Dole's position that were
``demeaning to the political process.''
   Brock made his comments as aides said the campaign had hired new
producers for its television advertisements in the wake of Dole's
defeat by Bush in last week's New Hampshire primary.
   Officials said Michael Murphy and Alex Castellanos, who produced
a biographical videotape used late last year to introduce Dole to
the voters, would be joining the campaign. They will replace Don
Ringe.
   Dole was seen as damaged in New Hampshire by Bush's charge that
he couldn't be relied on to block tax increases, but Brock said the
vice president really distorted the record. He said Dole has said
he would veto any attempt to increase income tax rates, but was not
averse to closing certain loopholes that allow corporations to
reduce their tax bills.
   He said it was time to ``start pointing out how many times
George Bush has changed his position on taxes. Back in October he
said he was against any tax increase, a few days later he came out
and said well maybe. In November again he said, well I really don't
want to and then four days after that he said maybe we'll have to.''
   ``I don't think we're going to be on the defensive on this one.
I think we're going to be on the offensive,'' he said.
   Brock did not elaborate on the comments he said Bush had made.

<TEXT>
   Scandals surrounding two of the most
prominent ministers of the Assemblies of God may have created a
false impression that the church is riddled with discipline
problems, an official said Monday.
   The evangelical church, which counts more than 16 million
adherents worldwide and operates four colleges in Springfield, is
investigating the misconduct of Louisiana evangelist Jimmy
Swaggart. Officials say Swaggart has revealed an undisclosed
transgression. On Sunday, he tearfully stepped down from his
television pulpit.
   Another prominent television evangelist, the PTL's Jimmy Bakker,
lost his Assemblies of God credentials last year amid charges of
sexual misconduct. Swaggart was said to have been active in
uncovering that scandal and Bakker accused him of plotting to take
over PTL.
   `Those are the only two in our whole denomination that have that
kind of recognition,'' said church spokeswoman Juleen Turnage. ``So
people may feel that this is indicative of the Assemblies of God
denomination, and that is not true.
   ``We have over 30,000 credentialed ministers in the Assemblies
of God in the United States. At any given time, any given year,
fewer than one-half of 1 percent are ever called into discipline...
.''
   Mrs. Turnage said 12 areas of misconduct, ranging from doctrinal
aberrations to moral failure, call for disciplinary action.
   Mrs. Turnage said that, according to by-laws, the church's
Louisiana district has six months to complete its investigation of
Swaggart, though it is not expected to take that long.
   ``Now that he has confessed to the sin, it will be a matter of
the district meeting and forwarding a report and its
reccommendation to the executive presbytery here in Springfield,''
Mrs. Turnage said.
   Swaggart could be suspended or dismissed as an Assemblies
minister. In either case, he would have the option of entering a
rehabilitation program that would take at least two years, Turnage
said.
   Swaggart appeared before his congregation in Baton Rouge, La.,
Sunday to ask forgiveness from his family and church for an act he
did not describe publicly. He said he would not return to his
pulpit until the church investigation was completed.

<HEAD>27 People Killed In Two Days Despite State of Siege Emergency
Measures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers, guerrillas and a communist
leader were killed Monday despite emergency measures to curb one of
the bloodiest spates of violence the country has seen in three
decades.
   Ten peasants were singled out at a cockfight Sunday and shot by
men wearing black hoods, official reports said. In all, 27 people
have been killed in ambushes and assassinations over two days.
   President Virgilio Barco last month ordered a state of emergency
in an attempt to halt a wave of violence that has taken the lives
of more than 1,700 people in the last year. More than 120 people
have been killed this year.
   Most of those deaths came after Barco ordered army troops to
reinforce the police and increased jail terms for many violent
crimes, especially those committed by drug traffickers, leftist
guerrillas and paid assassins.
   Leftist guerrillas on Monday released seven mayors and two
reporters kidnapped earlier this month, the radio stations RCN and
Caracol said.
   Last week the rebels freed four mayors and a reporter they had
abducted. The guerrillas warned the mayors to budget more money to
help the poor and said they planned to blow up the country's main
oil pipeline again to keep oil from being exported.
   All 11 mayors and three reporters kidnapped were from towns in
northeast Colombia and all had been held for about a week.
   The kidnappings were by the National Liberation Army, known as
the ELN, which follows the political ideology of Cuba's Fidel
Castro. The rebel group has blown up the country's main oil
pipeline 13 times since Jan. 12.
   The latest victim of an apparent right wing death squad was
Carlos Gonima, a communist leader and assistant city attorney in
the northwest city of Medellin.
   A man riding on a motorcycle Monday shot and killed Gonima and
wounded his driver as Gonima headed for work at city hall, the
national police said in a news release.
   Gonima was a member of the leftist Patriotic Union party, which
has seen more than 500 of its members killed since it was organized
by former guerrillas in 1985.
   Leftist guerrillas ambushed an army patrol Monday, killing four
soldiers, the press office for the government of the state of
Antioquia said in a news release.
   In southwest Colombia guerrillas attacked the towns of Trujillo
and Caloto on Sunday and killed seven policemen, the army's 8th
Brigade said in a communique.
   Near Vistahermosa, in a jungled area in the southeast state of
Meta, 20 men wearing black hoods and carrying submachine guns
surrounded dozens of men attending a cockfight on Sunday, the
police said.
   Ten peasants were separated from the group and and shot as they
pleaded for their lives, the policer said. The police report did
not say who was suspected in the massacre. Drug traffickers have
long dominated large areas of the vast jungles in eastern Colombia.
   The traffickers kill people they suspect of being informers or
for refusing to let traffickers use their land for growing coca
trees, the source for cocaine.
   A broadcast reporter and a mother and her 15-month-old girl were
killed Sunday when gunmen opened fire on the reporter's car as the
three traveled along a highway near the western city of Cali, the
national police there said in a news release.
   The reporter, Belisario Zambrano, of the Cali station RCN, was
the 30th reporter to be slain in Colombia in 11 years. Zambrano
reported frequently on the government's efforts against narcotics.
   An Indian running for mayor in a small town in northwest
Colombia was assassinated Sunday.
   The victim, Jose Gilberto Motato, was the leading candidate for
mayor in the town of Riosucio, the mayor there, Alberto Diaz, said
in a broadcast report over the radio chain Caracol.
   Motato was the leader of an Indian movement for land reform and
other programs to help poor people in the area in the state of
Caldas.
   A city councilman, Rafael Ballesteros, was also killed Sunday in
Chicogorodo in the northwest state of Antioquia, the Bogota daily
El Tiempo quoted national police there as saying.
   The councilman was a member of the ruling Liberal party. About
100 members of Colombia's two dominate parties, the Liberal and the
Conservative, have been killed in the last year, with the army and
police blaming guerrillas for most of the killings.

   Exporters have sold China an additional
405,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices for delivery
in the 1987-88 marketing year, the Agriculture Department said
Monday.
   The sales, equal to almost 14.9 million bushels, were handled by
five companies: Cargill Inc., 135,000 tons; Nichimen America Inc.,
35,000; Bunge Corp., 35,000; Continental Grain Co., 100,000; and
Artfer Inc., 100,000.
   William L. Davis, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said the sales were part
of an authorized 1.2 million tons of wheat announced Feb. 5 under
the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Although no selling prices or other details were announced,
recent prices of wheat at farm points have averaged around $2.76
per bushel, indicating a U.S. farm value of about $41 million.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   China bought more than 4 million tons of wheat under previous
EEP arrangements, which allow exporters to sell commodities at
reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Davis said the bonuses due the five companies averaged $40.38
per ton, or about $1.10 per bushel of wheat. The bonuses will be
paid in the form of surplus commodities owned by the department's
Commodity Credit Corp.
   China has 495,000 tons remaining for use under the EEP
initiative announced on Feb. 5, he said.

   Four small bombs exploded in the

several cars but causing no injuries, police reported.
   They said at least one person climbed the fence around the Cook
Barracks before dawn and set six homemade devices on the ground
beside parked cars, but only four of the bombs went off.
   Police estimated the damage at $2,900. They said no individual

   Cook Barracks is located on the outskirts of Goeppingen in the

<TEXT>
   A 24-year-old mental patient who was not
considered dangerous walked away from a psychiatric center and
assaulted two relatives with a hatchet Monday, critically injuring
one of them, police said.
   The patient, Donald Rattray, was arrested at his home in the
city's Bronx section after he allegedly assaulted his
brother-in-law and an uncle at 5 a.m., said Sgt. Maurice Howard, a
police spokesman.
   Rattray was not considered dangerous by officials at Bronx
Psychiatric Center, to which he had been voluntarily admitted, said
Steven Osborne, a spokesman for the State Office of Mental Health.
   The brother-in-law, James Selvin, 30, was struck twice in the
head by the hatchet. He underwent surgery for his wounds and was
listed in critical condition at Jacobi Hospital, spokesman Susan
Mueller said.
   The uncle, Onis Rattray, 46, was in stable condition at the
hospital with cuts to the left hand. Both men lived with Rattray.
   Rattray was being held on charges of first-degree assault and
criminal possession of a deadly instrument, the hatchet.
   Rattray escaped from the psychiatric center Saturday evening,
Osborne said.
   ``He got into an unlocked janitor's closet on the second floor,
broke the window and escaped by tying a bunch of sheets together
and climbing from the second floor window,'' Osborne said.
   Rattray was voluntarily admitted to the hospital Feb. 16.,
Osborne said.
   Rattray had left the center without consent Feb. 8, the
spokesman said. Police were called to the family home Feb. 13
because Rattray was behaving irrationally, Howard said. He then
voluntarily readmitted himself.
   Patients who are voluntarily admitted to the hospital may
petition to leave at any time, but the approval process takes up to
three days, Osborne said.

<TEXT>
   A contingency plan to help prevent an
uncontrolled meltdown of the financial markets won the endorsement
Monday of the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee
and three other representatives.
   ``Our markets remain vibrant, but they are at the same time
delicate,'' Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., wrote in a letter to the
heads of three regulatory agencies. ``To permit them to function
without such a contingency plan courts unnecessary risk.''
   The letter was also signed by Reps. Edward Markey, D-Mass.,
chairman of the House telecommunications and finance subcommittee;
Norman Lent, R-N.Y., ranking minority member on the Energy and
Commerce Committee, and Matthew Rinaldo, R-N.J., ranking minority
member of the finance subcommittee.
   The letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity
Futures Trading Commission and Federal Reserve Board was prompted
by the Oct. 19 stock crash.
   ``The market decline ... was a wrenching and sobering experience
for the marketplace, market participants, regulators and those of
us in Congress with oversight responsibilities for our securities
markets,'' the letter said.
   It noted a recommendation by the General Accounting Office,
Congress' research arm, that regulators prepare a plan for dealing
with any similar emergency in the future.
   ``We believe that his recommendation ... should be implemented
as a concrete first step toward increased coordination among the
markets and restoration of investor confidence,'' the letter said.
   The congressmen asked the regulators to report to Congress by
March 25 on their efforts to craft a plan for coordinating
decisions by regulators and communicating them to the markets.
   They also asked the agencies to determine ``how much authority
the marketplaces should have to act independently of the regulators
in crisis circumstances.''
   The letter urged the agencies to agree on circumstances that
would allow relaxed interpretation of rules ``to facilitate market
liquidity, such as the interpretation of rules associated with
corporate stock repurchase plans,'' and on the provision of funds
to the economy by the Federal Reserve during times of market
turmoil.
   Congress, meanwhile, has been considering long-term measures to
ensure greater market coordination, ranging from a partial merger
of the SEC and CFTC to the creation of a new oversight body.

   A former top aide to Panamana's strongman Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega met under heavy guard Monday at the U.S.
Courthouse with prosecutors investigating the Iran-Contra affair.
   Jose I. Blandon presumably was questioned by the staff of
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh about Noriega's agreement to
train Nicaraguan rebels at the request of Lt. Col. Oliver North, a
former National Security Council official who is a target of
Walsh's investigation.
   Blandon, a former Panamanian intelligence official, was escorted
by heavily armed U.S. marshals as he arrived at the courthouse for
his 2{-hour meeting with members of Walsh's staff.
   A former top intelligence official in the Panamanian government,
Blandon was a key informant for federal prosecutors in Florida who
earlier this month obtained indictments charging Noriega with
taking at least $4.6 million in bribes to protect a major Colombian
drug ring.
   He is now in the protective custody of U.S. marshals.
   Blandon recently told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
that Noriega agreed to provide training for Nicaraguan
anti-Sandinista rebels after recieving a request from North in 1985.
   North sought the training on Panamanian soil because Congress
had banned direct U.S. military aide to the rebels, Blandon said.
   Blandon, who was fired last month as Panama's consul general in
New York, told congressional hearings earlier this month that North
met with Noriega on a yacht in June 1985 near the Panamanian city
of Balboa. The two met again four months later in Noriega's office,
Blandon said.
   During one of the meetings, Noriega offered to send Panamanian
soldiers to Nicaragua on ``terrorist sabotage'' missions but North
said he had no authority to accept such an offer, Blandon said.
North said, however, he would relay Noriega's offer to his
superiors at the National Security Council, Blandon testified.
   Blandon said Noriega also met in December 1985 with Rear Adm.
John M. Poindexter, who had just been appointed national security
adviser.
   Poindexter, who is also a target of Walsh's investigation,
resigned Nov. 24, 1986 following revelations that proceeds of U.S.
arms sales to Iran had been diverted to help buy arms for the
Contras.
   North was fired the same day that Poindexter submitted his
resignation to President Reagan.
   In his testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
Blandon said Noriega headed a ``criminal empire'' that sold drugs
with the knowledge of U.S. officials.
   Blandon also said one of Noriega's pilots flew a cargo of
cocaine to a ranch in Costa Rica owned by an American supporter of
the Contras.
   Noriega was indicted by federal grand juries in Miami and Tampa
earlier this month on charges that he accepted at least $4.6
million in payoffs from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel, said to
supply 80 percent of the cocaine shipped to this country.
   The indictments charge that Noriega accepted the payoffs in
return for laundering drug money, providing protection for cocaine
shipments and a haven for drug dealers. Noriega has strongly denied
any wrongdoing.

<HEAD>State, Local Government Workers Got Raises Averaging 4.9 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State and local government workers received
annual pay raises last year averaging 4.9 percent under collective
bargaining contracts with public employee unions, the Labor
Department said Monday.
   The pay increases were below the average 5.7 percent raises
received by state and local government employees in 1986. But the
workers still fared better last year than federal employees who got
a 3 percent pay increase and private sector workers whose wages
rose an average 3.3 percent.
   However, the Bureau of Labor Statistics noted that union
contracts in the public and private sectors differ significantly.
   State and local governments, for example, tend to have a higher
proportion of professional and white-collar workers. Union
contracts in the private sector, on the other hand, often include
lump-sum bonuses and cost-of-living adjustments excluded from the
wage calculations and usually absent in the public sector.
   The figures showed that local government workers with wage

   President Reagan cautioned the nation's
governors Monday against pressing for costly federal solutions to
the problems of welfare and child care.
   His remarks to the National Governors' Association were labeled
a disappointment by Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, a
Democratic presidential hopeful, who said Reagan should be backing
the governors' bipartisan welfare reform bill in the Senate.
   Reagan instead said he still strongly supports a less costly
Republican alternative that the House rejected two months ago.
   He also cautioned the governors to go slow on the issue of child
care, where both Democrats and Republicans in Congress are
proposing to expand federal support and subsidies for working
parents.
   ``Maybe it's my conservative bent, but I can't help but feel
uneasy sometimes,'' he told the governors gathered in the East Room
of the White House.
   Welfare programs have become ``a crippling poverty trap . ...
They keep the poor poor,'' Reagan said. ``Now, much of the push for
child care is designed to rectify the ills of earlier programs, and
many of these efforts are timely and good. But in this area, more
than any other, government should tread carefully.''
   Reagan said the alternative bill sponsored by House Minority
Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., would also give states freedom to
``develop your own ideas on child care.''
   Afterwards, Dukakis told reporters that he was very disappointed.
   ``Just one word from the president, I think, would get this bill
passed and done before the election, and get it off the table as a
partisan issue and get going,'' said Dukakis.
   ``He keeps telling us stories about California, and we're trying
to explain to him that the vast majority of people on welfare these
days are single mothers with young children, and it's a combination
of real training for real jobs, combined with day care, that makes
a difference,'' said Dukakis.
   Howard Baker, Reagan's chief of staff, said Reagan would veto
the House-passed welfare reform bill, but might approve a less
expensive measure still being shaped by the Senate Finance
Committee.
   The governors are pushing Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's bill,
which would toughen enforcement of child support, help states pay
for job training and make participation mandatory for most
unemployed adults. It would also provide some transitional Medicaid
and welfare benefits for families exiting the relief rolls for work.
   Moynihan, a New York Democrat, has 56 co-sponsors for his bill,
which would cost $2.3 billion over five years, compared to the $4.3
billion House bill, which would raise benefits and prohibit states
from denying welfare to families with both parents in the home.
   Baker said the Moynihan bill is not yet satisfactory, but he
held out the hope that Moynihan and Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., might
be able to fashion a compromise satisfactory to Reagan.
   Heinz, like Moynihan a member of the Senate Finance Committee,
has not introduced an alternative bill.
   Moynihan said in a telephone interview he heard two messages
from Reagan: ``One says that we're going to veto the House bill.
The other says we can try to work something out. I choose to
respond to the second message. There's too much at stake here. If
the president is interested in the subject, I'll be happy to work
with Sen. Heinz on anything.''
   Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y., who spearheaded passage of the House
bill, said in an interview, ``The time to do something about
welfare is now and the only person who seems opposed to it or
looking at the past is the president. We're not going to end child
poverty by leaving it to the states to do it. They don't have the
money.''
   Illinois Gov. James Thompson, a Republican, told reporters, ``I
think there's just a fundamental disagreement about how far to go
on welfare reform, especially with regard to cost. The governors
changed their mind, not the president.'' But despite that sticking
point, Thompson said, ``I still hold out hope that between the
administration and the Senate we'll get a bill.''
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a Democrat who is leading the
governors' push for welfare reform, emerged from the meeting and
said he felt Reagan was open to compromise.
   ``I am encouraged because basically their negotiating strategy
with everybody always is to take the hardest possible line and then
come off of it at the end,'' Clinton said.
   In the private meeting that followed Reagan's speech, Clinton
said, ``I told him we thought his bill was not a good bill and that
we were willing to make some changes in what came out of the House,
but we weren't going to get anywhere if his emissary kept saying,
`Well, we're going to veto whatever passes that we don't like.''
   Clinton said Reagan replied that ``he heard us ... and was
willing to work with us, so I think that's good.''
   Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt, a Republican, said he shared Reagan's
misgivings about the House-passed welfare bill. He said it ``might
really compound the problem'' by increasing federal funding without
giving states more control over welfare rules.
   What the states need is flexibility to allow them to ``gradually
remove (people) from welfare'' instead of terminating their
benefits as soon as they get a job, Hunt said.
   Later, the governors' committee on human resources heard
television's Captain Kangaroo, Bob Keeshan, plead for corporations
to start providing quality day care. ``I'm almost ashamed at times
to be an American,'' the children's performer and advocate said.
``We are half a century behind in addressing day care. We are going
to pay an enormous price a quarter-century down the line.''

   President Reagan on Monday designated Edward
J. Philbin, a former San Diego lawyer and law professor, as acting
chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission.
   Edward V. Hickey Jr., chairman of the commission, died in
January.
   Philbin, 55, has been a member of the commission since 1984.
Before that, he served three years as deputy assistant secretary of
defense for reserve affairs.
   Philbin joined the University of San Diego law faculty in 1970
and became assistant dean in 1973. He was also a partner in a San
Diego law firm specializing in civil litigation.
   He is a member of the Naval Air Reserve and served several tours

<HEAD>Nunn: INF Pact Faces Thorough Senate Review Before Ratification
Vote</HEAD>

   Sen. Sam Nunn said Monday the new U.S.-Soviet
nuclear arms control treaty won't be ratified until after his Armed
Services Committee the panel finishes its line-by-line examination
of the pact.
   That laborious process began Monday after the State Department
sent the Senate 31 volumes of documents involved in the long
negotiations which led to the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces
(INF) pact.
   ``It is very regrettable that we have to go through this,'' said
the Georgia Democrat, who emerged victorious in a fight with the
Reagan administration over the legal meaning of treaties.
   Nunn, chairman of the armed services panel, said he didn't know
how long it would take the committee to finish its work.
   The panel is one of three Senate committees considering the
treaty, which was signed in December by President Reagan and Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Ratification by the full Senate, which
requires a two-thirds vote, is expected later.
   The INF fight was based on a previous dispute between the
Democratic-controlled Congress and the Reagan administration over
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty and Reagan's Star Wars
anti-missile program.
   A number of Star Wars tests would be banned unless the United
States moved from the current ``narrow'' interpretation of the ABM
treaty to a ``broad'' view.
   The Reagan administration had asserted it wasn't bound by what
previous administrations told Congress about the meaning of the ABM
pact, a view the White House at one point tried to push in the
Senate debate over the INF treaty.
   Nunn threatened to block the treaty until Secretary of State
George P. Shultz promised last month that administration comments
on the treaty were ``authoritative,'' meaning that future
administrations couldn't try to change how the treaty is viewed.
   Since Shultz's promise was delivered, ``we can now proceed,
confident that the treaty the committee is being asked to approve
is the same treaty'' the administration believes it negotiated,
Nunn told Maynard Glitman, one of the chief negotiators for the
U.S. team which worked out the treaty, during a committee meeting
Monday.
   The committee has sent the State Department a list of 135
questions about possible ambiguities in the treaty, Nunn said. Most
are technical questions but some involve queries about possible
interpretation of the pact, which bans missiles with ranges from
300 miles to 3,400 miles.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, told Glitman, ``I'm sorry there was a
reinterpretation of the ABM treaty that made this necessary.''
   ``It's sad we have to go through the exercise we're going
through here,'' said Sen. James Exon, D-Neb.
   While the Armed Services panel was going through a detailed
scrutiny of the pact, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
continued taking testimony from public witnesses.
   Dr. Edward Teller, the physicist who is considered the father of
both the hydrogen bomb and Reagan's Star Wars program, told the
foreign relations panel he thought the fights over the meanings of
treaties were ``senseless debates.''
   Teller said he supports the treaty, although he is deeply
distrustful of the Soviet Union.
   Speaking of the treaty, he said, ``my personal approach is
careful, doubtful, yet positive,'' he said.

   Six European relief workers abducted by
rebels in Ethiopia's northern Tigre province were released Monday
and are in good condition, spokesmen for a Belgian medical
organization reported.
   They said the doctors and nurses were seized Thursday in Tigre
where separatists have been fighting the Marxist government for
years.
   Reginald Moreels, president of the Belgian branch of Medecins
Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), told a news conference
the victims were Belgian doctors Germaine Hanquet and Michel
Moreau, Dutch nurse Roland Raaijmaekers an Irish doctor and two
Irish nurses.
   Moreels said they were released in Adigrat, 12 miles north of
Idaga Hamous where the aid organization has been operating a
hospital for three years.
   News of their release was reported to Brussels by Dr. Pierre
Harze, who had been sent to Ethiopia to try to gain their freedom.
   Morrels said Harze had not yet met with the six.
   Jean-Pierre Luxen, director of the Belgian organization, said
the two Belgian doctors would go to northern city of Asmara and
return to Belgium later this week. He said other doctors would
replace them at the hospital in Idaga Hamous, 340 miles north of
the capital of Addis Ababa.
   Luxen said the medical team was abducted without violence by
members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of the Tigre who
also seized the group's vehicle and medical supplies.
   Seyoum Musse, an official with the Popular Front's office in
London, had announced earlier Monday that the six had been released.
   In a telephone interview in London, he said: ``The whole aim of
taking them with us was to show there are millions of people who
are beyond the reach of ... isolated symbolic (government) food
distribution centers like the one they were stationed at.
   ``The aim is to dispel the government's misinformation that
millions are being reached with aid,'' he added.
   He said the government will not allow foreign relief volunteers
``to go outside the place they work. For this reason we have taken
them a few hours away. They are the guests of millions of starved
people.''
   Medicins San Frontieres is an international non-governmental
organization that has medical aid projects in 15 countries in
Central America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia.

<HEAD>Peace Corps To Get Graduate School Volunteers Under New Programs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two more universities on Monday announced plans
to help boost the number and expertise of Peace Corps volunteers
with programs giving them graduate-level training or course credits
for their service.
   Starting with about 10 students in the 1988-89 school year, the
University of Alabama at Birmingham will offer candidates for
master's degrees in public health a chance to ``get their training
before they do their (Peace Corps) service,'' said Dr. Juan M.
Navia, chairman of the school's public health department.
   ``Some of our finest (public health graduate) students are the
ones who have served in other countries as Peace Corps volunteers.
And many of them have the frustration: `If only I had know this
then,''' Navia said at a news conference at the Carter Presidential
Center. ``We're going to reverse the order.''
   Peace Corps Director Loret Miller Ruppe also signed an agreement
Monday with the University of South Carolina in Columbia, which
will offer internship credit to special education graduate students
who do a tour of duty in the Peace Corps.
   Mrs. Ruppe said the two programs are similar to one announced
earlier for public health master's degree candidates at Boston
University, also starting next fall. And all three are modeled
after a program for master's degree students in public policy at
Rutgers University, which will send its first group of volunteers
to the Peace Corps this spring.
   ``These programs will help us ensure a steady flow of volunteers
with the skills we need in developing countries,'' Mrs. Ruppe said.
   She said the Corps hopes to double the number of volunteers by
1992 and to increase dramatically the number of minority
volunteers, who now number about 110 out of 5,200.
   The Peace Corps is starting a number of innovative programs to
help meet that goal.
   Harvard University School of Dentistry has agreed to send some
of its fifth-year dental students to the Peace Corps for six-month
stints, in an experiment with shorter tours of duty than the usual
two years, she said.
   Under another new program, teachers in Virginia can take
sabbaticals to spend a year in Peace Corps-sponsored teacher
training centers around the world, she said.
   In Northfield, Vt., some military cadets at Norwich University
are participating in a Peace Corps alternative to campus ROTC and
eventual military service. A bill pending in Congress would
authorize $5 million a year for five years to enable the Peace
Corps to test the ROTC-alternative program elsewhere.
   Both the Alabama and South Carolina programs will target
minorities.
   Also Monday, Helene Robertson of Birmingham, Ala., a 77-year-old
former Peace Corps volunteer to Botswana, received the Lillian
Carter Award for Enduring Voluntary Commitment.
   The award is named after former President Jimmy Carter's mother,
who was in her 60s when she served in the Peace Corps in India.
   Receiving ``Leader for Peace'' awards were Lillian Lewis, wife
of Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., an original Peace Corps volunteer in
1961 and associate director of the Institute for International
Affairs and Development at Atlanta University; Atlanta Mayor Andrew
Young for a recruiting public service announcement he did for the
Peace Corps; and The Coca-Cola Co. for its financing of a Peace
Corps program to re-establish contact with former volunteers.

   A funeral will be held Wednesday for Roger
J. Williams, a leading authority on nutrition who died at age 94.
   A professor emeritus at the University of Texas, Williams died
Saturday of pneumonia in an Austin nursing home. He had been in ill
health for several months, but still kept in touch with UT
scientists, many of whom he persuaded to come to Austin.
   Williams' work in nutrition at the UT Clayton Foundation
Biochemical Institute, which he founded, led to the discovery of
more vitamins and their variants than at any other research
facility in the world.
   He was particularly interested in the role nutrition played in
physical and mental well-being. Until he retired in 1985, Williams
worked regularly in his laboratory on the UT campus.
   Williams was a proponent of ``biochemical individuality,'' a
concept that no two people are exactly alike physiologically and
therefore everyone has different nutritional requirements.
   One of Williams' most significant accomplishments was the
discovery and isolation of pantothenic acid, one of the ``universal
vitamins'' required by all living cells and essential to life.
Later he discovered and named folic acid, a substance used by every
cell in the body.
   Survivors include his wife, Phyllis, three sons, a daughter,
nine grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.

died at age 84.
   Fuller died Sunday at Blodgett Memorial Medical Center, hours
after complaining of faintess during a prayer meeting at Wealthy
Park Baptist Church, where he was pastor until his 1974 retirement.
   Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., Fuller founded the Children's Bible

660 radio stations worldwide.
   ``He was one of the leading fundamentalist preachers in the
country,'' said the Rev. Robert Gage, minister of Wealthy Park
Baptist Church. ``It is going to leave a big void for us.''
   Funeral services are scheduled for Wednesday at Wealthy Park.
   Fuller is survived by his wife, Virginia; a daughter, Mrs.

<TEXT>
   Cyprus' Greek and Turkish leaders sparred
Monday only a day after elections, with the Turkish head proposing
talks in neutral territory and the Greek president-elect insisting
they be held on his own turf.
   The dispute over a matter of protocol disappointed some who had
for a new start in talks to reunify Cyprus in a federation.
   The sparring began when Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
invited Greek Cypriot president-elect George Vassiliou to informal
talks on the future of the island, to be held in a neutral area.
Vassiliou countered with an invitation to Denktash ``to come and
see me at the presidential palace.''
   ``I am the elected president of the Cyprus Republic and in that
capacity I would be most happy to welcome Mr. Denktash as the
leader of the Turkish Cypriot community,'' Vassiliou said in a
radio interview.
   Denktash is president of the breakaway Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus, which was proclaimed in 1983 and is
internationally recognized only by Turkey. He does not recognize
Vassiliou, who will be sworn in next Sunday, as president of all
Cyprus.
   Vassiliou, a millionaire businessman backed by the Communist
Party, defeated veteran right-wing politician Glafcos Clerides in
general elections Sunday. Only Greek Cypriots voted.
   An official announcement said President Reagan sent Vassiliou a
message of congratulations, expressing the wish to continue
relations with Cyprus.
   ``I look forward, through you, to continuing the friendly
relations between our two countries, a relationship which has been
characterized by a special warmth and a constant effort to build
mutual respect and understanding,'' Reagan's message said.
   ``I know that you have the determination to make the effort to
bring about the lasting peace which has so long escaped the people
of Cyprus,'' the message said.
   Vassiliou said he will thank Reagan in a message expressing hope
the United States will more actively to persuade Turkey to withdraw
its troops.
   Denktash proposed in his invitation to Vassiliou that the talks
be held at the Ledra Palace Hotel, a U.N. headquarters on the Green
Line dividing Turkish and Greek Cypriots. He said the meeting
``would be between the leaders of the two politically equal parties
or between the presidents of two equal political entities.''
   Vassiliou had said during his campaign that he was willing to
meet with the Turkish Cypriots without preconditions.
   But his counter-offer to meet Denktash at the presidential
palace in the Greek Cypriot-controlled zone, citing his own role as
president of Cyprus and Denktash only as leader of the Turkish
Cypriot community, was certain to be rebuffed.
   In the interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., Vassiliou
indicated no new flexibility in the conflict between Greek and
Turkish Cypriots.
   He accused Turkey of building up its military presence in the
Turkish Cypriot zone in northern Cyprus since the 1974 invasion
which partitioned the island. The invasion followed a coup by Greek
Cypriot extremists aimed at uniting the entire island with Greece.
   ``The realities of Cyprus are that in these years, Turkey,
instead of recucing its military presence here, has been building
it up in every way,'' he said.
   He also accused Turkey of bringing in 40,000 to 50,000 Turkish
settlers to beef up the Turkish Cypriot minority, which numbered
120,000 at the time of the invasion. The Greek Cypriot population
is more than 500,000.
   After election results were announced early Monday, Vassiliou
said he would work for the withdrawal of Turkish troops and
settlers, but woud try to achieve a spirit of rapprochement with
the Turkish Cypriots.
   Greek-Turkish negotiations have been stalled since President
Spyros Kyprianou, who lost a bid for a third term in the first
round of elections Feb. 14, rejected proposals for a two-zone
federation proposed by the United Nations in 1986.
   The proposals had been accepted by Denktash, who now insists
upon them as the basis for restarting talks.
   Kyprianou had insisted that before any talks began on a
federation, all Turkish troops must withdraw and the Turks must
allow Greek Cypriot refugees, who fled after the 1974 invasion, to
return to their homes in the north.
   The U.N. proposals suggested that talks on troop withdrawal and
the ``right of return'' would be discussed by committees
simultaneously with talks on the nature of the federation.

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz tasted the
fruits of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms first-hand Monday as he
hosted a candlelit dinner at a cooperative restaurant that was once
a money-losing bar.
   The red-brick Skazka (``Fairy Tale'') restaurant off
southeastern Moscow's Taganka Square would have been illegal before
last year's decision by Soviet authorities to loosen laws governing
individual labor and cooperative ownership.
   ``As soon as we heard they were authorizing cooperatives, we
decided to start one,'' said Sergei V. Kutuzov, the head of the
nine-member collective that runs the Skazka.
   The restaurant, which can seat 34 customers in its upstairs
dining room, opened April 1 last year. Its hearty Russian fare
swiftly made it so popular with Muscovites and foreign residents
that profits soared to as much as $23,300 a month, Kutuzov said.
   Skazka's friendly waitresses and prompt service are in stark
contrast to the situation that prevails at most of Moscow's
state-owned restaurants, where customers sometimes wait for hours
before being served.
   Cooperatives are also more expensive than state-run restaurants,
which has led some Soviets to oppose them as socially unjust.
   The dinner menu offered Shultz cost between $25 and $33 per
person, Kutuzov said, compared to an average of $3 to $8 for an
evening meal in a government-owned restaurant.
   A table piled with sturgeon in aspic, pickled vegetables inside
a pumpkin, bottles of mineral water and grapes was set out for
Shultz, who had finished two days of talks in Moscow with top
Soviet officials, including Gorbachev, the Communist Party leader.
   Skazka's chefs also prepared homemade noodle soup with
mushrooms, a cabbage soup called ``shchi,'' stuffed pork cutlets,
dumplings with mushroom and chicken and small Russian pancakes.
   Shultz, who was accompanied by his wife Helena and U.S.
Ambassador Jack Matlock, met in the dining room with some of the
Soviet Union's top cultural figures and intellectuals, including
cinematographer Elem Klimov, playwright Mikhail Shatrov, economist
Nikolai Shmelov and writer Vladimir Soloukhin.
   Reporters briefly allowed into the wood-paneled room before
Shultz arrived spotted one apparent concession to the VIP guests _
bottles of Georgian and French wines set out on a table.
   As a cooperative, the Skazka normally does not have the right to
serve alcohol.
   Gorbachev said in mid-January that 13,000 co-ops had been
established in the Soviet Union. He said more than 300,000 people
were working for themselves within guidelines set by the government
to encourage better services and goods than those provided by the
state-run sector.
   The venture has been a clear success for the nine people who put
up a total of $5,000 to launch the Skazka. Last month Kutuzov,
chairman of the Skazka cooperative, took home $1,050, more than
three times the average Soviet wage of $330.
   The building that now contains the restaurant was once a bar
favored by ``Lyubers,'' body-building enthusiasts from a Moscow
suburb that some press reports have said prey on long-haired Soviet
youths who like Western rock music.
   Either because of its tough clientele, or because the
health-conscious Lyubers did not drink enough alcohol, the bar lost
money, Kutuzov said.
   Now its clientele has radically changed, with foreigners making
up as much as 90 percent of the dinner customers on a given
evening, Kutuzov said.

   The guided-missile frigate USS Antrim has been
selected to steam through the nation's mid-section this year for
the Navy's annual Great Lakes cruise, the service said Monday.
   The cruise, part of the Navy's campaign to recruit sailors, will
send the Antrim to 21 ports over three months.
   ``This annual Navy event ... offers a unique opportunity for
residents of the Great Lakes region to see first-hand a ship from
today's modern Navy,'' the service said.
   The Antrim will begin its cruise with a June 16 stopover at Port
Jefferson, N.Y., the Navy said. Among the larger cities to be
visited are Montreal; Windsor, Ontario; Milwaukee; Chicago; Duluth,
Minn.; Erie, Pa.; Oswego, N.Y., and Toronto.
   The Antrim will end the 1988 cruise in September with stops in
Baltimore and Savannah, Ga., on the way to its homeport in Mayport,
Fla.

   Vice President George Bush stumped in
South Carolina Monday, saying Sen. Strom Thurmond's endorsement of
rival Bob Dole raises the stakes in the state's March 5 Republican
presidential primary.
   ``I have great respect for Sen. Thurmond,'' said Bush. ``It's
going to make this an even more dramatic ground of confrontation.''
   The South Carolina GOP primary comes just three days before the
Super Tuesday round of contests in 20 other, mostly Southern
states. The four Republican candidates have said their showing in
South Carolina will be crucial leading into Super Tuesday.
   During a three-hour visit to Myrtle Beach, Bush spoke briefly at
a civic club luncheon, addressed about 1,200 students and visitors
at Myrtle Beach High School and then held a series of meetings with
reporters.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell, the chairman of Bush's Southern campaign
accompanied the vice president and said the Dole campaign has
``created a do-or-die situation'' by pushing for the South Carolina
senator's endorsement.
   ``Everybody loves Strom Thurmond, I love Strom Thurmond. I think
they've raised the stakes. They've said, `Now we've got him; now
we're going to win,''' Campbell said.
   Bush called South Carolina ``a key state'' and campaign aides
said he will likely spend at least four more days campaigning in
the state prior to March 5.
   Bush, with reporters in tow, stopped briefly at a luncheon
meeting of the Myrtle Beach Rotary Club at a local seafood
restaurant.
   ``I think I'm going to win in South Carolina,'' Bush said. ``If
I win in South Carolina, I will be the next president of the United
States.''
   Bush flew to the state from Texas, before heading on for
additional stops in Tennessee and Missouri.
   The visit came on the eve of caucuses in Minnesota and a primary
in South Dakota, but Bush said, ``You've got limited resources and
we've allocated to Super Tuesday and South Carolina.''

<TEXT>
   Sen. Jesse Helms has asked the CIA to
investigate allegations by a Panamanian dissident that the agency
passed personal information to Panama's strong man, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, about Helms and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, it was
disclosed Monday.
   The request was made in a letter Helms sent last week to CIA
Director William Webster following congressional testimony two
weeks ago by Jose I. Blandon, a former Noriega associate who is now
a leading critic of Panama's defense chief.
   In the letter, a copy of which was made available to The
Associated Press, the North Carolina Republican said it is
``improper and illegal'' for the CIA to maintain files on members
of Congress.
   At the time of Blandon's testimony, the CIA said it
``categorically denies'' his allegations.
   A CIA spokeswoman, Sharon Foster, had no comment Monday on
Helms' letter except to say that communications from members of
Congress are confidential but are taken seriously and are answered.
   In a separate letter to FBI Director William Sessions, Helms
asked whether the agency had ever passed on information about
members of Congress or their staffs to the CIA and whether it ever
it had engaged in wiretaps or surveillance on him or members of his
staff.
   Blandon, testifying before a Senate subcommittee on Feb. 9, said
the CIA passed to Noriega data about Helms, Kennedy, D-Mass., and
two of their aides. The two senators have been among Noriega's
strongest critics on Capitol Hill, citing allegations of Noriega's
involvement in drug trafficking.
   Helms said Blandon's credibility ``appeared to be high.'' He
added that he received information from other countries indicating
the CIA had delivered similar information to them on other senators.
   He asked Webster whether the CIA had ever maintained information
on members of Congress or their staffs and whether such information
was ever passed on to any official of a foreign government,
specifically the Panamanian Defense Forces.
   Helms indicated he was skeptical about the CIA's denial,
contending that it made an inquiry afterward to CIA field offices
and to the heads of U.S. agencies involved in national security
issues as to whether the denial was accurate.
   Ms. Foster of the CIA said she was unable to comment on that
allegation.
   Blandon, meanwhile, met under heavy guard Monday at the U.S.
Courthouse with prosecutors investigating the Iran-Contra arms and
money affair. He presumably was questioned by the staff of
independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh about Noriega's agreement to
train Nicaraguan rebels at the request of Lt. Col. Oliver North, a
former National Security Council official who is a target of
Walsh's investigation.
   Blandon was a key informant for federal prosecutors in Florida
who earlier this month obtained indictments charging Noriega with
taking at least $4.6 million in bribes to protect a major Colombian
drug ring.

<TEXT>
   A principal witness in the drug conspiracy
case against Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega faces up to 20
years in prison when sentenced this week for his part in the ring
which smuggled 500,000 pounds of marijuana and 1{ tons of cocaine
into the United States.
   But Steven Michael Kalish, 35, expects leniency for his
testimony against Noriega, which included Kalish's report that he
made made $900,000 in payoffs to the Panamanian strongman.
   ``Obviously, he's hoping he won't have to spend too much time in
jail,'' said Dick DeGuerin, Kalish's friend and defense attorney in
Houston.
   Kalish pleaded guilty a year ago during the trial of his
partner, Leigh Bruce Ritch, and has since emerged as a principal
witness against Noriega in the Tampa conspiracy case. Noriega also
faces separate racketeering and drug charges in Miami.
   Ritch, 34, is serving a sentence of 30 years in prison.
   In the Tampa case, Kalish testified he gave Noriega cash and
jewelry in exchange for Panamanian banking services and military
protection.
   Kalish told a U.S. Senate panel last month that he became
attracted to Panama in 1983 because of its international banking
facilities. He flew there with $2.4 million in cash and met with
Cesar Rodriguez Contreras at the Bank of Boston Building in Panama
City, Kalish said.
   Rodriguez, who was slain in Colombia in 1986, ``offered me an
entire package of corporate banking and investment services and
even armored car delivery from the airport,'' Kalish testified.
   Rodriguez introduced Kalish to Noriega at the general's home,
Kalish told the committee. At their first meeting, Kalish delivered
a suitcase with $300,000 cash, he said, and discussed his
investment plans in Panama. For the next 10 months, Kalish told the
panel, he used Panama as his base, living in a three-story
Spanish-style house around the corner from Noriega's.
   In November 1983, Kalish bought the Panamanian Defense Forces a
Boeing 727 jet to deliver shipments of drug profits from the United
States to Panama. In exchange for a Bell 212 helicopter Kalish
bought for the defense forces, according to the charges, Noriega
arranged for an irrevocable $2 million line of credit for Kalish
from a Panamanian bank.
   Noriega also provided Kalish with a diplomatic passport and
agreed to let Ritch and Kalish use Panamanian banks to launder more
than $100 million in anticipated profits from a million-pound
marijuana smuggling venture that Kalish was organizing in Colombia
in early 1984, according to the federal charges.
   Kalish began his career in drug trafficking at an early age, his
friends say.
   The son of a mid-level Gulf Oil Corp. executive who died in
1980, Kalish was born in Texas and grew up in Bellaire, a
comfortable suburb of Houston. DeGuerin said Kalish was already
selling marijuana when he dropped out of the 11th grade.
   ``I don't believe he ever had a straight job,'' said DeGuerin.
   By age 27, Kalish had been indicted twice in Houston for trying
to import 140,000 pounds of marijuana in two loads nine days apart
in December 1979. The second seizure _ 100,000 pounds _ was then
the largest ever in Texas. Kalish eventually fled, assumed a new
identity and in 1983 settled in Tampa, where he worked with Ritch,
says Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Kennedy in Tampa.
   Kalish and Ritch set up a smuggling organization and a
sophisticated nationwide distribution network that made more than
$200 million in four years.
   The Kalish-Ritch organization began to fall apart when the FBI
arrested Kalish on July 26, 1984, as he was boarding a chartered
Lear jet under an assumed name at Tampa International Airport.

<HEAD>Nofziger Attorneys Try To Overturn Guilty Verdict, Get New Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lyn Nofziger's defense attorneys filed motions
Monday to set aside the former presidential aide's illegal lobbying
convictions on the grounds that prosecutors failed to prove he
violated the law.
   The defense also filed a motion for a new trial, contending that
U.S. District Judge Thomas A. Flannery erroneously instructed
jurors about determining whether the issues Nofziger lobbied about
were of ``direct and substantial'' interest to the White House.
   Nofziger, 63, was convicted Feb. 11 of three counts of illegally
lobbying former White House colleagues on behalf of Wedtech Corp.,
a maritime engineers union and the manufacturer of the Air Force
A-10 anti-tank plane.
   The former White House political director faces a potential
two-year prison term and a $10,000 fine for each of the three
convictions. He is scheduled to be sentenced March 25.
   In its motions in U.S. District Court, the defense repeated
contentions made throughout the four-week trial that the
prosecution team headed by independent counsel James C. McKay
failed to prove that the issues Nofziger raised with former
colleagues were ``particular matters'' of ``direct and substantial
interest'' to the White House.
   ``The gross insufficiency of the evidence mandates that the
guilty verdict ... against Mr. Nofziger b set aside and that a
judgment of acquittal be entered,'' defense lawyer Robert Plotkin
and E. Lawrence Barcella said in their pleadings.
   In asking for a new trial, the defense said the definition of
``direct and substantial interest'' that Flannery gave the jury
during final instructions ``clearly encompassed interest well
beyond the scope of the statute.''
   This instruction allowed jurors to confuse the ``personal
interest of certain representatives of the White House'' with
``direct and substantial'' interest, the defense said.
   For instance, references in testimony to Pier F. Talenti, a
volunteer on Nofziger's White House staff who visited Wedtech
Corp.'s plant, might be the only basis for the jury to conclude the
White House had an interest in Wedtech's bid for a military engine
contract, the defense said.
   Although he was not called as a witness, Talenti was described
by a former Wedtech executive as expressing interest in the
company's bid for a contract to build small engines for the Army in
1981.
   An Army procurement official also testified that Talenti urged
consideration of Wedtech's bid that year.
   The defense said Flannery's ``internally inconsistent and
confusing'' instruction ``failed adequately to explain the
comparative and relative importance of a matter to the White House,
and it did not instruct the jury to place that interest in its
proper context.''
   Nofziger, who left the White House in early 1982, was convicted,
among other things, for sending an April 8, 1982, memo to
then-presidential counselor Edwin Meese III urging support for
Wedtech's efforts to persuade reluctant Army officials to award the
$32 million contract.
   ``The very purpose of the communication to Mr. Meese was to
create and stimulate interest, a contact that is not prohibited''
by the law, the defense said.
   Meese, now attorney general, testified at the trial that he
couldn't recall receiving Nofziger's note, which suggested he
enlist the support of Reagan and other top administration officials.

   Former TV evangelist Pat Robertson took out
$5.5 million in loans last month as the presidential contenders
headed to the cash-draining Super Tuesday primaries, and George
Bush remained by far the richest candidate with more than $9
million in the bank.
   Among Democratic hopefuls, money leader Michael Dukakis had a $4
million bankroll, his financial statement shows.
   Robertson reported $5.5 million in loans and contributions of
$1.3 million during January, in addition to the $6.5 million he got
in federal matching funds. Robertson had earlier said he might not
use the matching funds because he was philosophically opposed to
the public financing system.
   He ended the month with $5.5 million in cash on hand, second
only to Bush's warchest, but Robertson had an outstanding debt of
$6 million.
   Robertson's campaign did not immediately return calls Monday
evening to answer questions about where he got the loan or what it
was for.
   In an interesting twist, Bush, while raising the most money, has
actually spent less against the overall primary season spending
limit than any of the other Republican contenders, including the
struggling campaign of Rep. Jack Kemp of New York.
   The Bush forces have been carefully husbanding their resources
to ensure they don't reach the $27 million limit too early in the
nominating campaign, thereby shorting themselves for the contests
that come after the Super Tuesday races on March 8.
   The latest campaign figures are contained in reports filed over
the weekend with the Federal Election Commission. The reports cover
totals for the month of January.
   As of Jan. 31, the vice president had spent $10.7 million
against the $27 million cap, compared to Kemp's $12.8 million. Sen.
Bob Dole, R-Kan., had spent $13.5 million and ended January with
$4.2 million in the bank.
   Robertson reported spending a whopping $17.5 million against the
cap, and his report showed heavy expenditures across the Super
Tuesday states, topped by more than $1 million spent in Texas. By
contrast, Bush spent $335,743 in Texas, Dole spent $81,645 there,
and Kemp spent $11,312.
   On the Democratic side, none of the candidates were approaching
that level, with Dukakis spending the most against the ceiling, at
$7.8 million.
   Kemp continued to squeak by financially, taking out $750,000
worth of loans in January and ending the month with a debt of $1.3
million. Kemp hoped to pay that off with the help of nearly
$600,000 in government matching funds he expects to receive by the
end of this month, said campaign political director Charlie Black.
   Kemp aides are relying on a heavy mail solicitation which has
brought in a steady flow of money in recent weeks, including most
of the $1 million Kemp raised in January, he said. Kemp is netting
about $400,000 a week in fund-raising, Black said.
   Black insisted the campaign is not in serious financial trouble,
though he conceded, ``Sure, I'd like to have another couple million
to spend on Super Tuesday.'' He said he has budgeted about $1.5
million for the campaign through Super Tuesday, and is spending
between $250,000 and $300,000 on television for South Carolina's
March 5 primary.
   Black said that Kemp's spending against the overall limit is not
a problem because he will buy TV time in only seven Super Tuesday
states.
   Among the Democrats, Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois and Rep.
Richard Gephardt of Missouri both ended January in debt, and had to
take out loans to keep their campaigns afloat in February's Iowa
caucuses and New Hampshire primary.
   Simon took out a $523,674 loan in January, and ended the month
with a $691,069 debt and only $401,176 in the bank.
   Gephardt did not report any January loans but, according to
aides, did borrow money this month. He entered February with
$820,260 in debts and $172,477 in cash on hand.
   Democrats Michael Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, and Sen.
Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, on the other hand, were in good shape
_ Dukakis with $4 million in the bank and $511,789 in bills to pay
off, and Gore with $2 million on hand and $84,248 in obligations.
   Gore ignored the Iowa race to concentrate on the Super Tuesday
states, but he raised very little money during the time the other
candidates were campaigning hard in Iowa and New Hampshire. He
collected only $180,746 in contributions during January, in
addition to the $1.8 million in matching funds he got, his report
showed.
   Dukakis raised $804,839 in contributions and got $3.5 million
matching funds.
   Most candidates got very large matching fund payments in
January, the first month the government funds were released, and
the sums were based on the candidates' fund-raising for all
preceding months. Candidates can receive matching funds from the
federal Treasury for every contribution of $250 or less. The fund
is supported by the $1 checkoff on individual tax returns.
   Democratic contender Jesse Jackson reported raising $610,036 in
donations, plus $598,021 in matching funds during January, ending
the month with $509,978 in cash on hand and $354,881 in obligations.
   Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart ended the month with $615,547 in
cash on hand after collecting $70,303 in contributions and $937,325
in matching funds.
   Simon's finance director, Bob Edgar, announced that the senator
has raised more than $1 million in donations so far this year, and
in the two weeks following the Feb. 8 Iowa contest set a record for
his campaign.
   His report shows that in January he raised $534,259 in
contributions, $1.9 million in matching funds, and $523,674 in
loans.
   Gephardt collected $212,702 in contributions and $1.9 million in
matching funds. Gephardt's campaign manager, Bill Carrick, has said
that the congressman will not buy TV advertising in all 20 Super
Tuesday states, but will concentrate on Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana,
Oklahoma and Florida.
   As of the Jan. 31 report, however, Gephardt had spent very
little in those states _ for example, a total of $69,809 in Texas,
compared to Dukakis' $301,829, and $23,454 in Florida, compared to
Dukakis' $206,861 there.
   In Arkansas, Louisiana and Oklahoma, Gephardt had spent less
than $5,000 each as of the beginning of this month.
   Dukakis has also far outspent Gore in the South, a region in
which the Tennessee senator has pinned his presidential hopes.

   All firefighters scheduled to work
Monday night's shift joined scores of other colleagues in calling
in sick, leaving Providence's fire protection to 87 firefighters
who have been on duty around the clock since Friday.
   Meanwhile, a Superior Court judge delayed ruling on the city's
request for contempt citations against 110 firefighters who called
in sick over the weekend in defiance of a back-to-work order.
   Judge Americo Campanella gave union president Leo J. Miller
until 10 a.m. Tuesday to inform all 450 members of the union that
they must to return to work under the temporary restraining order
issued Saturday by another judge.
   Miller was also ordered to furnish a list of all firefighters
who had called in sick over the weekend and outline the nature of
their illness or the illness of family members they said they were
staying home to care for.
   City officials went from home to home Monday leaving notices for
firefighters of the contempt hearing. Campanella indicated his
decision to put off ruling on the matter hinged on the relatively
low number of firefighters contacted either by the city or Miller.
   The union represents 450 of the city's total uniformed force of
479. Campanella indicated his decision to put off ruling on the
matter hinged on the relatively low number of firefighters
contacted either by the city or Miller.
   Miller, a fire captain, denies the union orchestrated any
sickout.
   If found to be a job action as Moise and city officials assert,
the sickout would be illegal under Rhode Island law.
   The dispute apparently concerns language in a contract ratified
by firefighters in December that the city has yet to sign.
   Miller said the city is trying to renege on a provision that
calls for an officer to be placed in charge of each rescue unit.
Union members also complain that promises to replacement worn-out
or damaged equipment like boots, helmets and firecoats have not
been fulfilled.
   All but one of the 51 firefighters scheduled to report for work
at 8 a.m. Saturday called in sick Friday, said Fire Chief Michael
F. Moise.
   An additional 60 called in sick for the shift that was supposed
to begin at 6 a.m. Sunday, Moise said.
   Assistant Fire Chief Gilbert H. McLaughlin Jr. told Campanella
that all of the firefighters scheduled to report at 6 p.m. Monday
had called in sick.
   ``I have nobody coming in,'' McLaughlin testified.
   The union represents 450 of the city's total uniformed force of
479. The firefighters, divided into four platoons, work two 10-hour
days and two 12-hour days, then are off four days.
   Moise said the 87 firefighters in the platoon that has been kept
on duty since Friday evening will stay on the job until the issue
is resolved.
   The chief testified the average absentee level is seven to eight
firefighters for any particular shift.
   Miller agreed the number of sick firefighters was ``unusually
high.''
   Most of the people he contacted after the restraining order was
issued said either they or someone in their family had a 24-hour
virus, Miller said.
   Miller said he called in sick because his mother, who has heart
trouble, also had the flu.
   Ragosta tried to show the sickout presented a danger to the
public health and safety. Moise said he was becoming concerned that
fatigue among firefighters on the job since Friday might affect
their ability to operate sophisticated equipment and their response
time in a crisis.
   He said the sickout was costing $20,000 a day in overtime and
related expenses.

<HEAD>Strong Winds Whip Up Much Of Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   High winds blew across much of the nation Monday, felling trees
and power lines and prompting weather forecasters to post gale
warnings in coastal and lake areas.
   An intense low pressure system over Ontario produced the gusty
south to southwesterly wind from the southern Plains across the
Tennessee and Ohio valleys and into the lower Great Lakes region
and Vermont.
   Blasts of up to 120 mph were recorded at Mines Peak, Colo., in
the early-morning hours. Power outages due to wind knocking down
utility poles were reported at Fort Smith, Ark., where several
carport awnings were blown loose in gusts up to 52 mph.
   A gust of 61 mph whipped Erie, Pa., shortly after noon, while
wind of 50 mph and up was clocked at Burlington, Vt.; Buffalo,
N.Y.; Cleveland; St. Louis; Indianapolis; Cheyenne, Wyo.; and Rapid
City, S.D.
   High-wind warnings and wind advisories were posted for parts of
western Minnesota, western Texas, lakes Erie and Huron and the
northern New England coast.
   Meanwhile, strong northerly winds of 25-40 mph brought colder
weather to the northern and central Plains.
   Temperatures dropped from the mid-40s to the mid-20s in one hour
at Nunn and Briggsdale, Colo., early Monday morning as a cold front
plowed through the area.
   Arctic air accompanied the strong winds across Minnesota and
North Dakota. The temperature at Warroad, Minn., dropped from 30
degrees to 8 degrees in two hours as the cold air pushed through.
   Snow was scattered across parts of Montana, Wyoming,
northeastern Colorado and northern Maine. Two to 5 inches of snow
was reported in the Casper, Wyo., area.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 11 at
International Falls, Minn., to 81 at McAllen, Texas. The
early-morning low for the nation was 14 below zero at Gunnison,
Colo.
   For Tuesday, snow was forecast from northern New England across
parts of New York state; scattered snow showers or flurries in
northern sections of the Ohio Valley and the upper Great Lakes;
widely scattered snow showers in the mountains of Montana and
Colorado; rain from central and southern New England across the
middle Atlantic Coast states into the Tennessee Valley; and rain
showers from the central Gulf Coast through northern Florida,

   Ron Sexton's reward for winning a school
contest was nothing to snort at. Then again, it probably didn't
make him squeal with delight.
   Sexton, a history teacher and wrestling coach at Wilmington High
School, came in first in a school project to raise money for
Children's Hospital in Columbus. His payoff _ he had to kiss a pig.
   He put his mouth where the smart money was, planting a kiss on
the snout of a pig during a pep rally Friday while the students and
faculty watched.
   Sexton won a contest in which students and teachers put money in
gallon milk jugs as their way of choosing a sow smoocher. There
were 45 teachers up for votes, which cost 25 cents to cast, said
home economics teacher Bonnie Hansen.
   The contest, dubbed ``Squeal of Fortune,'' raised nearly $250.

   Auburn residents better not plan to serve
pie this weekend _ not with a horde of Curly, Larry and Moe fans
headed their way.
   Three Stooges aficionados from throughout the nation are
expected to converge on this central Maine city to share
recollections of the zany antics that entertained generations of
moviegoers and television viewers.
   The two-day convention, which begins Saturday, will feature
about 30 dealers in Stooges memorabilia, imitators of the threesome
and, of course, a pie fight.
   ``They kind of created the pie fight,'' said Ron Eugley, the
convention organizer. ``In about a quarter of their shorts, there's
somebody getting a pie in the face.''
   Eugley, a 36-year-old salesman from Auburn, said the convention
has been promoted in the national magazine published by the Three
Stooges fan club and is expected to draw more than 700 fans.
   The convention will be addressed by telephone by Emil Sitka, a
supporting actor for the Stooges who is writing a book about the
late comics.
   Stooges movies will be shown throughout the convention, Eugley
said, including some never seen by the general public.
   ``Curly was married four times _ he had quite the thing for
women _ and we'll have some films of his weddings,'' Eugley said.
He said convention-goers will also see films of Moe Howard
entertaining at a backyard barbecue.
   Proceeds from the convention will go to the American Cancer
Society, in part because Howard died of the disease.

<HEAD>Report Near Collision Between Helicopter And Jet Fighter: Third in
Two Weeks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An oil rig helicopter and a Phantom jet fighter
came within a half-mile of colliding over the North Sea on Monday,
according to the helicopter firm. It was the third reported
near-miss in two weeks in Britain's crowded skies.
   The earlier incidents involved jetliners carrying hundreds of
passengers and prompted calls for an inquiry into growing air
congestion before the summer travel season begins. The government
on Monday accused air traffic controllers of fomenting ``public
hysteria'' and said there was no cause for alarm.
   Bristow Helicopters said its Puma craft carrying 11 passengers
and two crew members from an oil rig 165 miles northeast of
Aberdeen climbed sharply as it neared the Scottish city after air
traffic controllers warned that it was on a collision course with a
Royal Air Force jet.
   Bristow said its helicopter moved up from an altitude of 2,000
feet and the Phantom passed below. Both aircraft landed safely and
no one was reported injured.
   A Bristow spokesman said the helicopter pilot filed an ``air
miss'' report with the Civil Aviation Authority, or CAA.
   Earlier Monday, Transport Secretary Paul Channon promised an
investigation into an incident Sunday involving a British
Caledonian BA 1-11 and a Pan American Boeing 727.
   Channon told the House of Commons the jetliners came within
2,000 yards while flying over southern England but he said they
were not in danger of colliding.
   He said the number of near-misses had declined sharply in the
last 10 years. ``We musn't be complacent, neither must we
overreact,'' he said.
   In the previous incident this month, a British Airways Lockheed
L1011 and a Balkan Bulgarian Tu 54 with a total of 543 people
aboard narrowly avoided colliding. The CAA called that an
``exceptionally serious'' case and Channon said the authority took
the unusual step of asking the Department of Transport to make an
independent investigation.
   According to the CAA, the number of near-misses per 100,000
flying hours in British air space decreased from 6.2 in 1980 to 2.8
in 1986.
   It said there were 12 incidents involving serious risk last
year, unchanged from 1986.
   Chris Stock, president of Britain's largest air traffic
controllers' union, said the control system is nearly overloaded.
   ``The system is working at full blast,'' said Stock, head of the
1,500-member Guild of Air Traffic Controllers. ``If a mistake is
made then there is very little room to maneuver.''
   He said safety should improve when a new computer system is
inaugurated in 1990 and a new control center in 1995. The guild has
demanded increased manpower in the meantime, saying five job
vacancies at the main control center in West Drayton have not been
filled since September.
   The CAA on Monday claimed the controllers were promoting public
alarm to gain leverage in negotiations over working conditions,
including the number of controllers on duty at peak times.
   ``The controllers are putting pressure on the CAA by harping on
the subject of safety,'' said the authority spokesman who was not
identified in line with government policy. ``Anonymous controllers
are constantly feeding information engendering alarm and concern.''

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis said Monday he might
authorize military operations against terrorist base camps if he
wins the White House. GOP hopeful Bob Dole taunted Vice President
Bush for ceasing efforts in South Dakota and Minnesota,
battlegrounds for this week's campaign contests.
   ``I don't know where George Bush is,'' Dole said in Duluth.
``Later today we're going to send him a map of Minnesota so at
least he gets a little idea where it is.''
   Bush was in South Carolina and Tennessee, virtually conceding
the South Dakota primary and Minnesota caucuses to his GOP rivals.
But he predicted he wouldn't be hurt by that.
   ``I think I'm going to be the next president of the United
States,'' the vice president said in Myrtle Beach, S.C.
   Dole is heavily favored to win the South Dakota contest. But he
sounded less confident of his chances for victory in Minnesota,
where former television evangelist Pat Robertson and Rep. Jack Kemp
have waged energetic campaigns.
   On the Democratic side, Dukakis has invested heavily in
Minnesota in hopes of bagging a win outside his New England
backyard. He, Rep. Richard Gephardt, Sen. Paul Simon, Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. and Jesse Jackson have campaigned heavily in South Dakota
as well.
   Gephardt campaigned in South Dakota and Wyoming, while his
spokesman accused Gore of hypocrisy and released a list of what he
said were switches in position the Tennessee senator has made on
issues ranging from abortion to farm policy to spending for the MX
missiles.
   That was an attempt to turn the tables on Gore, who has
vigorously attacked Gephardt for switching his position on key
issues.
   Dukakis made a brief visit to Washington, where he took part in
a National Governors' Association meeting with President Reagan.
   He emerged from the session to blast the president's
anti-terrorism policy and say the United States would be living
with the consequences of secret arms sales to Iran for a long time.
   ``You never, ever make concessions to terrorism,'' Dukakis said.
``If you ever do it, then your policy is worthless.''
   He added: ``This is international crime, pure and simple and you
fight it the way you fight crime _ with tough police work, with
effective undercover operations, with military operations against
terrorist base camps if necessary.''
   Dukakis did not elaborate on what conditions might prompt him to
authorize military operations.
   But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said such talk could
conceivably make life more difficult for a hostage. ``I would
simply urge caution on everyone's part, including political
candidates,'' he said.
   Simon was in Minnesota during the day, invoking the name of the
state's late Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey as he bid to score well in the
caucuses.
   The Illinois senator was cheered enthusiastically by a crowd at
Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minn., where he said he
would propose a mutual nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet
Union if elected.
   Simon once said he needed to win in either Minnesota or South
Dakota this week to keep his campaign alive, but has since pulled
back from that standard. ``I am going to do respectably,'' he said,
adding he believes the Democratic race will stay muddled beyond the
March 8 round of contests _ mostly in Southern and border states _
known as Super Tuesday.
   In Washington, financial reports filed with the Federal Election
Commission showed Bush's campaign with the biggest bankroll _ $9
million _ going into the Super Tuesday primaries. Among Democratic
hopefuls, Dukakis led with $4 million on hand.
   Robertson reported $5.5 million in loans and contributions of
$1.3 million during January, in addition to the $6.5 million he got
in federal matching funds. Robertson had earlier said he might not
use the matching funds because he was philosophically opposed to
the public financing system.
   He ended the month with $5.5 million in cash on hand, second
only to Bush's warchest, but Robertson had an outstanding debt of
$6 million. Robertson's campaign did not immediately return calls
Monday evening to answer questions about where he got the loan or
what it was for.
   With most of the campaign still to go, Bush had spent $10.7
million against the $27 million campaign limit, compared with
Kemp's $12.8 million and Dole's $13.5 million. Robertson reported
spending a whopping $17.5 million against the cap, and his report
showed heavy expenditures across the Super Tuesday states.
   On the Democratic side, Dukakis had spent the most against the
ceiling, at $7.8 million.
   Also on Monday, Democrat Gore won the endorsement of Alabama
Sen. Howell Heflin as he continued lining up support of as many
Southern politicians as possible in advance of Super Tuesday.
   But in an unusual news conference, Heflin said he wanted to
``educate'' Gore on some of the issues. ``He's not too far to the
left, but I've got to try to bring him to the middle a little
bit,'' Heflin said. ``I'm going to work on him.''
   In the Republican race, Kemp appeared before an economics class
at the University of Minnesota and called Bush's advocacy of a
four-year budget freeze ``embarrassing.''
   Said Kemp, ``Can you think of anything more yawning in a
peresidential campaign that having the Republican candidate running
for president say, `If I become president I'm going to freeze the
budget for four years?'''
   Robertson was in South Carolina, where he has declared he needs
a win in the March 5 primary. He announced his support for
legislation to limit textile imports and challenged Bush to do the
same.
   At Lander College in Greenwood, Robertson won applause when he
called for school prayer. It used to be, he said, that ``little
children could pray in the public schools of America and we've got
to see that once again.''
   Dole won the endorsement of South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond.
   The Kansas senator's campaign manager, former Sen. Bill Brock,
took several sharp jabs at Bush and his campaign. He accused the
vice president's campaign of taking two ``cheap shots'' before the
Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.
   He said the first attempt failed. The second one ``worked short
term. We'll see whether they worked in the long term,'' he said.

<HEAD>Navy Secretary Leaves with a Blast at His Boss</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 6th graf pvs, bgng: ``An administration ...'' to UPDATE
with Ball's likely nomination and Webb's resignation to be accepted
at White House Tuesday.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navy Secretary James H. Webb abruptly resigned
Monday, accusing Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci of abandoning
the Reagan Administration's goal of a 600-ship Navy and of
demonstrating a lack of leadership and vision.
   ``This building needs to be led,'' Webb said in telling
reporters of his decision. ``It needs leadership. It needs some
vision. I'm saying that if I had a piece of advice to give to
Secretary Carlucci, it would be to spend a lot more time with the
top leaders in this building.
   ``He's been spending a lot of time with the State Department and
a lot of time on the Hill. I think they (Pentagon leaders) need to
feel his vision and to understand what he believes in.''
   Webb, 42, a highly decorated Marine veteran of Vietnam combat
and the author of the best-selling Vietnam war novel, ``Fields of
Fire,'' left after only 10 months in his Pentagon position.
   He told President Reagan in his resignation letter that the
president could have realized his cherished goal of building a
600-ship fleet, were it not for Carlucci.
   An administration official who asked not to be identified said
Carlucci wants to recommend that William L. Ball III, assistant to
the president for legislative affairs, be nominated to replace
Webb. The source said the White House probably would announce
Ball's nomination on Tuesday, at the same time it announces formal
acceptance of Webb's resignation.
   Talking to reporters, Webb accused Carlucci of ordering him to
keep quiet about internal budget fighting, saying the defense chief
had written him a note saying he should deny news stories reporting
it was the Defense Department _ and not the Navy _ proposing to
mothball ships.
   ``Now, I'm not going to deny the truth,'' Webb said.
   Carlucci declined to respond to the criticism, issuing a written
statement saying only that he had learned of Webb's resignation
decision ``with regret.''
   The Pentagon added in a separate statement, however, that if
Webb had decided he could not ``defend the department's decisions''
on the budget, then ``under the circumstances, he has done the
honorable thing.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``Secretary
Carlucci is having to make some very difficult adjustments in the
Pentagon to accommodate budgetary reductions. Secretary Webb
indicates he is unable to operate under these constraints, but I
know the president feels he has given very valuable service to the
country ...''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Armed
Services subcommittee that oversees the Navy budget, said in a
statement: ``I'm sorry to see Jim Webb go. In his brief stint, he
impressed the Armed Services Committee as an able secretary.''
   ``Although I am not endorsing his views, his resignation has
obviously launched an important new stage of the debate about
Pentagon priorities and the size and type of Navy we need.''
   Three times, Webb said, the Navy developed a plan for cutting
its fiscal 1989 budget in such a way that the goal of expanding the
fleet to 600 ships could still be reached. And each time, he said,
the Navy's advice was ``ignored'' by Carlucci.
   ``I can only conclude that the decision to reduce the level of
our fleet to a point that it may never reach the 600-ship goal was
motivated by other than military and strategic reasoning,'' Webb
wrote Reagan.
   Webb and others have argued that 600 ships were the minimum
needed for the Navy to meet its worldwide commitments.
   Since his recommendations ``were rejected by your secretary of
defense, I am unable to support him personally or to defend this
amended budget during budget deliberations (in Congress),'' Webb
said.
   ``Consequently, I find it necessary to resign from my position
as ecretary of the Navy.''
   Webb's decision to step down surprised Navy and Pentagon
officials alike.
   He assumed the post only last April, seven months before
Carlucci succeeded Caspar W. Weinberger.
   The Navy, like all the services, was ordered in early December
to slash its fiscal 1989 budget proposal to comply with a new
deficit-reduction plan. Ultimately, Webb said, the Navy ended up
being told to cut $12.3 billion from its original spending plan.
   As finally approved by Carlucci, the Navy has told Congress it
wants $96.4 billion in budget authority and intends to mothball 16
Navy frigates, Webb said.
   The Pentagon said the mothballing would leave the Navy with 580
ships by the end of fiscal 1989 and that it can still build to 600
by fiscal 1992.
   Webb asserted, however, the mothballing is unnecessary and the
Navy would never reach 600 ships.
   ``One of the sad things about this is that this is one of the
few goals of the Reagan administration that was really obtainable,
at pretty low cost,'' Webb said.
   The Navy could have transferred those 16 frigates to the Naval
Reserve ``for well under $100 million'' rather than place them in
mothballs, preserving them as ``deployable'' warships ready for an
emergency, he declared.
   Webb declined to speculate on why Carlucci might have rejected
such options.
   But in another broadside at the new defense secretary, Webb
complained that once Carlucci arrived, ``the number of people who
are participating in the decisions (became) smaller.''
   Webb, one of the youngest men to ever become Navy secretary, is
a Naval Academy graduate.
   He came to the Pentagon in 1984 under Weinberger, assuming the
post of assistant defense secretary for reserve affairs. He had
resigned and was preparing to leave government service in early
1987 when the president asked him to replace John F. Lehman, the
first Navy secretary of the Reagan administration.
   Webb said Monday he intended to return to his work as a novelist
and possibly, journalism as well.

   Angry, defiant Palestinians
marked ``Martyrs' Day'' in the occupied territories Monday with
graveside speeches and stone-throwing demonstrations as they
remembered the 61 Arabs killed in clashes since December.
   Attorney General Yosef Harish meanwhile released a letter to
Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, criticizing Rabin's policy of
allowing soldiers to beat protesters.
   ``You cannot use force as a means of punishment, abuse or
humiliation,'' Harish said.
   One Palestinian was shot and wounded Monday in this West Bank
town 10 miles north of Jerusalem and another was shot during a
demonstration at Jabaliya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, according
to hospital sources. The army said it was checking the reports.
   Australian Foreign Minister Bill Hayden, attending a dinner in
Jerusalem with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, criticized Israel's
``sometimes arbitrary and violent way'' of dealing with the
disturbances.
   The Jersualem Post reported the International Committee of the
Red Cross in Geneva has strongly protested the Israeli actions.
   About 1,500 additional police officers, brought in from
throughout Israel, flooded Jerusalem in advance of the visit of
U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz, set to begin Thursday.
The reinforcements will back up the holy city's normal contingent
of 1,000 officers.
   Authorities fear Shultz's presence will lead to an upsurge in
violence by Arabs pressing their case for an end to 20 years of
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza, seized during the
1967 Middle East war.
   The latest spate of unrest started Dec. 8 and has resulted in
scores of deaths, hundreds of injuries and arrests.
   In Kfar Naami, a village of 2,000 inhabitants six miles west of
here, about 1,500 Arabs marched through the streets chanting
anti-Israeli and anti-American slogans.
   In a fiery speech at the graveside of one of the two village
residents who have died from army bullets, a speaker rejected the
Shultz trip.
   ``From this grave we condemn the Shultz visit and the United
States. These masses,'' he said gesturing to the crowd, ``are led
by the PLO. We will continue to achieve our goals and not satisfy
American policy in the region.''
   Grafitti in Kfar Naami read: ``No for the visit of Shultz; yes,
to the Palestinian government. Yes to the PLO.''
   Despite the rhetoric, Palestinian moderates are trying to
persuade PLO leader Yasser Arafat to lift his ban against local
Palestinians talking to Shultz. If Washington's peace plan is to
succeed, Shultz needs to bring Palestinians into the talks.
   In an interview Monday in Tunisia, Arafat said the Palestine
Liberation Organization was ready to meet with the United States.
   ``We have declared that we are ready to meet with all of the
permanent members of the Security Council, including the American
administration,'' Arafat said, speaking on CBS-TV's ``This
Morning.''
   ``Without a meeting with Palestinians, the Shultz initiative is
bound to fail,'' said Sari Nusseibeh, a university professor and
one of six Arabs originally slated to meet Shultz.
   Conservative Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has expressed strong
reservations about the American initiative. While saying he is
willing to listen and consider any ideas from Washington, he
clearly does not like the American initiative which revolves around
swapping land for peace. He also is worried about moving too
quickly.
   In a speech to European Jewish leaders Sunday night, Shamir said
a long period of practical experience and coexistence is needed
before the question of sovereignty can be broached.
   ``Any attempt to force the pace and to shorten the period would
be a detriment to the very essence of the (Camp David) agreement,''
he said.
   Army radio said Shamir told the Parliament's Foreign Affairs and
Security Committee Israel will not withdraw from the territories,
even under pressure.
   Shamir's Labor Party rival, Foreign Minister Peres, has largely
accepted the American initiative.
   ``In the upcoming days we will have a political discussion in
the Cabinet,'' Shamir told the radio Monday. ``Then we shall see
whether we (he and Peres) can talk to Mr. Shultz as partners or
not.''
   The radio quoted the prime minister as saying he and Peres could
be forced to call early elections because of their disagreements.
   Justice Ministry spokeswoman Etty Eshed said the attorney
general's letter was prompted by the many complaints received from
Palestinians in the territories.
   ``I checked them and found the number of the complaints ...
raised suspicion that defining these cases as `aberrations' does
not reflect reality,'' Harish wrote.
   Hayden, nearing the end of a Middle East tour, told Peres,
``Australians are deeply concerned by what's happening today in the
unrest in the occupied territories ... the sometimes arbitrary and
violent way in which it has been met.''
   In his response, Peres said Israel ``did not want to dominate''
the Palestinians and added: ``I know my country has been painfully
criticized by countries of the world. We take it seriously, with
chagrin.''
   The Jerusalem Post quoted Maurice Aubert, vice chairman of the
International Committee of the Red Cross, as saying a letter
recently was delivered to Israel's ICRC representative in Geneva
calling on Shamir ``to bring to an immediate end these serious acts
perpetrated against civilians.''
   It said the letter declared that ``thousands of people have been
the victims of brutality and grave ill-treatment at the hands of
Israeli soldiers.''

   Police increased patrols Monday at a
fundamentalist Christian television station that has been hit by
sporadic sniper fire twice in a week.
   No one was injured in the latest incident, on Sunday morning,
said WMPV-TV owner Ed Bowlds.
   ``We just think it's some kind of weirdo,'' Bowlds said. ``He's
not trying to hit anybody. That's obvious. It may be somebody
wanting publicity.''
   Glenda McLeod, a producer at the station, said one employee was
inside the building Sunday, but the shots were fired into the
eaves. She also said glass was broken in the front door, but not by
gunfire. She said she thought someone had attempted to break into
the building.
   Police placed the building under surveillance after bullets hit
it Wednesday. There have been no arrests in either incident.
   Police Capt. Tommy Hart said two additional patrol cars were
assigned to the area. He said the sniper could have been encouraged
by the station's on-the-air comment that officers seemed to take a
long time to arrive after the first shooting incident.
   Ms. McLeod said a caller Friday threatened the lives of four
employees, including herself and Bowlds.
   ``We just don't know what this crazy person is up to,'' the
producer said.
   Bowlds has reported other threatening calls since the station
opened three years ago.

   The new operators of United Press
International pledged Monday to reverse the news agency's financial
losses but said they have not decided how to achieve that goal.
   ``It's a dynamic situation now,'' Paul Steinle, UPI's new
president, said at a news conference. Hirings, firings and
management changes are frozen for the next four to six weeks while
the team draws up a business plan, he said.
   Dr. Earl W. Brian, chairman of WNW Group Inc., the media
investment group that assumed control of UPI late Friday, said he
and his associates will ``listen to everybody'' in devising a
survival plan for UPI.
   ``We are going to employ the best skills we have to come up with
a plan to take this business into the future,'' Brian said. ``And I
don't know what that is today.''
   Steinle, 48, said he believed the market would support two
general wire services, UPI and The Associated Press. ``I hope that
is true,'' he said, adding he would not know the answer until he
had interviewed current and potential clients.
   ``We think it can survive in some form or another,'' Steinle
said.
   Brian, 45, is a physician who served as health and welfare
commissioner in California under then-Gov. Ronald Reagan. He formed
WNW group for the purpose of taking control of stock owned by Mario
Vazquez Rana, the Mexican publisher.
   ``We purchased for cash _ a substantial cash payment _ an
irrevocable proxy for control of UPI,'' Brian said. Vazquez Rana
owns 95 percent of UPI.
   Brian refused to say how much money was involved over the
10-year agreement, but he said the amount Vazquez Rana receives
will be influenced by what WNW finds in its study.
   Vazquez Rana, who paid $41 million to bring UPI out of Chapter
11 protection proceedings in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in June 1986,
relinquished all control over the stock. Brian had waged an
unsuccessful effort to buy UPI before the company emerged from
Chapter 11.
   Brian and Steinle said Vazquez Rana reportedly sank $50 million
into UPI, which is thought to be losing about $1 million a month.
   While the new management studies UPI's financial picture and
talks with news executives around the country, Brian said his
company will underwrite UPI's losses. ``Yes, it's going to cost a
million a month to sit here and do a plan,'' he said.
   Brian said it is possible WNW may conclude there is no way to
turn around UPI's finances, which presumably could lead to shutting
down the agency. He called that scenario a ``low probability.''
   Brian is chairman of Infotechnology Inc., also known as
Infotech, an electronic communications company based in New York.
Infotech's subsidiaries include Financial News Network, a 24-hour
cable television service providing stock prices; Data Broadcasing
Corp.; Questech Capital Corp.; TV Value Mart Corp.; and Comtex
Scientific Corp.
   ``UPI is into a number of areas that are very synergistic to
what Infotech does,'' Brian said. They include computer
translations, electronic data base marketing and electronic
publishing.
   Infotech, which will be a minority shareholder in WNW, is a
public company. Brian owns about 13 percent of the company and
Merrill Lynch Co., owns about 14.5 percent.
   ``From Infotech's perspective, we see this as an investment
opportunity,'' Brian said. ``We believe this company has a value
greater than the amount of money it is losing.''
   Brian, who wore a UPI pin in his lapel, said he had other
reasons for wanting the company to survive.
   ``As a conservative Republican, as far as I'm concerned, UPI is
an extremely important asset to the American people,'' he told the
Los Angeles Times over the weekend.
   Once a plan is in hand, Brian said he will look for new
investors. They could include UPI's employees, he said. Ultimately,
Vazquez Rana's ownership share will be reduced by the infusion of
new stockholders, he said.
   Brian was prohibited from buying UPI outright partly because of
an agreement the Wire Service Guild, representing the agency's
editorial employees, made with Vazquez Rana. That deal calls for
the union to have the right of first refusal to buy UPI should
Vazquez Rana sell it.
   Dan Carmichael, a guild negotiator, said the union will ask
Brian to maintain the money-losing company as a ``general,
international news'' organization. The company has about 1,400
employees after laying off about 100 people in recent month.
   Representatives of the WSG and its parent, The Newspaper Guild,
met for about an hour and a half with Steinle on Monday. Carmichael
described the meeting as ``businesslike.''
   The guild asked for a copy of the financial deal between WNW and
Vazquez Rana as well as use of the company's internal message wire
for guild purposes.
   WSG President Kevin Keane told Steinle that the UPI work force
is unsettled because of the fequent turmoil, and allowing the union
to communicate with staffers on a timely basis would boost morale,
he said.
   Steinle said he could not guarantee there would not be layoffs
in the future, but he noted a freeze was in effect, a WSG statement
said.
   Al Rossiter Jr., UPI's executive editor, said ``morale has
soared'' since the staff learned of the deal. ``I am very
optimistic,'' he said.
   Steinle, a former president of Financial News Network, has a
long career in journalism, mainly the broadcast industry. Before
joining FNN in 1983, he was a news director of KING-TV in Seattle,
Wash., and at WIXT-TV in Syracuse, N.Y.
   A native of Chillicothe, Ohio, he has also worked for
Westinghouse Broadcasting Corp., between 1969 and 1974, covering
events in both Hong Kong and Saigon. He has an MBA from Harvard
Business School.
   UPI was formed in June 1907 by The E.W. Scripps Co., which sold
the wire service in 1982 to Media News Corp. The company filed for
protection from creditors in April 1985, more than a year before it
was bought by Vazquez Rana.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Challenging Sentencing Guidelines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Monday dismissed a lawsuit
challenging the constitutionality of new sentencing guidelines,
ruling that two public defender offices lacked legal standing to
bring the case.
   The decision by U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin dismissed
the case on technical grounds. It came four days after two federal
judges in California had held the new sentencing guidelines were
unconstitutional.
   The two judges in San Diego ruled that the 1984 law establishing
the U.S. Sentencing Commission was unconstitutional because it
improperly placed the panel in the judicial instead of the
executive branch in violation of the constitution's
separation-of-powers doctrine.
   Unlike the California cases, the suit before Sporkin did not
involve defendants who faced sentencing under the new guidelines,
which provide a complicated set of factors for determining the
length of a defendant's incarceration.
   Sporkin found that federal public defenders' offices in San
Diego and Nashville lacked legal standing to sue because they
couldn't show they were harmed by the new sentencing guidelines.
   ``Permitting lawyers to sue without clients, or at best, with
only potential clients, merely because their putatative clients
allegedly will be harmed, would open the same door for specialist
lawyers to sue whenever Congress enacts a statute which impacts on
their clientele,'' Sporkin said.
   ``The harm alleged by plaintiffs... essentially boils down to
their perception that their workload will be more complex and will
markedly increase,'' Sporkin said.
   ``That sort of `harm' or `injury' is no different from the
`harm' that the passage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 caused for
tax laywers, or for that matter than the `harm' caused for criminal
lawyers by the passage of the Bail Reform and Speedy Trial Acts,''
the judge said.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The kidnappers of a U.S. Marine officer
released a videotape Monday in which he recited their demands,
including withdrawal by Israel from its border ``security zone'' in
south Lebanon.
   Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, who appeared to be reading from a
text written by his captors, said President Reagan ``has to take
responsibility for the crimes he has committed against the
oppressed people in the region.''
   Higgins was abducted last Wednesday on a highway south of Tyre,
the ancient port 50 miles south of Beirut.
   A group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on
Earth, which claimed responsibility for the abduction, released the
70-second tape.
   The kidnapping increased friction between two Shiite Moslem
forces vying for domination in south Lebanon: the moderate Amal
militia, which is trying to rescue Higgins, and Hezbollah, or Party
of God, which is loyal to Iran and is believed to be an umbrella
for groups holding most of the 25 foreigners missing in Lebanon.
   Amal militiamen and troops of the U.N. peacekeeping force in
south Lebanon, using dogs, searched the caves and groves of the
Tyre area for the sixth day Monday.
   NBC Nightly News reported ``important progress in the search.''
In a report from southern Lebanon it said sources there told NBC
News the three gunmen who kidnapped Higgins and three other gunmen
who were in the getaway car have been caught.
   It said the six are being interrogated by Amal officers.
   Higgins is commander of the 76-man Observer Group-Lebanon
attached to the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, or UNIFIL, the south
Lebanon peacekeeping force.
   Hezbollah claimed the 43-year-old Marine from Danville, Ky., was
removed from the area despite a dragnet by Amal and U.N. security
officers. Release of the tape, delivered to a Western news agency
in Beirut, suggested the abductors were able to get Higgins out.
   ``It is hard to believe that a videotape can be produced if the
captive is held in a dangerous hideout,'' said an independent,
informed Shiite source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Amal, which supports the U.N. presence in predominantly Shiite
south Lebanon, views Higgins' abduction as a Hezbollah challenge.
Security sources in Tyre said Amal had closed the Iranian cultural
center and Iranian Revolutionary Guards offices in the city.
   Hezbollah declared full support for the kidnappers and denounced
Amal's ``enthusiam to determine the fate of a filthy American spy.''
   Nine Americans, including Higgins, are among the 25 foreigners
missing in Lebanon. The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, kidnapped
March 16, 1985.
   Many of his taped remarks were in poor English, indicating he
did not write the message. His face was close to the camera,
obscuring any background that might have indicated the location.
   He appeared physically fit, was unshaven and wore the same dark
green sweater as when kidnappers stopped his car on the coastal
highway.
   A typewritten statement in Arabic that accompanied the tape
renewed the charge that Higgins was a CIA agent using the U.N. job
as a cover.
   Washington has denied this.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday the videotape
``obviously ... was made under duress.''
   To begin the statement, the kidnapped Marine said:
   ``I, William Higgins, in order to get me released, these demands
have to be met.''
   He recited the same conditions his captors set forth in a
statement on Friday claiming responsibility for the abduction:
   _Withdrawal of Israeli forces from the zone they maintain just
north of the frontier as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla
raids.
   _Release of all Lebanese and Palestinian guerrillas from the
Khiam prison and ``all other prisons inside the Zionist regime in
occupied Palestine.'' Israel holds about 300 Lebanese and
Palestinians at Khiam in the security zone.
   _An end to U.S. intervention in Lebanon and to Middle East
missions by American emissaries.
   While giving the last condition, Higgins said the aim of U.S.
missions to the Middle East was to ``surround the gains of the
Islamic revolution in occupied Palestine.''
   That suggested the kidnappers wanted Secretary of State George
P. Shultz to cancel a scheduled trip this week in which he is to
visit Jordan, Egypt and Israel, and may go to Syria and Saudi
Arabia.
   Shultz was in Moscow on Monday, where the Middle East situation
was figuring in his talks.
   UNIFIL spokesman Timur Goksel has said 20 officers of Higgings'
group were withdrawn from three border posts after his abduction to
the force's headquarters in Naqoura, a Lebanese town just north of
the Israeli border.
   The U.N. Relief and Works Agency evacuated its last five foreign
employees from Moslem west Beirut to the Christian eastern sector
Monday because of the kidnappings Feb. 5 of employees Jan Stening,
44, of Sweden and William Jorgensen, 58, of Norway.

<HEAD>Japan Asks U.S. to Reconsider Whaling Sanction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Japan is asking the United States to
reconsider its charges that a Japanese ``scientific research''
whaling expedition in the Antarctic is undermining international
agreements, the Japanese Embassy said Monday.
   Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga sent Secretary of State George Shultz
a letter accusing the United States of taking ``unilateral action''
and ``unjustifiable measures'' in the whaling dispute, an embassy
statement said.
   It referred to a Feb. 10 Commerce Department declaration that
Japan's killing of minke whales in the Antarctic violated
international whaling agreements. The declaration means that
President Reagan by April can order a 50 percent cut in the
Japanese fishing quota in U.S. economic territorial waters and
exclude Japanese fish and fish products from U.S. markets.
   The current Japanese fishing quota in the 200-mile offshore U.S.
economic zone is zero but the declaration could be applied to
future years as well as apply to sales of processed fish.
   Matsunaga's letter restated the Japanese government position
that the current Antarctic expedition is for non-commercial
research ``provided for in the International Whaling Commission
Convention.'' The United States and Japan agreed in 1984 that Japan
would cease commercial whaling in 1987.
   Critics say that proposed harvest of hundreds of minke whales is
excessive for research, that the commission has not specifically
authorized the current expedition and that the stated research into
whale population, diet and nutrition could be carried out without
killing the whales.
   The Embassy said Matsunaga in his letter, dated Friday,
``strongly urged the U.S. to reconsider its position in light of
the damage these moves would cause to mutually beneficial
U.S.-Japan fishery relations.''

   The saga of the television evangelists has come full circle with
the disgrace of Jimmy Swaggart, who a year ago was the scourge of
lust and greed among the ``pompadour boys'' in the religious
broadcasting fraternity.
   The scandal strikes an electronic church which has already been
measurably diminished by last year's controversies over Jim
Bakker's adultery and high living and Oral Roberts' claim that God
might ``take me home'' if he failed to raise $8 million by the end
of March.
   ``My feeling is that there will be more damage, and the
credibility of those of us in Christian broadcasting will be hurt a
little bit more. How much, I don't know,'' said Jerry Rose,
president of National Religious Broadcasters.
   Rose, of WCFC-TV in Chicago, noted that Swaggart had been a
vigorous proponent of the NRB's efforts to improve financial
accountability, as well as an emphatic preacher about sexual
morality.
   ``A lot of people saw Jimmy as a pacesetter for doing what
needed to done in the church, so in this case it is shocking,''
Rose said.
   As Bakker resigned in shame a year ago, Swaggart thundered:
``God deliver us from these pompadour boys, hair done, nails done,
fresh from the beauty shop, preaching the gospel.''
   Even before Swaggart's recent problems, the name-calling among
these men of God and the jokes of late-night comedians had moved
Pat Robertson, now a Republican presidential contender, to say that
he resented being identified as a ``television evangelist.''
   Swaggart _ by some measures, the biggest of them all _ stepped
down from his pulpit Sunday after confessing that he had sinned
against God and his family. He didn't explain, but others reported
that the Louisiana evangelist had been photographed entering a
motel room with a prostitute.
   ``We're the last surviving ministry, the last one,'' the Rev.
Jerry Falwell told students at his Liberty University in Lynchburg,
Va., on Sunday. ``Bakker is gone. Robertson is gone ... running for
president. Swaggart is now gone. We're the last. The credibility
crisis is unbelievable.''
   With that crisis came hard times for the television ministry.
Falwell, Swaggart and Roberts all have lost part of their audience,
and Robertson laid off nearly 500 employees at his Christian
Broadcasting Network last summer and 145 more in November.
   CBN's contribution income dropped by 32.5 percent from April to
October, said Benton Miller, the ministry's director of
communications. Not only did the PTL scandal hurt, Miller said, but
falling oil prices cut into the income of some supporters and the
stock market dived in October.
   ``There was a real drought for a good bit of last year,'' said
Falwell's spokesman, Mark deMoss, who predicted Monday that there
may be little or no impact this time.
   ``Part of that is due to the way Jimmy Swaggart has handled his
admission of wrongdoing,'' deMoss said. ``I think another reason
for that is, thanks in great part to the media, the general public
now has a better understanding of the difference between a
charismatic and non-charismatic ministry and now is able to tell
the difference from one ministry to another.
   ``I look at the example of a Gary Hart moral failure _ that did
not ruin the Democratic party or other Democratic candidates, but
it did ruin Gary Hart,'' deMoss said.
   Falwell, Moral Majority's founder, is an independent Baptist and
a fundamentalist. Charismatics may share his Biblical literalism,
but they emphasize ``gifts of the spirit'' such as speaking in
tongues and healing.
   Bakker and Swaggart were both ordained by the Assemblies of God,
a charismatic denomination.
   Swaggart had a larger audience, 1,720,000 households per week
last November, than any other video evangelist, according to the
Arbitron rating service. The A.C. Nielsen Co. put Swaggart's
audience at 860,000 households, second to Robert Schuller's
1,189,000, but Nielsen said Swaggart was seen on the most stations,
286.
   Arbitron reported that Swaggart's audience had been 2,161,000
households in February of last year, before the PTL and Oral
Roberts controversies. Between February and November last year,
Arbitron said, Schuller's audience dropped from 1.7 million
households to 1.4 million, Roberts from 1.15 million to 900,000,
and Falwell's ``Old Time Gospel Hour'' from 616,000 to 495,000.
   Those figures are for broadcast audience only; most programs
reach additional viewers on cable television.
   The negative publicity started last year when Roberts, who had
built an evangelistic empire including a university and a hospital
in Tulsa, Okla., announced that God might ``call me home'' if he
did not raise $8 million by the end of March.
   Bakker resigned March 19, 1987, after admitting a sexual
encounter with a young woman later identified as Jessica Hahn.
Bakker said he had asked Falwell to take over, but later claimed
that Falwell had stolen PTL.
   Bakker and his top aide, the Rev. Richard Dortch, were
subsequently defrocked by the Assemblies of God.
   The story popped up through the year. The Bakkers feuded with
Falwell, who finally resigned in frustration in October. Jessica
Hahn turned up in the pages of Playboy, and in the mansion of Hugh
Hefner.
   In December, the Internal Revenue Service claimed that the
Bakkers had been paid $9.36 million in excessive compensation
between 1981 and 1987.
   This month, PTL's new trustee, David Clark, filed suit against
the Bakkers and former aide David Taggart, seeking $52.8 million
for mismanagement and unjustified compensation.
   Bakker's 81-year-old parents, Raleigh and Furnia Bakker, were
laid off last week from their $500-a-month jobs as greeters at the
Heritage USA resort, where they have continued to live.
   This month, members of the National Religious Broadcasters
adopted a financial code of ethics which will require public
disclosure of annual, independent audits of all income and
expenditures, except for salaries.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The army chief of staff denied
Monday night that the commander of Haiti's most repressive and
powerful batallion is involved in cocaine trafficking.
   ``There has been no complaint or judicial file received
implicating Col. Jean-Claude Paul, who has been singled out by the
foreign press'' for denigration, read the communique signed by Gen.
Carl Nicolas and broadcast by the state-run Radio Nationale.
   Paul is the target of a U.S. federal grand jury probe based on
the testimony of Oswaldo Quintana, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency
informant who charged that Paul uses his private airstrip and ranch
outside Port-au-Prince to smuggle cocaine from Columbia to Florida.
   The army statement refuted the ``so-called involvement of (Paul)
in affairs of drug trafficking,'' and denounced the foreign press
for its ``campaign of denigration'' against Paul, who is in his
late 40s.
   The statement also warned the local press not to repeat
``unfounded rumors'' of the foreign press.
   Several opposition newspapers reported with banner headlines a
news conference given by Quintana in Miami last week implicating
Paul as a cocaine smuggler.
   The communique stated that if the army high command has reason
to believe that any army officer is guilty of misconduct, ``an
investigating committee will be created, in accordance with the
regulations of the Armed Forces of Haiti.''
   Paul's unit, the widely feared Dessalines Barracks, is
responsible for virtually all army repression and killings of
demonstrators in 1987. Soldiers from the 700-man batallion were
also seen in the streets during the violently-aborted Nov. 29
elections, apparerently protecting gunmen who shot or hacked to
death at least 34 voters.

<HEAD>Dublin Government To Launch Own Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former parish priest of an
Irish nationalist who was shot dead from an army observation tower
said Monday that police and soldiers harrassed the victim for
several years.
   British officials said they have launched an investigation into
the incident Sunday in Northern Ireland near the Irish border. But
in Dublin, the Irish government announced it will hold its own
probe headed by the deputy Irish police chief.
   McAnespie's death came at a time of severe strain in Anglo-Irish
relations over other incidents involving the police and the
province's Catholic minority.
   The Rev. Brendan McHugh said Aidan McAnespie had to cross the
Irish border daily to go to work and was constantly harassed at the
army checkpoint.
   ``We complained time out of number to the police and military,
but no action was ever taken. Life for the poor man had just become
unbearable,'' he told reporters.
   The army said it ``deeply regrets'' the shooting. It said
23-year-old McAnespie was hit by a bullet fired from an army
observation post about half a mile from the Irish border in County
Tyrone.
   Police said the soldier involved was in military custody while
an investigation was launched. No details about the soldier were
given. Police declined to comment on the priest's allegations of
harassment.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said
security sources reported that the soldier involved told detectives
a machine gun was accidentally discharged as he handed it to
another soldier.
   The agency also quoted unidentified sources as saying three
strike marks were found on the roadway near the victim, indicating
three shots might have been fired.
   McAnespie's brother-in-law, Paul McCabe, said of the
investigation announced by the Dublin government: ``We welcome any
attempt to bring the murderer of Aidan to real justice and ensure
that there is not yet another cover-up.
   ``Maybe at this late stage the Irish government will finally
recognize the reality of families like ourselves having to put up
with constant harassment. ... In the light of recent developments
of incidents here (in Northern Ireland) I do not think anyone would
be prepared to give evidence to the RUC.''
   The RUC _ Royal Ulster Constabulary _ is Northern Ireland's
police force. Its policemen are frequent targets of Irish
Republican Army gunmen and bombers. Allegations that the RUC tried
to thwart an investigation into the slaying of six unarmed
Catholics by an RUC unit in 1982 has intensified the deep hostility
among many Catholics toward the force.
   The outlawed IRA is fighting to end British rule in
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland and unite the province with
the Irish Republic, which is predominantly Roman Catholic.
   Relatives said McAnespie was walking to a regular weekly Gaelic
football game in the Northern Ireland village of Aughnacloy, County
Tyrone, when he was shot. He had passed through the checkpoint,
which lies on the route to the football ground.
   Francis Molloy, a local councilman, said McAnespie was an
election worker for Sinn Fein, political arm of the IRA. The IRA
denied McAnespie was among their members.
   McHugh said McAnespie was never involved in paramilitary
activity but was harassed nevertheless.
   ``He was never abused physically, just verbally, and his car was
often taken apart,'' McHugh said, referring to vehicle searches.
``I don't know why he was singled out for such treatment.''
   ``The campaign against him must have been going on for at least
five years. Other young lads were also stopped, but Aidan appeared
to be getting special treatment,'' he said.
   Last month Britain provoked Irish outrage by saying it will not
prosecute policemen accused of perverting the course of justice in
the aftermath of the killing of six unarmed Catholics in three
incidents in late 1982.
   The strain was compounded by a British appeals court's refusal
to overturn the conviction of six Irishmen accused of perpetrating
twin bombings that killed 21 people in 1974. Many Irish officials
and civilians believe the six are victims of a miscarriage of
justice.

   Republican presidential hopeful Pat
Robertson said Monday that ``somebody planned'' the eruption of a
scandal involving television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart two weeks
before the Super Tuesday primaries. But he wouldn't say who he was
talking about.
   ``Nothing happens to people by accident,'' Robertson, a former
television evangelist, said in an interview Monday with the
Anderson, S.C., Independent-Mail. ``It is kind of funny this came
up two weeks before the most important primaries in the nation.
People probably wonder what went on.''
   Swaggart temporarily stepped down from the pulpit of his
7,500-member church in Baton Rouge, La., on Sunday amid allegations
of sexual misconduct.
   ``I think somebody had something to do with it,'' said
Robertson. ``Somebody else planned all these things, I am afraid.''
   Robertson declined to say who he was referring to, but said the
``political efforts'' will have little effect on his campaign
because his supporters back him too strongly.
   ``It (the scandal) will not affect me because it has nothing
whatsoever to do with me,'' he told the newspaper. ``But I want to
tell people to ask (Vice President) George Bush what he thinks
about all this.''
   Earlier Monday, Robertson had said the troubles Swaggart is
having are ``unfortunate,'' but that he didn't think the
controversy would have any effect on his campaign.
   ``It will have no more effect on me than Gary Hart had on Robert
Dole,'' he said. Hart dropped out of the Democratic presidential
race in May amid reports of his relationship with a Miami model,
then rejoined the field in December.
   In the interview with the Anderson newspaper, Robertson accused
the Bush campaign of ``dirty politics'' and ``trickery'' directed
at his campaign, but offered no proof of such activity.
   ``I have been told of Bush's dirty tricks and I expect to see
them in South Carolina,'' he said. ``His campaign will use every
kind of dirty trick against me because this state is important and
I have a lot of support and George Bush knows that.''
   Bush campaign officials were not immediately available to
respond to Robertson's comments.
   Also on Monday, Robertson called for a return to teaching
methods used 40 years ago, when children could still pray in public
schools.
   Back then, ``We maybe didn't have some of the fancy buildings
and we weren't spending $270 billion a year on education, but
little children could pray in the public schools of America and
we've got to see that once again,'' he said to applause from a
group of about 800 people at Lander College.
   Robertson said in recent math tests, American students performed
just above students in Swaziland. ``Twenty-five percent of the
students in one test couldn't even locate the United States of
America on a map. How can you defend a country when you don't even
know where it is?''
   He said American education should once again stress the basics
such as the multiplication tables, science, geography and American
history.

<HEAD>Sources Say Switchman In Amtrak Accident Tested Positive For Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Amtrak switchman who fled his post after a
derailment injured 25 passengers last month has tested positive for
marijuana and at least one other drug, officials familiar with the
tests said Monday night.
   However, one of the officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said authorities had not determined whether a link
existed between the Jan. 29 accident and the results of the tests
on Thomas Connor, 30, of Aldan, Pa.
   He said the laboratory that performed the tests has been asked
to clarify the analysis, and the correlation remained ``an open
issue.'' He said he could not identify any other drugs that had
been found.
   Connor was the control tower operator on duty when the train
slammed into a work vehicle in Chester, Pa., near Philadelphia. He
fled his post after realizing he had failed to take the train off a
stretch of track undergoing maintenance.
   Connor did not submit to blood or urine tests until more than 72
hours after the accident. Marijuana can remain in the system for up
to 30 days.
   Connor's lawyer, Arthur Donato of suburban Philadelphia, said he
had not been notified of the results.
   ``I don't believe it,'' Donato said, referring to the sources'
report.
   John Jacobsen, an Amtrak spokesman, said the railroad also had
not been informed of the results.
   The NBC Nightly News reported Monday night that sources had
found Connor tested positive for high amounts of marijuana, cocaine
and a third unidentified drug.
   Bill Loftus, spokesman of the Federal Railroad Administration,
said he could neither comfirm nor deny any reports about the drug
tests, pending notification to Connor and Amtrak.
   Loftus did confirm that the results had been received and said
the railroad administration expected to issue a report on Tuesday.
He said the findings were ``not simple.''
   Connor was suspended without pay by Amtrak, then resigned last
week, citing ``physical and emotional stress.''
   Calls to Connor's home were not answered Monday night.

   The Israeli army, which shot and killed two
more Arabs in the West Bank, said Secretary of State George P.
Shultz's visit this week could lead to an escalation of violence in
the occupied territories.
   In another development, a U.S. official, speaking Sunday on
condition of anonymity, said an American envoy has discussed the
Shultz visit with local Palestinians. According to Arab and other
American sources, Watt Cluvarius, a deputy to Assistant Secretary
of State Richard Murphy, met Saturday with a group of about 10
Palestinians from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization on Friday ordered
Palestinians from the occupied lands not to talk to Shultz. But Dr.
Yasser Obeid, one of those who met with Cluvarius, said the
participants hoped PLO chief Yasser Arafat would change his mind
and allow such discussions.

   Church leaders left the door open for
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart to resume his TV ministry after he
delivered a tearful confession of sin and stepped down from the
pulpit.
   ``I think he is a man of integrity. I think he made a mistake. I
don't think it's a fatal mistake,'' Cecil Janway, district
superintendent of the 2 million-member Assemblies of God, said late
Sunday.
   Swaggart did not describe his misconduct Sunday in his
confession, which drew gasps and tears from his congregation. An
overflow crowd packed his 7,500-seat family worship center after
reports that church officials had been given photographs purporting
to show Swaggart and a known prostitute going into and out of a
motel room.

of hunger plaguing the nation's homeless and families living in
poverty.
   ``I know that the budget pressures will remain with us all this

``But America's future depends on its children. The wealthiest,

   The hearings come as the government prepares to suspend

land-based atomic weapons.
   And in the latest round _ on a possible successor to the MX
missile _ past administration critics have gained grudging support

Carlucci has agreed to request enough funding to keep the project

   Democrat Richard Gephardt, who has made
``It's your fight too'' his populist rally cry, has chosen this
state as a staging ground for a bid to block Michael Dukakis from
sweeping the handful of states holding presidential primaries or
caucuses before Super Tuesday.
   South Dakota, and to a lesser extent Wyoming, are the states
chosen by the Gephardt campaign for an intensive effort even as the
three-week campaign for the South and its rich pool of delegates
has already begun.
   According to the calendar and the Democratic Party's nomination
rules, South Dakota might not appear a major battleground. Its
primary was set for Tuesday, earlier than national Democratic
officials wanted it, only after agreement was reached that means
the state's nominating delegates won't be selected until later and
won't be bound by the primary outcome.

   Premier Jacques Chirac, long mired in third
place in opinion polls, has seen his presidential campaign take
off, giving him an edge over rival conservative Raymond Barre with
two months left before the vote.
   The first round of the election, April 24, has become in effect
a primary election between Chirac and Barre. Unless there is a
stunning turnaround, one of the two will oppose a Socialist,
probably incumbent President Francois Mitterrand, in the decisive
May 8 runoff for a seven-year term.
   Mitterrand has long had a solid lead in all published opinion
surveys, while Chirac trailed Barre thoughout last year. A poll
published Jan. 16, the day Chirac declared his candidacy, gave
Mitterrand 41 percent to 25 percent for Barre and 18.5 percent for
Chirac.
   But surveys published in the past two weeks have shown Chirac
pushing ahead. Friday's edition of the magazine Paris-Match, for
exampale, reported 23 percent of those questioned planning to vote
for Chirac, to 19 percent for Barre. Mitterrand, who says he will
wait until mid-March to disclose his plans, remained far ahead with
36 percent.

   Navy Secretary James H. Webb abruptly resigned
Monday, accusing Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci of abandoning
the Reagan Administration's goal of a 600-ship Navy and of
demonstrating a lack of leadership and vision.
   ``This building needs to be led,'' Webb said in telling
reporters of his decision. ``It needs leadership. It needs some
vision. I'm saying that if I had a piece of advice to give to
Secretary Carlucci, it would be to spend a lot more time with the
top leaders in this building.
   ``He's been spending a lot of time with the State Department and
a lot of time on the Hill. I think they (Pentagon leaders) need to
feel his vision and to understand what he believes in.''
   Webb, 42, a highly decorated Marine veteran of Vietnam combat
and the author of the best-selling Vietnam war novel, ``Fields of
Fire,'' left after only 10 months in his Pentagon position.

   Cafe owner Yosef Weizman said when
Israeli police beat up his Arab workers three days ago, he
understood the depth of distrust between Jews and Arabs after
months of clashes in the occupied territories.
   Eli Ben-Simon, 38, had learned the lesson a few days earlier.
Ben-Simon, a Jew, was beaten up in an industrial area near Tel Aviv
because, he said, his Israeli attackers thought he was an Arab.
   Growing numbers of Palestinians who work in and around this
coastal city of 1.5 million people are subject to harassment,
primarily by Israelis made suspicious by the unprecedented fury and
violence of Arabs opposing Israel's 20-year occupation in the West

lust and greed among the ``pompadour boys'' in the religious

   The scandal strikes an electronic church which has already been

Bakker's adultery and high living and Oral Roberts' claim that God
might ``take me home'' if he failed to raise $8 million by the end
of March.
   ``God deliver us from these pompadour boys, hair done, nails

   His remarks to the National Governors' Association were labeled
a disappointment by Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, a

   Reagan instead said he still strongly supports a less costly
Republican alternative that the House rejected two months ago.

care, where both Democrats and Republicans in Congress are

<HEAD>Chuck Berry Honored At Berlin Film Festival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHANIE GRIFFITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Move over Maybellene. Roll over Beethoven. Berlin
is hail, hail, hailing rock 'n' roll legend Chuck Berry.
   The critically-acclaimed movie, ``Chuck Berry: Hail! Hail! Rock
'n' Roll,'' led the pack of American films forming the centerpiece
of this year's Berlin Film Festival.
   And Berry, the father of rock 'n' roll who inspired such
musicians as Elvis Presley and the Beatles, was the American star
feted first at this year's event, Europe's No. 2 annual cinema
extravaganza after the more prestigious Cannes Film Festival.
   Berry was presented with a life achievement award at the West
German premier of ``Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll,'' the movie directed
by Taylor Hackford (``White Nights,'' ``An Officer and a
Gentleman'') that made its American debut at the New York Film
Festival in the fall.
   The Berlinale Camera award, a gold replica of a camera, was
presented to Berry at the premiere by Voker Hassemer, West Berlin's
Senator for Cultural Affairs.
   ``I don't consider myself a legend,'' the 62-year-old Berry
said. ``I always thought a legend was a dead person who is
praised.''
   The St. Louis-born Berry wrote such hard-hitting, foot stomping
songs as ``Maybellene,'' ``Sweet Little Sixteen,'' ``School Day,''
``Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll,'' ``Roll Over Beethoven'' and ``Rock
'n' Roll Music.''
   The movie, a two-hour biographical concert show, is the sixth
film in which the rock star has appeared. It features Berry's
daughter, Ingrid, as a back-up singer, blues singer Etta James and
pop star Linda Ronstadt. Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards,
the film's musical producer, also makes an appearance.
   Berry is known for his stage showmanship, from the skillfull
handling of the guitar to his flashy dance improvisations. It is
this stage savvy that sets him apart from other performers, he says.
   ``There's a special sense that I think I have as a performer,''
he said. ``I know when I have to change the pace, when I see the
audience looking tired.''
   But age has forced him to change his performance over the years,
he says.
   ``As you get older and older, you find out what's better to do''
he said. ``Over the last 10 years the dancing in my shows has
diminished, but the presence has developed.''
   Berry was a hit with both older and younger fans in Berlin. He
was mobbed by throngs of fans and autograph seekers upon arriving
at the city's Tegel Airport, and a sold-out crowd gathered to see
him perform at the ``Metropole,'' one of the city's hottest night
spots.
   But the singer says he's had enough fame.
   ``I don't care for any more fame than I had a few years ago,''
said Berry, who cut a lean, lithe figure in his light blue vest and
string tie. ``I don't think I really deserve it.''
   Berry said he owes his skills as a lyricist to his early
exposure to poetry.
   ``I grew up with poetry'' he said. ``From the time I was 8 years
old, I'd be learning different poems. It was a family thing. My
older sisters and I would have contests to see who could tell the
best poems.''
   In recent years the Berlin Film Festival has favored splashy,
Hollywood-style productions after years of honoring art-oriented
works of little commercial draw. This year's offerings included
``Broadcast News,'' ``Wall Street,'' ``Walker'' and ``Moonstruck.''
   Some 750 short and feature-length films from more than 100
nations were shown during the 11-day festival, which ended Feb. 23.
Woody Allen's ``September'' kicked off the festival.

   If loyal fans of ABC's ``Moonlighting'' are
gluttons for punishment, that may be an asset for watching the show
this season.
   Not within memory have television viewers had to put up with so
much and gotten so little.
   ``Moonlighting'' is the most disappointing show this season, and
for those who loved the show it is a terrible thing to see it
self-destruct right on the screen.
   What made this show go, what gave it its charm and appeal, were
the scenes between Cybill Shepherd as Maddie Hayes and Bruce Willis
as David Addison. These two opposites, irresistibly drawn to each
other in a love-hate relationship, made the screen sparkle with
their witty repartee.
   But Shepherd's pregnancy caused a dilemma for the show's
producers. Instead of shooting around it, as most series do, they
made it a part of the story. Allyce Beasley, who plays Miss
Dipesto, was also pregnant, but on the show she ignored it.
Besides, with her layered look, it was hard to tell.
   It might have seemed a smart move at the time to incorporate
Shepherd's pregnancy into the story. But it has turned into labor
for the viewers.
   Maddie, telling no one she was pregnant, went off to Chicago to
brood with her parents. David was left to deal with her absence.
   ``Moonlighting'' was left to slowly twist in the wind.
   It was embarrassing watching the show deal with her absence. It
squirmed and made up stories like someone caught in a lie. The
whole point of watching ``Moonlighting'' was to see those two carry
on like Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn in ``Woman of the
Year.'' The cases they solved were merely an excuse to get them
together so they could disagree.
   And when Shepherd and Willis finally got back together, it
wasn't any better. Forget the witty dialogue. ``Moonlighting''
turned into ``Days of Whine and Roses.''
   Although Shepherd had twins, Maddie is still pregnant. She told
David the baby's not his.
   But the clincher was when she announced she had married a
stranger _ a whole new character, Dennis Dugan as a businessman she
met on the train from Chicago _ on impulse. Maddie, married on
impulse? Maddie, the woman who wouldn't cross the street on
impulse? David is standing there with egg on his face, trying to
grin through it. What a low blow. What a letdown for the audience.
   Where is the famous ``Dallas'' shower when we need it? Tell us
the season was only a dream and not a nightmare.
   Maddie and David have become an unfunny, bickering couple who
have overstayed their welcome. It was nice while it lasted, but the
magic is gone.
   Meanwhile, ABC has removed another show from its schedule.
``Sledge Hammer!'' a spoof on all those macho detectives, started
out in the Nielsen cellar and never got out. The show deserved
better.
   It made its debut in September 1986 against CBS' ``Dallas'' and
NBC's ``Miami Vice.'' After that introduction to obscurity, ABC
transferred the show to 8 o'clock Thursday, where it went up
against NBC's ``The Cosby Show.'' There it stayed until it was
moved again, back to Friday against ``Dallas'' and ``Miami Vice.''
   David Rasche stars as the title character, a one-man anti-crime
crusade, whose idea of crime prevention is shooting a jaywalker.
The show has parodied such movies as ``Vertigo,'' ``Play It Again,
Sam,'' ``A Clockwork Orange,'' ``Dressed To Kill'' and ``Robocop.''
   It's a funny show, although its brand of satire may be difficult
for some people to understand. But the main reason the show never
gained an audience was its time period. It has never had a chance.
   ABC says it will bring the show back later. It deserves a chance
to be seen by a wider audience and not merely to be brought back in
another bad time slot to play out its commitment.

<HEAD>Stakes High in `Rhino War' on TBS</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It isn't easy to make a rhinoceros look noble,
tragic, even charming, but producer-writer Philip Cayford does just
that in his stunning National Geographic special, ``The Rhino War.''
   ``That was part of what I was trying to do, tried to make them
look attractive, tried to make them look cuddly, because they're
not very cuddly and attractive, and they're not very appealable,
but they can be,'' said Cayford, a British filmmaker and
conservationist, during a recent visit to New York.
   The one-hour documentary, shot in Kenya and Zimbabwe last year,
airs Sunday on SuperStation TBS. It is narrated by Richard Kiley
and features music by Ladysmith Black Mombazo.
   Cayford has serious reasons for doing rhino PR. Of the more than
30 species of rhinoceros that once existed on the African
continent, only five remain, and all are endangered, especially the
black rhino. In the early 1970s, there were 65,000 rhinos in
Africa. Now there are 4,500.
   Says a park ranger in Zimbabwe, ``You do not want to show to
your children one day how an elephant or a rhino look in a
storybook.''
   ``Ironically,'' notes Cayford in the film's narration, ``the
very feature that evolved for the animal's defense may bring about
its extinction.''
   Poachers are killing rhinos for the horn. A rhino's horn is
caratin, like a human fingernail. The easiest way to remove it is
to kill the animal.
   Contrary to popular belief, rhino horn powder is not primarily
sought as an aphrodisiac, but rather in the Far East as a supposed
fever reducer.
   More recently, however, conservationists uncovered an alarming
new market for much of the rhino horn _ North Yemen, where
rhino-horn dagger handles are symbols of virility that command up
to $15,000. In the oil-rich country, there is plenty of money for
such extravangances.
   In Africa, the battle to save the rhino has in fact become a
war, complete with soldiers, helicopters, guns and death. The
enemies, notes Cayford, are ``greed, corruption and ignorance.''
   In Zimbabwe, where armed poachers moved after virtually wiping
out the rhinos in eastern Africa, the government has given park
rangers authority to shoot to kill poachers. Cayford's cameras
capture the rangers' exhilaration after a violent confrontation. A
dead poacher is juxtaposed with grim eloquence against the carcass
of a rhino.
   Since 1985, more than 30 poachers have died. So have 330 rhinos.
The rangers say they don't like to kill humans to save animals, but
feel the decision is a moral one. The poachers are on the short end
of the economic stick. They risk their lives for a few hundred
dollars. The middlemen who smuggle the horns out of Africa make
thousands.
   Cayford says that despite their frightening appearance, rhinos
are peaceful beings. Nevertheless, the filmmakers are seen rapidly
retreating when one trots toward them.
   Cayford knows humans can't resist baby animals, even rhinos. One
baby who was savaged by lions is seen on a preserve for orphaned
and injured animals, trotting about with his loyal new friend, a
spritely sheep.
   ``He was sweet,'' said Cayford. ``I saw him a couple of months
ago, and he's doing fine.''
   For conservationists, it is an uphill battle to convince
Africans who are struggling to develop their countries that saving
wildlife should be a priority. Africans themselves are beginning to
take up the cause. Michael Werikhe of Kenya walks across his
country promoting wildlife conservation. ``It's time wildlife
awareness was taken to the people,'' he says. ``It's them who have
the final say.''
   ``There is concern, sure there's concern,'' Cayford said. ``It
just takes time. At the time people were wiping out the bison,
nobody cared very much.
   ``What you have to do is come to the country understanding the
country's problems, and helping rather than preaching,'' he said.
``You show them how wildlife has an economic value, that if you
look after wildlife by doing this, this and this, it's going to
bring you a natural benefit, that it's not something just to
preserve for its own sake, which is a nice idea, but it only works
when you can afford it.''
   At the conclusion of the film, the camera pans from a rhino
standing majestically on a ridge to the tall fence that he faces.
   If the rhino war is lost by the conservationists, the narration
says, ``the rhino will be doomed to exist in a child's picture book
of things that once were, but are no more.''

<HEAD>Activists Claim Human Rights Violations More Subtle in Chile</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Open violence against dissidents is now
rare in Chile, but specialists contend that widespread human rights
violations continue in more subtle ways and often are cloaked in
apparent legality.
   The 14-year-old military government of President Augusto
Pinochet, who also is the army commander, ``has modernized'' its
repression methods, claims Roberto Garreton, chief lawyer for the
Vicariate of Solidarity, the Roman Catholic Church's human rights
agency.
   Garreton and other lawyers and human rights activists contend
that the military regime has succeeded in politically neutralizing
many dissidents by fear, making violent repression no longer
necessary.
   Speaking in interviews, they said that although torture is still
common, the government has developed other, more subtle methods,
including the continued enforcement of a nationwide state of
emergency that empowers it to severely curtail basic civil rights.
   The government has also issued a number of specially tailored
decrees and laws that give a formal legality to repression and
ensure impunity to many human rights violators, the specialists
maintain.
   As an example, they cited the widenening scope of military
justice. During the last two years, 95 percent of those tried by
military courts were civilians, according to Alejandro Hales,
president of Chile's Bar Association.
   Hales said 90 percent of those tried were eventually freed
without charges, but most of them were kept incommunicado for long
periods, sometimes up to 40 days.
   The specialists contended that repression now often works
through indimidation and threat, including the action of several
shadowy, right-wing extremist groups that kidnap, beat up and
occasionally even kill people. Authorities deny any connection with
such groups and have promised to investigate.
   Nearly 200 Chileans claim to have received death threats in
recent months from the extremist groups, including some well known
dissidents, and many have been briefly kidnapped and physically
abused.
   One group, the September 11 Commando, took responsibility for
the killing of five leftists the day after a bloody but
unsuccsessful attempt to kill Pinochet in 1986. Five young
Communists have been missing since September, and a group called
Chilean Anti-Communist Action claimed responsibility Feb. 15 for
their abduction and disappearance.
   These methods ``have an extremely paralyzing and brutally
frightening effect on most people,'' said Garreton.
   Lawyers and human rights activists, including Hales and
Garreton, said they are convinced that those groups are
``centralized'' and connected to official security services.
   Jaime Troncoso, research director of the independent Chilean
Human Rights Commission, said ``threatening is the new tactic for
repression.''
   The critics point out that, although most cases remain unsolved,
every time a member of one of those groups was discovered, he
proved to be a member of the military or the security services. An
army lieutenant, Patricio Contreras, was killed three years ago by
a bomb he was planting at a church in the southern city of Punta
Arenas. A number of leaflets of the Chilean Anti-Communist Action
group were found at the site.
   Fernando Volio, a Costa Rican who is the United Nations'
officially designated human rights inspector for Chile, has
denounced the existence of the extremist groups. Unless they are
dismantled, he said, ``this society will remain torn apart.''
   In the years after Pinochet and the military seized power in a
bloody 1973 coup, hundreds of leftist dissidents were killed, and
at least 683 cases of political prisoners who disappeared have been
documented by local and foreign human rights groups. The torture of
prisoners was considered widespread.
   Summary executions have long since ceased and arbitrary arrests
have decreased sharply.
   According to figures gathered by the Chilean Human Rights
Commission, 33,903 people were arbitrarily arrested in 1986, while
the figure went down to 6,255 in 1987.
   The commission registered 106 cases of torture of dissidents in
1987, compared to 290 a year earlier.
   The commission's Troncoso stressed in an interview that ``we
have never had a single report proved unfounded. We are extremely
rigorous. There are many claims we do not publish for lack of
evidence.''
   Since the 1973 coup, the U.N. Human Rights Commission regularly
has issued reports that are highly critical of the Chilean
government. The U.S. State Department has also been critical of
Chile in its annual country-by-country report submitted to Congress.
   This year's reports by the U.N. and the State Department, while
still critical, noted an improvement in the general situation of
human rights here. But the U.S. report mentioned continued torture
of prisoners.
   The government rejected the reports. An official statement said
the U.S. report ``reflects only a partial picture of reality, ...
has errors and mentions some facts that have not been proved.''
   Carlos Varas, secretary of a government-appointed Human Rights
Commission, said the U.S. report shows ``a lack of knowledge of the
Chilean situation.''
   The government also complains that its critics fail to refer to
terrorism by leftist guerrilla groups when discussing the human
rights situation.
   Human rights activists criticize government legislation they
contend is tailored to curb dissent. They cite the 1980
Constitution, which outlaws ``totalitarian doctrines,'' such as
Marxism, and an amnesty law that they claim favors scores of human
rights violators.
   They also cite the nationwide state of emergency and widened
state of siege legislation that severely curtail civil rights and
grant authorities wide powers to supress dissent, including the
exile of dissidents, banning of public meetings, censorship of the
mail and communications and restrictions of freedom of the press
and of labor unions.

<TEXT>
   France's system of education, admired worldwide f, time-proven methods,
has become a source of concern
in French homes, where it is increasinglyor
its rigorous regarded as a misfit in
the modern world.
   To its critics of the late 1980s, it is like a fine old car on a
superhighway; it still works and still draws ``ahs'' but needs a
tune-up, or an overhaul, to keep up with the traffic.
   ``The fundamental problems with French education is that it is
an extremely selective system and leaves aside too large a
proportion of youth who don't finish their studies,'' said Olivier
Bertrand of the government-run Center for the Stuy 42 to 43 percent of
French students finish high school and
only about 22 to 23 percent go on to higher studies at a university
or a prestigious ``grande ecole,'' according to Bertrand.
   About 46 percent of French students receive what is known as
``professional formation'' for a specific trade, be it in a
hospital or a bakery.
   ``We are conscious these levels are no longer adapted to the
economic and social needs of today,'' said Bertrand. ``If you
compare it to countries like the United States or Japan, we are far
behind.''
   The Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, which seeks to promote economic and social development
in its 19 member countries, agrees with the system's critics.
   ``The education system is geared toward helping the academically
inclined. It is in fact a highly selective system which eliminates
the weaker pupils at each different level and tends to brand them
as losers,'' it said in a 1984 report on youth employment in France.
   The ``grandes ecoles'' perhaps represent the ultimate example of
selection in the education system. Since the 18th century, higher
education in France has been dominated by the elite, specialized
schools _ not universities _ which turn out the future leaders of
government and industry.
   One of the ``grandes ecoles'' is the Ecole Nationale
d'Administration, whose graduates have a near-monopoly on top jobs
in the government bureaucracy and figure prominently in politics.
   Another is L'Ecole Polytechnique, run by the Defense Ministry,
which turns out most of the nation's top engineers, many of whom
become chief executives in state-owned or private industries.
   Looking toward a more competitive continent when the European
Economic Community's open border policy starts in 1992, France is
scrutinizing its education system and finding it heading for, or
already in, a state of crisis.
   Students ill-prepared for the job market, a lack of funds, a
top-heavy structure and an aging, diminishing university teaching
corps are among other problems.
   A government-ordered report on university professors, released
Feb. 18, spoke of the ``vertiginous degradation'' of their lot, in
pay, lack of work incentives and mediocre working conditions.
   For the student, the lot is determined in a process of
selection, with the first at about age 13 based on performance in
French and mathematics.
   Universities present the opposite problem: any student with a
baccalaureate from high school can enter. There is almost universal
agreement that the 78 state-run universities need to be reformed,
but successive governments have faced a student broadside in trying
to do so.
   ``For the past 20 years, the university has been the sick man of
France,'' said the newsweekly Le Point in a cover story on
universities.
   While 80 percent of university graduates find jobs within 10
months of receiving diplomas, 70 percent of the jobs are either
administrative or not in the graduate's field.
   Even critics of the system say a student who passes the
baccalaureat, the several-days-long exam at the end of high school,
is better equipped academically than an American high school
graduate.
   But, according to current thinking, the student is not
necessarily better prepared to meet the requirements of the job
market.
   ``It is generally charged that national education is lagging
behind in comparison with the needs of companies,'' Bertrand said.
   ``In the universities, teaching is mainly theory,'' said a
24-year-old doctoral student, Laurence Guillochet. ``When you
leave, you have lots in your head but you don't know how to do
anything.''
   Premier Jacques Chirac, a presidential candidate in spring
elections, was confronted with the issue by an unemployed
24-year-old university graduate during a campaign stop in Reims.
   French education, the premier told the woman, has trained too
many people ``in abstract subjects for theoretical jobs.''
   ``It's too general. It does not give the technical expertise our
businesses demand. Our enterprises need more and more people with
technical knowledge.''
   Said Bertand: ``The big idea now is `alternance,' going
alternatively to school then a company for training, like in West
Germany, to get both theory and experience.''

<HEAD>Spirit of Japan's Secret Christians Lives On</HEAD>

   They worshipped in village homes at night.
They hid the symbols of their foreign faith inside Buddhist altars
and images. These were times when their discovery could mean
torture or death.
   They were Japanese who became Christians after St. Francis
Xavier visited Japan in 1549-1551.
   Today, Japan's Christians worship freely, but they cherish their
secret past.
   Some 13,000 of the nation's 1 million or so Christians continue
the tradition of secret worship, mostly on remote islands in
southern Japan. Most are the elderly who do so out of habit rather
than out of fear.
   And now artifacts of the secret-Christian era, many collected by
a woman who once worshipped secretly herself, soon will be
displayed in a museum here in Oiso.
   Hundreds of thousands of Japanese embraced Christianity under
Jesuit and Roman Catholic leadership in the 16th century, when
Western influence was first felt in their isolated archipelago.
   The government banned what it regarded as a disruptive foreign
religion after Europeans were expelled from Japan in 1639. In
periodic persecutions, suspected Christians were forced to recant,
or be tortured, crucified or burned at the stake.
   But Christians continued to worship privately for more than 200
years, and during that time, Japanese Christianity acquired a
unique flavor.
   The hundreds of statues and scrolls already collected by the
museum at Oiso attest to the ambiguity of religion in Japan, where
adherents to various faiths have customarily mixed Christian,
Buddhist and Shinto rituals to mark the major turning points in
their lives.
   As the Christians originally concentrated in Kyushu gradually
spread throughout Japan, they preserved symbols of their faith in
hidden ways, said Shigeru Tai, the curator of the museum's
collection.
   ``Carpenters built crosses into Buddhist temples,'' he said.
``They worshipped symbols of fish and family crests that were
shaped like crosses, and other Japanese didn't guess those were
also Christian symbols.
   ``In one temple, the walls were studded with cross-shaped
windows, but the (Buddhist) priests had no idea they were made by
Christians.''
   The secret Christians took advantage of this lack of awareness
and of the close similarity of the Christian Madonna and the
Buddhist god of mercy. They painted on their breasts tiny gold
crucifixes that apparently passed unnoticed.
   The back of one artifact, a statue of a Japanese warrior-god
brandishing a spear, opens to reveal an ivory and gold crucifix.
Other statues have false bottoms, with crosses and icons inside.
   Tai, 71, was a close friend of Miki Sawada, the woman who
collected the treasures and the granddaughter of the founder of the
Mitsubishi industrial empire.
   After her death in 1980, Tai and others raised the funds for the
museum, on the peaceful, forested grounds of the orphanage Mrs.
Sawada founded in Oiso, 35 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   Born into a strict Buddhist family, she learned of Christianity
from a nurse when she was 8 years old and worshipped secretly until
her 18th birthday, when she was allowed to attend a church service
for the first time.
   She eventually married a Christian and devoted her life and
wealth to helping others, establishing the Elizabeth Saunders Home
for orphans. The orphanage was named after an impoverished British
woman living in Japan who contributed her life savings, $170, to
help establish it.
   For 40 years, Mrs. Sawada visited communities where secret
Christians once lived, collecting their treasures, which are being
housed in a tiny chapel before the museum's opening in April.
   ``These items are priceless,'' said Tai, gingerly uncovering
what looks like a metal plate but turns out to be a magic mirror.
``There is only one man in Japan who can still make these mirrors.''
   Bright light reflected in the rather dull surface of the 16th
century mirror casts the shadow of Christ on the cross. To police
seeking out Christians at the time, the mirror was just a mirror,
but for the secret worshipers, it was a precious symbol of their
faith.
   The prohibition on Christianity, enforced sporadically, was
lifted when Japan reopened its door to the West in 1854. Under the
militaristic governments during World War II, however, Christianity
again became suspect.
   Some secret Christians willingly worshipped both Buddhist and
Christian deity. Others, forced to demonstrate their piety at
temples and shrines, directed their prayers toward crosses etched
secretly by other Christians into woodwork or hidden behind
Buddhist altars.
   When Japanese pray at shrines and temples, they usually clap
twice. The Christians would clap once again, the third clap a
reminder of the Holy Trinity, Tai said.
   ``During the war, when Christianity was considered subversive,
we used to clap the third clap very quietly,'' he said.
   Christianity, however, has set down few roots in this syncretic
nation, and today attracts less than 1 percent of Japan's 121
million people.
   Less than half the Japanese people profess devotion to any
faith, but Japanese life is still dominated by Buddhist and Shinto
rites, and most homes have Buddhist altars for prayers to dead
family members.
   The Christians still living in remote villages in southern
Japan, who say prayers in an incomprehensible form of pidgin
Japanese, are continuing a tradition that is dying elsewhere, Tai
said.

   Today is Monday, Feb. 29, the 60th day of 1988. There are 306
days left in the year. Today is Leap Day.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On Feb. 29, 1940, the motion picture ``Gone with the Wind'' won
eight Oscars at the Academy Awards ceremony in Los Angeles. The
honors included best picture of 1939, best director (Victor
Fleming), best actress (Vivien Leigh) and best supporting actress
(Hattie McDaniel, the first black performer so honored).
   On this date:
   In 1736, Ann Lee, founder of the Shaker movement in America, was
born in Manchester, England.
   In 1792, composer Gioacchino Antonio Rossini was born in Pesaro,
Italy.
   In 1796, President George Washington proclaimed Jay's Treaty,
which settled some outstanding differences with Great Britain, to
be in effect.
   In 1896, movie director William W. Wellman was born in
Brookline, Mass.
   In 1904, bandleader Jimmy Dorsey was born in Shenandoah, Penn.
   In 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed a seven-member
commission to facilitate completion of the Panama Canal.

   You can't look at David J. Colmans' book, but you
can read it.
   The book _ on using computers in public relations and related
fields _ was written on computer by people contacted via computer,
edited on computer and published on computer.
   And since it exists only in the memory of a computer in
Columbus, Ohio, the book can only be read by using a computer.
   ``The essence of the book is to share information on the `this
is how I do it' use of technology in the communications arts,''
said Colmans, vice president of an Atlanta public relations firm.
   Colmans is one of about six ``system operators'' of a computer
network called the Public Relations Special Interest Group. Along
with co-editor Ron Solberg of Chicago, he has compiled the book
over about four years.
   In it are chapters written by the public information officer for
Kansas City, Mo., who tells how he has set up a computer network to
tell citizens what is happening in the city; discussions of ``voice
mail,'' a sophisticated, computer-operated telephone answering and
message system; and numerous other aspects of how to use technology
in the field.
   The computer book, which would be about an inch thick if
printed, is better than one on paper, Colmans said, because ``once
you buy a hardcopy book and put it on the shelf, that's it for
eternity _ whatever's in the book is the information.''
   ``With an on-line book, not only are you not stuck with having
to have all the information sitting on your shelf, ... but the
minute something becomes obsolete, bang, it's gone. And the minute
something comes in that's interesting and new, in a matter of a
couple minutes it's on line and available for everybody to see,''
he said.
   The book _ with the official title of ``The Functional Use of
Computers in Public Relations, Marketing and Advertising'' _ is a
true creature of electronics.
   ``Virtually the entire book was brought together through
electronic mail messages and sharing of text as opposed to voice
communication,'' Colmans said.
   ``There were very few phone calls. ... The book itself was
created in an electronic communications environment. I have met,
face to face, about six of the 40 to 50 people that I communicate
with electronically. Most of them are just type on a screen to
me,'' he said.
   Colmans is not your average computer hacker, sitting in front of
a terminal, wrapped up in the nuts and bolts, or bits and bytes, of
technology.
   ``About five years ago, I started getting interested in
computers to help me do my work, not just to play with, because I'm
one of those people that can't write a program,'' he said.
   ``I don't know how a computer works any more than I know how a
television set works. But I do know how to turn on a TV and I do
know how to turn on a computer.''
   In compiling the book, Colmans said, ``the big issue that we
discovered was, and still is today, that there are so many kinds of
computers out on the market and there's a real lack of
understanding among computer users that ... you can actually get
those computers to talk to each other.''
   Because the book has not been published in the traditional
sense, Colmans earns nothing from the people who use it.
   ``We have not done this project to make money; we've done this
project to share information,'' he said, although there has been
some discussion about publishing a ``hardcopy of the book'' in the
future.

<HEAD>South African Mixed-Race Leader Makes a Comeback</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allan Hendrickse, a mixed-race
politician and member of President P. W. Botha's Cabinet, defied
apartheid laws more than a year ago and went swimming at a
whites-only beach. Then at Botha's demand, he apologized.
   Doubts immediately arose that the highly regarded Hendrickse
would ever regain credibility among his non-white constituents.
   But he has made a remarkable comeback.
   Hendrickse now is recognized as perhaps the only elected
official in South Africa with both the will and the power to defy
the president.
   As leader of Parliament's mixed-race chamber, he is in a
position to force Botha's National Party to the polls next year,
three years earlier than it would like.
   Botha he needs consent from all three chambers of Parliament to
delay the election from 1989 to 1992. Hendrickse, whose Labor Party
holds 76 of 85 seats in the House of Representatives, says he won't
acquiesce unless Botha abandons the government's policy of
segregated neighborhoods.
   This demand is unlikely to be met and has resulted in
Hendrickse's forced resignation from the Cabinet. But the
confrontation appears to have boosted his popularity among the
country's 3 million ``coloreds,'' as mixed-race South Africans are
called.
   ``Suddenly a lot of people who were disinterested or
antagonistic are now realizing that you can find yourself in a
position of altering the course of history in this country,''
Hendrickse, 60, said at a recent news briefing. ``It does give you
and the people you represent a feeling of importance.''
   Hendrickse's political fortunes have seesawed since he helped
found the Labor Party in 1969.
   He was detained for two months in 1976 for his anti-apartheid
stance, but came under fire from activists in 1984 when the Labor
Party agreed to participate in a new tricameral Parliament setup.
Chambers for Asians and coloreds were created to join the dominant
white chamber, although the nation's black majority remained
excluded.
   The Asian and mixed-race chambers are allowed to handle their
``own affairs'' _ deciding to how to allocate public funding for
their own communities, for example. But the 1984 constitution gives
the majority party in the white chamber almost total power to set
national policy and to override even combined opposition from the
other chambers.
   Hendrickse said he would cooperate with the new system for five
years in an effort to dismantle apartheid from within. Activists
nonetheless denounced him as a sellout for joining Botha's Cabinet
as minister without portfolio.
   ``Our participation within the system must not be construed as
an acceptance of the system,'' said Hendrickse. ``We walk the
difficult road of being in and yet being out.''
   In January 1987, the portly politician made a seemingly bold
challenge of the government by wading into the surf at a
whites-only beach in Port Elizabeth.
   Botha, in a televised speech, furiously ordered Hendrickse to
apologize or quit the Cabinet. Hendrickse apologized.
   ``It was a demolition job with such humiliation for Rev.
Hendrickse that he is unlikely to recover from it,'' Peter Gastrow,
chairman of the white opposition Progressive Federal Party, said at
the time.
   Now, white liberals applaud Hendrickse's tougher tactics and are
considering possible alliances with his Labor Party.
   Hendrickse still has many detractors, including activists who
totally reject the tricameral Parliament. At the University of the
Western Cape, a leftist, predominantly mixed-race school, Rector
Jakes Gerwel said Hendrickse's resurgence had been ``a non-event.''
   The pro-government media also has been critical, for different
reasons. The Citizen, a Johannesburg newspaper, maintained that the
Labor Party had become ``fractious and militant'' after being set
on a ``dangerous collision course'' by Hendricske.
   Hendrickse says he holds no personal animosity toward Botha but
is clearly pleased at having found an effective means of
challenging him.
   ``It's not a question of personal power or strength, but rather
a recognition of the correctness of the decision to participate (in
Parliament),'' he said. ``In spite of the constitutional
inadequacies, we were able to find a gap, a weakness, and thus find
ourselves in a powerful position.''
   In addition to his leverage over the election schedule,
Hendrickse has blocked a government proposal to begin joint debates
among the three parliamentary chambers. Without joint voting and
other reforms, the change is meaningless, Hendrickse maintains.
   Regardless of whether the white election is delayed, Hendrickse
wants mixed-race elections to proceed as scheduled next year. Only
30 percent of colored voters went to the polls in 1984, when
activists urged a boycott, and Hendrickse says the turnout next
year could rise to 50 percent.
   He said pro-government forces are seeking to weaken him by
dividing his party. Allegations have surfaced that National Party
officials tried to bribe Labor Party members into deserting him.
   There is speculation that Botha may retire soon, and Hendrickse
has raised an intriguing scenario regarding the choice of a
successor by the electoral college.
   The college consists of 50 National Party members, 25 Labor
Party members, and 13 members from the Asian chamber's majority
party. Hendrickse says the Asian and mixed-race electors could
thwart the selection of a hardliner if they could persuade seven or
more relatively liberal Nationalists to join them in electing a
moderate, such as Foreign Minister Roelof ``Pik'' Botha, no
relation to the president.
   Hendrickse was raised in Uitenhage, near Port Elizabeth, the
fifth child of a Congregational minister. He grew up in an
integrated neighborhood and became a minister himself.
   In 1971, the mixed-race community was forced to move to a
colored township under terms of the Group Areas Act, which mandates
segregated neighborhoods. Hendrickse has described his father's
anguish as he watched their home and church being destroyed.
   Now, he wants the National Party to abolish the Group Areas Act
and says he has done enough compromising.

political hues are in the race for Venezuela's presidency, but
polls give two centrists the leading edge so far in the campaign
for December's balloting.
   A former anti-government guerrilla hopes to become a serious
third option, but the other 11 candidates are given little chance.
   One of the centrists is Eduardo Fernandez, who is known as ``The
Tiger.'' The other is Carlos Andres Perez, a former president who
has been matching practically every every campaign promise
Fernandez has made.
   The former guerrilla is Teodoro Petkoff, a Socialist.
   Fernandez and Perez represent the two political parties that
have dominated Venezuelan politics since dictator Marcos Perez
Jimenez was overthrown in 1958 after six years in power.
   Accion Democratica (AD), the social democratic party now in
power, is fielding Perez, a 69-year-old charismatic leader with
considerable political experience.
   Perez's government in 1973-77 is popularly associated with the
oil-prices boom in 1974.
   He is considered to have a slight edge now for the Dec. 4
election, although the 47-year-old Fernandez, the Copei or
Christian democratic party candidate, has made inroads by raising
the issue of electoral reform.
   After a shaky start, Fernandez took the initiative with calls
for direct elections of state governors, rather than by
presidential appointment, and voting for individual congressional
candidates, rather than by party lists.
   ``I don't think there is an electoral system in the entire world
as primitive as ours,'' Fernandez told reporters recently.
   According to a recent Gaither poll done for Perez's AD, the
promise of reform enabled Fernandez to narrow the distance between
him and Perez to 11 percent by late January, from around 30 percent
in November.
   Following Fernandez's electoral-reforms proposal, Perez came up
with one of his own.
   ``I propose to the nation a Pact for Reform, to deepen and open
our democratic system,'' Perez announced at a public celebration
Jan. 23 marking the 30th anniversary of the Perez Jimenez's
overthrow.
   The 10-point Pact for Reform contains proposals almost identical
to the Fernandez's.
   ``The only thing (Perez) has to do now is support my
candidacy,'' Fernandez complained at a recent rally.
   The two major parties have staked out electoral bases so broad
that voters are sometimes hard pressed to see a difference.
   Fernandez and Perez preach political reforms of the democratic
system, but they agree it should stay democratic.
   They argue about the degree of state intervention in the
economy, but they agree the state should intervene.
   Copei, a member of the Christian Democratic Organization of
America, is considered somewhat more conservative, while AD, which
belongs to the Socialist International, is more labor-oriented.
   But they are both centrist. Their members run from conservative
to liberal, but most are somewhere in between.
   Venezuela's presidency has flipped back and forth between the AD
and Copei five times in the six elections from 1958 to 1983. An AD
candidate succeeded an AD president only once.
   Their success in dominating Venezuelan politics has relegated
all the other parties to marginal political roles.
   The ex-guerrilla Petkoff is carrying the banner of the
Movimiento al Socialismo.
   In the 1960s, when an indigenous guerrilla movement was active,
Petkoff preached a socialism bordering on communism.
   But he gave up his fight, accepting amnesty offered by the
government. He moderated his views and is now a member of Congress.
His party dropped its affiliation with Moscow following the
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslavakia in 1968.
   But even though Petkoff started his campaign by trimming his
bushy moustache and longish hair in an effort to dispel any
conceptions of radicalism, he isn't expected to win much more than
5 percent of the vote.
   That was as much as his party got into 1978, its best year.
   The remaining candidates are even worse off. They are formally
in the race but are not making much of a difference.
   Venezuela's first woman presidential candidate, Ismenia
Villalba, is running on the slogan, ``Ismenia, take her into your
heart.''

<TEXT>
   India is taking the bullock-cart into
the 21st century.
   At least 500 researchers in about a dozen government-aided
institutes are at work modernizing the ancient, creaking, plodding
carts, and even the World Bank has donated funds. Carts of various
shapes and designs, made of plastic and aluminum, are being tested
or have been developed.
   ``There is nothing funny about our project,'' said Mittar Pal
Dhir, director of the Road Research Institute in New Delhi. ``For
us, animal-drawn carts are of great importance.''
   India has an estimated 13 million bullock carts drawn by about
26 million of the neutered bulls, along with 2 million carts pulled
by water buffaloes, camels, horses, mules and donkeys.
   The carts are seen most often in villages, where about 640
million of the India's 800 million people live.
   But they also are seen on major highways and an estimated 3
million plod along city streets, often slowing engine-powered
traffic and infuriating motorists.
   Bullock carts have even been used to pull MiG fighter jets to
parades and earth satellites to launching pads.
   Dhir said it would be 50 years before India could eliminate
animal-drawn carts, given their crucial role in Indian life.
   Capital investment in animal-drawn carts is put at $7.6 billion.
   More than 20 million Indians earn their living by driving,
renting, and repairing the carts.
   ``The figure is striking given the fact that Indian railways,
the fourth largest in the world, employ only 16.3 million people,''
said Rupinder Gupta, a mechanical engineer for the Road Research
Institute. Gupta has designed six types of bullock cart for field
trials.
   Each year, animal-drawn carts move 14.4 million ton-miles of
freight.
   Dhir estimates that India's animal-drawn carts provide about 40
million horse-power, equal to about 320,000 medium-duty trucks used
in the United States as city delivery vehicles.
   Without bullock carts, India also would have had to import an
additional 6 million tons of fuel each year. It now imports 17
million tons of crude oil annually.
   One of the innovations is the replacement of the carts'
wooden-spoke wheels with pneumatic tires.
   Engineer Gupta said carts with pneumatic tires can pull 2.5 tons
of weight against the maximum capacity of 1.5 tons for conventional
carts.
   Researchers in the southern state of Karnataka also have come up
with plastic bullock carts, and in neighboring Andhra Pradesh state
a tire company has produced carts of lightweight aluminum.
   Another idea behind non-wooden carts is to reduce demand for
lumber. An estimated 165,000 medium-sized trees are felled each
year to make conventional carts.
   ``So you see, there is a solid logic behind metal carts,'' said
Gupta.
   He listed other reasons for updating the carts.
   ``We want to increase tillage and output, reduce damage to roads
and injury to animals so that the poor animals can have a longer
lifespan,'' he said.
   To protect the animals, curved and padded yokes are being
introduced. Studies have shown that some draft animals' lives are
cut short by cancerous infections on the neck from unpadded and
uncurved yokes.
   Reflectors are being added as another safety feature.
   Other new fittings are bush bearings, cast-iron springs, shock
absorbers, draw bars that adjust for animals of different height,
and mud scrappers.
   A fodder box can be put on carts that go long distances.
   As for road damage, director Dhir said the biggest culprit is
wooden wheels.
   ``In monetary terms the annual damage is to the tune of 7,000
million rupees ($538 million) to the roads,'' he said.
   Farmers seem to like the idea of improving bullock carts.
   ``It is an excellent idea,'' said Jhandu Singh, 64, of Jharsa, a
village 30 miles south of New Delhi.
   ``But this should have had been done 25 years ago. We have
suffered for long, and so did the animals.''
   Officials, too, say the new carts are catching on, but this
itself is creating problems.
   ``We do not have enough new types of carts for all,'' said Kalle
Khan, project economist of the District Rural Development Agency in
Jharsa, whose office received only 16 new carts.
   ``There are more than 200 claimants. Even some gypsies saw the
carts and were attracted. They wanted at least one. I told them no.
These are for farmers.''
   Another reason for high demand is that the government is
subsidizing the price by about 35 percent.
   It is estimated that the largest of the old wooden carts costs
the equivalent of about $300. Newer wooden carts, without the
government subsidy, cost $270 to $460. The plastic and aluminum
carts are 25 percent more expensive.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The former mayor of Syracuse, N.Y., will be
sentenced this week on charges that he extorted hundreds of
thousands of dollars from people wanting to do business with the
city. Lee Alexander, a Democrat, pleaded guilty to the charges,
saying he accepted sole responsibility for what happened.

<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In his day, Lee Alexander was one of the
most visible mayors in America, a politician who seemed destined
for bigger things.
   Now he appears destined for prison.
   As mayor of New York's fifth-largest city, Alexander had a
penchant for beautiful women, chauffeur-driven limos and
bodyguards. He was a snappy dresser with a deep tan, his hair
always in place.
   During his 16 years as mayor, Alexander, a Democrat, was often
the spokesman for the nation's mayors. He served as president of
the U.S. Conference of Mayors and six times was elected president
of the National Conference of Democratic Mayors.
   There was talk of a big job in Washington, speculation that he
might some day run for governor. Party leaders made him their
candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1974, but he lost the primary to
former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark.
   Now it turns out the man who looked so urbane and polished was
actually an extortionist, using his power to coerce money from
people wanting to do business with the city of Syracuse.
   Alexander's scheme preyed on architects, lawyers, engineers, and
insurance agents. They paid him up to 25 percent of the cost of the
project and payments were made in bonds, gold coins and cash.
   For example, an architect paid Alexander $125,000 for the
opportunity to work on a project at the city's Hancock
International Airport and another paid $25,500 for a hospital
parking garage expansion. An insurance agent paid an Alexander
bagman $26,200 for a fire policy and a lawyer paid a bagman $2,878
to handle the legal work on a downtown building project.
   ``A lot of people turned down the deals and nothing happened,''
said U.S. Attorney Frederick J. Scullin. ``Alexander was astute
enough to know where he could put the pressure. If someone caved
in, well, he kept the pressure on. If someone rebuffed him right
away, he'd back right up.''
   By the time Alexander left city hall in 1986, he was a
millionaire.
   Now he has to pay it all back.
   Alexander pleaded guilty to charges that he violated federal
racketeering laws by using his power as mayor to extort money, that
he conspired to obstruct the investigation and that he evaded
income taxes on his illegal profits.
   Sentencing is scheduled for March 10.
   The federal prosecutor is recommending that Alexander be
sentenced to 10 years in prison and fined $100,000. Scullin said he
believes that a 10-year sentence would be longer than any handed to
a public corruption figure in the nation.
   Alexander could have faced 690 years in prison if convicted on
all 40 counts of the original indictment.
   The former mayor has also agreed to return $1.2 million of his
illegal profits. Alexander has said the settlement will leave him
in worse financial shape than he was in 1970 when he began his
mayoral career.
   Some of Alexander's bounty was turned over to prosecutors by
attorneys delivering shopping bags filled with valuable bonds and
coupons. Some of the money was banked overseas in such places as
the Bahamas and Panama, according to Scullin.
   Nine other people who have pleaded guilty to charges stemming
from the investigation will be sentenced along with Alexander.
   Alexander's undoing started with Scullin's appointment as U.S.
attorney for northern New York in 1982. Scullin, who grew up in
Syracuse and earned his law degree from Syracuse University, said
he had heard talk that Alexander was crooked.
   ``This thing really began when I first became U.S. attorney,''
Scullin says. ``There were rumors on the street then about
Alexander being a wheeler and a dealer. If not kickbacks, then
there was talk about a lot of conflicts. The rumors were pretty
rampant. I decided we should look into it and put them to rest one
way or another.''
   At first, it was slow going. But the investigation persisted.
   ``You keep working and working, nibbling away at it, developing
whatever information you can,'' Scullin says. ``There was a pattern
of no-bid contracts and professional fees.
   ``We got a couple of breaks. We got lucky.''
   The Internal Revenue Service and the FBI joined Scullin's
attorneys in the investigation. A witness came forward offering
information in exchange for immunity. ``That was the crack in the
dam,'' Scullin says.
   At its peak, Alexander was the focus of attention of a team of
prosecutors, 20 FBI agents and another 20 IRS agents.
   What they came up with was enough evidence to persuade a grand
jury to indict the mayor.
   Alexander always seemed on the verge of becoming a political
heavyweight.

   In 1976, he passed up an opportunity to be an early supporter of
Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign to serve as upstate campaign
coordinator for the ill-fated campaign of Henry Jackson.
   His extortion scheme was designed to increase his influence with
national politicians, according to Scullin.
   ``He wanted to be considered a viable influence on the
Democratic Party and make things happen,'' Scullin said. ``He could
get the money where other people could not.''
   Many of the kickbacks Alexander arranged were made in the form
of political contributions to big-time Democrats, Scullin said. New
York City Mayor Ed Koch, Gov. Mario Cuomo and Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis were among the recipients.
   ``Toward the end he sort of lost track of the political
contributions,'' Scullins said. ``As he could see his star
dwindling the last three or four years, I think he was more
concerned about lining his own pockets. He got greedier and
greedier as time went on.''
   Opponents were critical of Alexander's frequent trips away from
Syracuse, saying he was more interested in traveling than tending
to local problems. Alexander defended his travels, saying he came
back with federal money for his city.
   Alexander found an opportunity to get some publicity one day
when a gunman killed a man, then took a pregnant woman and her baby
hostage in a predominantly black neighborhood, holding police off
for most of the day.
   After being held back by police for many hours, news
photographers were suddenly allowed to approach the house. The door
opened and Alexander ran out of the house clutching the baby to his
chest. Photographs of the mayor carrying the baby to safety were
displayed by newspapers across the country the next day. Black
leaders complained that it was the only time Alexander had ever
visited the neighborhood.
   On the local level, Alexander was a skillful and effective
politician. Until Alexander came along, the Republicans dominated
Syracuse and Onondaga County politics. Alexander's campaign not
only ended a 16-year Republican rule of the mayor's office, but led
the Democrats to control of the common council.
   Not everyone liked Alexander. When shots were fired at his
house, police were prompted to build a guardhouse outside the home.
   City Auditor Roy Bernardi was probably Alexander's most vocal
critic. Bernardi's complaints were aimed mainly at the way the
mayor did business.
   The auditor said he knew then that the city was paying too much
money for projects and was always doing business with the same
people.
   ``I noticed a pattern that if not illegal, and I had no proof of
that, it was not in the best interest of the city,'' said Bernardi,
who is still the city auditor.
   Ironically, while Alexander was in power, his Republican
opponents who controlled surrounding Onondaga County were the
target of a special prosecutor investigating political corruption.
Despite the talk on the street, the special prosecutor didn't pay
much attention to the Democrats.
   The special prosecutor was appointed by then-Gov. Hugh Carey, a
Democrat, to investigate allegations that Republicans illegally
coerced political contributions from public workers. The
investigation netted convictions against several key Republicans
who claimed they were unfairly singled out for activities common in
politics and also practiced by City Hall Democrats.
   But the crimes of the Republicans pale when compared with what
was going on in Alexander's city hall office.
   The Republicans were convicted of violations of a state law
prohibiting political fund-raising in public buildings and
misdemeanors. Juries returned acquittals on the more serious
charges. No Republicans went to prison and no Democrats were ever
indicted in that special investigation.
   Alexander is not talking publicly about his troubles, his lawyer
said. After making his guilty plea, Alexander issued a statement
saying the city never paid for any services it did not receive.
   ``I accept sole responsibility for what happened,'' Alexander
said in his statement. ``While pursuing the highest standards of
integrity with respect to the conduct of members of my
administration, I did not apply those same standards to myself.''
   Tom Young, a Democrat, is the mayor now, and he runs things
differently. Instead of personally selecting who does business with
the city, Young has contractors submit competitive bids. Young has
a panel study the proposals before a contract is awarded.
   There are many who still believe Alexander was good for Syracuse.
   ``I never saw any sign of any wrongdoing,'' says Robert Visser,
the city clerk who has worked in city hall since 1974.
   ``He did an awful lot of good for the city and eventually the
good will outweigh the bad. If it had not been for the former
mayor, the city of Syracuse would not be in the great shape it is
in today.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ She was accustomed to the privileged life of an
European princess, the daughter of King Ferdinand and Queen Marie
of Romania and great-granddaughter of England's Queen Victoria and
Czar Alexander II of Russia. Today Princess Ileana leads the
disciplined life of a cloistered nun as the Rev. Mother Alexandra.

<TEXT>
   Her family jewels are gone and her
castle is property of the communist state, but Romania's Princess
Ileana has found peace at a monastery in rural western Pennsylvania.
   The 79-year-old princess is now known as the Rev. Mother
Alexandra, one of 12 nuns who share food, work and prayer at the
Romanian Orthodox monastery.
   The nun of 27 years was the founder of the Orthodox Monastery of
the Transfiguration, the first English-speaking Orthodox monastery
in the United States.
   But vestiges of her royal past remain, even at the monastery.
   Portraits of her parents, Romania's King Ferdinand and Queen
Marie, hang in the living room of the A-frame house she shares with
another nun.
   Gold and silver icons dating as far back as the 15th century
fill a corner of her bedroom, including one handed down in the
family from Czar Nicholas I of Russia and said to contain a
splinter of Christ's cross. Antique icons also decorate the
monastery's small, candle-lit chapel, as do crosses and triptychs,
some of which she brought from Europe.
   A small, gold container on a bed stand holds her most precious
possession, a handful of Romanian soil snatched during her escape
from Soviet communism in the wake of World War II. She wants it
buried with her.
   ``There's a big gap between then and now,'' she says. ``So much
has happened in between.''
   Uncomfortable sitting with idle hands, the tall, stately nun
worked on a knotted prayer rope as she reflected on her
multifaceted life.
   ``It's been different so many times over,'' she says. ``But, you
see, one lives day by day, doesn't one?''
   She refuses to compare her royal and religious ways of life.
   ``There is no point,'' she said. ``I did my duty as a princess.
And now I'm doing my duty as a nun.''
   Her superiors, nonetheless, are impressed by her example.
   ``As a person, as an individual, I have admiration because even
not having a position, she could have had a social life, which
would be much more in keeping with other people of her
background,'' said Bishop Nathaniel Popp, 47, head of the Romanian
Orthodox Episcopate of America.
   ``Instead of saying she was a princess who became a nun, I think
it was more she was a nun coming through the life of a princess.''
   Although just a child during the German invasion of World War I,
Princess Ileana accompanied her mother, the queen, from hospital to
hospital, administering to Romania's wounded and hungry. By the
time World War II erupted, both her parents were dead, her older
brother, Carol, had ascended the throne, one sister had become
queen of Yugoslavia and another queen of Greece.
   Princess Ileana was living in a castle outside Vienna, wife of
an archduke of Austria and the mother of six.
   Afraid of the Nazi regime, Princess Ileana and her family moved
in 1944 to Romania. There she set up hospitals and did what she
could for her suffering compatriots.
   In December 1947, the king of Romania was forced by the
communists to abdicate and the following week, Princess Ileana and
the rest of the royal family were exiled.
   Princess Ileana immigrated with her family to Switzerland and
then Argentina before settling in 1950 in the United States, a move
that ultimately led to divorce. To support her children, she sold
her cherished diamond and sapphire tiara, lectured about life
behind the Iron Curtain, and wrote an autobiography titled, ``I
Live Again.''
   It wasn't until 1961, after her children were grown, that the
52-year-old princess became a postulant. She ended a second
marriage to do so.
   ``In my heart,'' she says, ``I always wanted to become a nun.
But there was so much to be done in Romania when I was young.''
   Princess Ileana took the monastic vows of stability, obedience,
poverty and chastity in 1967 and, with that profession, became
Mother Alexandra. Later that year, she put up a trailer on 100
acres of farmland outside Ellwood City and began building an
English-speaking monastery for Orthodox women of all ethnic
backgrounds.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The Society of Automotive Engineers was founded
shortly after the turn of the century as a clearinghouse for a free
exchange of ideas at a time when inventors were making contraptions
that suited their own tastes. Just as it set the standards for the
production of automobiles, SAE now is proposing interchangeable
parts for spaceships.

<TEXT>
   An organization of engineers, best known
by its initials on motor oil cans, hopes to do for spaceships what
it did for automobiles and airplanes.
   The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), founded in 1905, is a
global engineering network for the exchange of ideas. Members have
included Henry Ford, Orville Wright, Harvey Firestone, Thomas
Edison and Charles Lindbergh.
   SAE writes standards on such things as what grade of motor oil
works best in cold temperatures, how much reflection comes from a
taillight lens, the process that makes a brake stop a car.
   More than 900 standards cover every passenger car.
   These standards make sure a product performs in a generally
expected way. They are guideposts by which government and industry
have measured performance for 83 years in self-propelled vehicles.
   ``We serve the public by getting the technology out so that
others can build upon it and use it as a steppingstone without
having to reinvent the wheel,'' says Max E. Rumbaugh Jr., executive
vice president of SAE.
   SAE now has its eyes on the stars.
   It created a space standardization advisory committee, which met
for the first time in December, for possible standards on
spaceships. SAE hopes to work with the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration on guidelines that would reduce confusion,
eliminate duplication and cut costs.
   ``The space program has been so unique, we've been experimenting
with technology that is one of a kind,'' says Arshad Hafeez, SAE's
aerospace engineer.
   Six of the 25 members on SAE's exploratory committee are from
NASA, which wants to have a space station in orbit in the next
decade so it can assemble ships in space, among other things.
   ``It's getting to the point where some standardization will help
everybody,'' says Dick Weinstein, manager of engineering standards
and practices for NASA.
   ``There's enough on the horizon that if we don't do something
soon, we could be in big trouble. Everybody will be going in a
different direction.''
   Rumbaugh adds: ``As they start putting things up there like a
space station, you've got to have interchangeability of parts for
repair and maintenance.
   ``You can't be coming back down here when a light bulb goes out
and build a new one to take back up. Standards allow you to reduce
the cost of manufacturing. Making one of a kind costs you a
fortune.''
   SAE has its world headquarters in a three-story, red brick
building about 30 miles north of Pittsburgh near the Pennsylvania
Turnpike and Interstate 79.
   With 52,000 members in 82 countries, it has 25,000 technical
papers on file, holds 20 meetings a year, publishes two magazines
and has an engineering library.
   None of the volumes will make a best-seller list, but they
titillate engineers.
   Esoteric titles include: The Internal Combustion Engine In
Theory And Practice, volumes one and two; Fuel Alternatives For
Spark Ignition And Diesel Engines; Reinforced Thermosetting
Plastics For Ground Vehicle Applications; The Toyota Production
Method; and Human Tolerance To Impact Conditions As Related To
Motor Vehicle Design.
   Some car manuals are available in Spanish, French and German.
   Anyone who pours a can of motor oil can notice the letters SAE
along with numbers corresponding to the viscosity of the oil. SAE
standards cover 11 grades of oil, with lower numbers performing
better in lower temperatures.
   Oil companies voluntarily produce and label their products by
SAE standards.
   Other SAE deeds are less visible.
   ``A lot of the work is sort of boring,'' Rumbaugh says. ``We
don't have a lot of hoopla. SAE just attempts to get the job done.
Oftentimes, a job can get done a heck of a lot better before it
gets a lot of media exposure. We prefer to do things before getting
the hype.''
   SAE was fringhouse for a free exchange of ideas
at a time when inventors were making contraptions that suited their
own tastes.
   Each car still has unique style features. But SAE standards
cover such things as ounded as a cleahow much light is emitted by headlamps,
the
shade of red in a taillight, the area of the windshield that should
be cleared by a wiper and the size of the lug nuts that hold a rim
onto a wheel.
   SAE also helped develop the closed-in auto body, the
self-starter that replaced the hand crank, the hydraulic brake, the
synchronized transmissions that eliminated gear noises and led to
the automatic transmission, shatterproof glass, power steering and
power brakes.
   ``The American automobile industry has thrived on the principle
that the exchange of technical information improves society,''
Rumbaugh says. `` They are less secretive than almost any other
industry in the world.''
   William Sherman, writing in 1980 on The journalists also met with a
member of what Bleibtreu said
was the Contra human rights commission.

<HEAD>Mayor Invites Reporter Back for Second Look</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Mayor Palmer DePaulis has invited a reporter to
take a second look at the city the newsman described in print as a
``Perry Como kind of place'' where the Mormon Church dominates
daily life.
   DePaulis says he doesn't want to appear defensive but sent a
letter to the Los Angeles Times inviting David Lamb to return for a
second look.
   In his letter Feb. 17, DePaulis said Lamb's story overlooked the
city's rich cultural climate and ethnic diversity, as well as its
beautiful mountain scenery.
   ``I wish he could see the 10th St. Patrick's Day Parade, whose
grand marshal this year is consul general of Ireland, or the
Italian-American Columbus Day celebration, ongoing since 1934, or
our annual Greek Festival and Hispanic Fiesta,'' DePaulis wrote.
   The mayor said he might try to find a sponsor for Lamb if the
invitation is accepted.

<HEAD>Lawrenceville Paper Moves to Mornings</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. _ The Gwinnett Daily News will convert to
morning publication in early May, the newspaper announced in its
Feb. 21 editions.
   It currently publishes in the afternoon five days a week and in
the morning on Saturday and Sunday.
   Executive Editor Jim Osteen said, ``moving to morning
publication will allow us to produce a more expansive, complete
newspaper for our readers. It will also allow our coverage of
sports and the stock market report to be more timely.''
   The Gwinnett Daily News, purchased in June by The New York
Times, becomes the second suburban Atlanta newspaper to switch from
afternoon to morning publication. The Marietta Daily Journal
announced similar plans earlier this year.
   In the last 10 years more than 100 afternoon newspapers across
the country have switched to morning publication.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ A Boston television reporter took to the streets
a few years ago and asked dozens of passersby to describe the
current sky without looking up. Only one in 10 could do so. That
inspired him to design a sky-watching program for schoolchildren
called ``For Spacious Skies'' that is getting rave reviews from
many educators.

<TEXT>
   It was a blustery New England morning, with a
cutting wind blowing off Boston Harbor. People were staying inside
if they could, but Pat Keohane and her first-graders were up on the
school roof again, looking at the pale winter sky.
   ``What's moving the clouds?'' she asks, pointing at a bank of
cumuli.
   ``The wind,'' reply the kids in an enthusiastic chorus.
   ``There's light blue, and dark blue and baby blue over there,''
says a little girl, her scarf flapping as she stared intently at
the heavens.
   The boy next to her interrupted: ``There's a swordfish with a
long nose.'' His comments were suddenly lost in a babble of other
kids' voices.
   ``Look, those clouds look like a sweat suit,'' said one.
   ``I see an upside-down dragon,'' another giggled.
   Back at their desks later, the children took turns spelling
sky-related words in a variation of the classic hangman game, doing
well on big ones like ``lightning,'' and ``showers.''
   A diminutive boy spelled ``rain,'' and Ms. Keohane asked: ``What
would happen if we didn't have rain for 100 days?''
   ``There would be no flowers and no wildlife,'' one of the pupils
piped up.
   ``That wouldn't matter,'' said another. ``We'd still have water
in the sinks.''
   In Ms. Keohane's inner-city classroom at the Josiah Quincy
School and at about 1,400 others across the country, teachers say
that a program called ``For Spacious Skies'' is helping pupils
academically and emotionally.
   Some of those involved with the program go even further,
suggesting that sky watching can turn tough inner-city kids away
from drugs and desperation and on to aesthetic beauty instead.
   Jack Borden, originator of the program, says, ``Wherever you are
you have the sky, whether you are living in the high mountains or
the worst of slums. As a matter of fact, the person living in the
worst slums often has access to the most sky.''
   A study conducted by researchers at Harvard University's
Graduate School of Education appears to support some of the
positive claims made by teachers enthused about sky watching.
   Using two classrooms at an elementary school in Needham, a
community about 15 miles west of Boston, the study compared pupils
who participated in ``For Spacious Skies'' in the fall of 1985 and
again at the end of the school year, with those who were not
encouraged to look at the sky.
   The researchers found that the emphasis on looking up, followed
by drawing pictures and writing about the sky, ``significantly
increased the level of aesthetic sensitivity in visual art and
literature.''
   ``The benefits gained from a program such as this would have a
great value in any school curriculum,'' the study said.
   The program encourages children to keep journals on their
observations and some of them write poetry and draw pictures, said
researcher Liz Rosenblatt. ``The fact that kids are exposed to the
arts in this way helps create an awareness that probably helps the
increase in their skills.''
   ``For Spacious Skies'' is named after the familiar first line of
the Katherine Lee Bates poem, set to music by Samuel A. Ward as
``America the Beautiful.''
   Borden, a quixotic former television reporter, believes that we
cannot spend life looking at our feet. His vision came to him about
10 years ago, while working at Boston's WBZ-TV.
   Taking to the street, he asked dozens of passersby to describe
the current sky without looking up. Only one in 10 could do so.

   ``I myself was a non-aware person,'' Borden says. ``Then I began
to see that it's a good thing to turn people on to the sky.''
   Since that summer day in 1977, Borden, 59 , has formed a
non-profit company to distribute ``For Spacious Skies'' teaching
kits, which offer suggestions on how to use the heavens to teach
just about anything.
   ```For Spacious Skies' is designed to help teach mathematics,
English, creative writing, music, art and science,'' according to
the preface of a booklet meant for schools in the New England area.
``This program, just like the New England sky, is limitless. With
the sky as a catalyst, your student's imagination can be challenged
to its limits.''
   The kits, which are mailed to schools for about $7.50, include
guides for teachers on presenting the material. They contain tables
of wind-chill factors, relative humidity and barometric pressure,
songs about the sky, and sample observation sheets for students to
note weather conditions.
   Donna Cataldo, a support specialist at Josiah Quincy, outlined
the different uses of the program at her 830-pupil school:
   ``Some of the upper classes are keeping charts about the length
of the day and how that relates to the harvest and growing cycles,
and that brings out social studies...what are some of the origins
of feast days and festivals that are based on the length of the
days and the growing season.
   ``At lower grades, kids can do bar graphs of how many sunny days
there were in January and how many snowy days there
were...measuring and counting and a number of interdisciplinary
skills. It allows children to write. They might also do a science
project around wind speed.''
   Gov. Michael Dukakis proclaimed last March 18 ``For Spacious
Skies Day'' in Massachusetts.
   The American Meteorological Society honored the program for its
work in public education a year ago and scheduled presentations on
``For Spacious Skies'' at its annual meeting this year at Anaheim,
Calif.
   Weather forecasters are Borden's key allies in getting the word
to teachers about sky watching. Many have mentioned the program
during their broadcasts, and some have gone even further,
incorporating aspects of ``For Spacious Skies'' in weather lectures
and seminars for children and teachers.
   Meteorologist Bruce Schwoegler of Boston's WBC-TV said he was
amazed at the interest in ``For Spacious Skies'' booklets offered
on the air to teachers.
   ``I ran a three-part series in our news last March in which we
offered 3,500 teachers' guides...and we had a very enthusiastic
response,'' he said. ``They were all gone within a month.''
   In Pittsburgh, weatherman Brian Sussman of KDKA-TV said his
station's booklet giveaway had similar success.
   Discussing the program's value in tougher inner-city schools,
Sussman drew parallels between sports and sky watching.
   ``Just like athletics has been a vehicle to get kids out of the
ghetto, I'm looking at `For Spacious Skies' as a vehicle for
sparking interest in a particular field like geography,'' he said.
``What I'm seeing is kids who are interested in something else than
MTV. They, for the first time, are observing the beauty of nature.''
   Violet Witherspoon, a disciple of sky watching who teaches the
third-grade at the John Marshall Elementary School in Boston's
Dorchester section, expressed similar sentiments.
   ``I told the children, `You don't need drugs, let the sky be
your drug,''' she said.
   ``They can look at the sky and daydream. They don't have to have
fine clothes, they don't have to have fine cars, beauty is all
around them, and it's free.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Born in a Virginia hill town, Seka got
interested in the porn business through her boyfriend who owned
adult bookstores. Today she's a legend in the adult-film industry,
as a performer and as an astute businesswoman.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A porn queen who found her way to the other side
of the camera is ascending toward the top in a $1 billion-a-year
business where many women work but precious few call the shots.
   She's a platinum blonde whose stage name is Seka. At 33, she has
appeared in more than three dozen hard-core adult films over the
past decade.
   ``She is still legendary,'' said Paul Fishbein, publisher of
Adult Video News magazine. ``When today's generation delves into
the adult-film market for the first time, she is still the one they
want to see.''
   But the big reason for Seka's financial success is that she sued
her manager under federal corruption laws and gained control of her
name, her films and a business that turns annual profits in six
figures.
   Dressed demurely in a sweater and slacks and tucked into the
corner of a dark restaurant, Seka looks every bit the businesswoman
she is as chief executive officer of the Chicago-based Pearl
Productions Ltd., which sells everything from lighters with her
logo to panties.
   ``Nobody has ever taken care of me,'' Seka says
matter-of-factly, running a bright pink fingernail through her
close-cropped, platinum hair. ``And as long as I look after
business, nobody ever will.''
   Seka (she will not disclose her given name) was born in the
Virginia hill town of Radford, where the main industry was an
arsenal that manufactures dynamite.
   She married a factory worker before she finished high school,
but the marriage didn't last long.
   ``All I knew was I wanted to be on my own. I wanted to be
independent,'' she recalled. ``I didn't want to wake up and have
someone next to me saying, `Fix me coffee and breakfast.'''
   Her introduction to the porn industry came during the mid-1970s
through a boyfriend who owned adult bookstores. The more she became
involved in the trade, the more she became convinced, ``I could do
it better.''
   She worked her way back from the distributors she knew through
the bookstore business to the moviemakers themselves, went to
California one bright day in 1977, answered an ad for a nude model,
and started working that afternoon.
   Seka was paid $200 for her first movie, a 15-minute, 8mm film.
   Many of her early films _ she made more than two dozen between
1977 and 1979 _ were only slightly more memorable, although the pay
scale improved considerably.
   She was, however, just another 23-year-old ingenue making adult
films, indistinguishable from dozens of other young women in the de
rigeur black nylons and garter belts of the times. Then she met a
makeup man with big plans. It was 1980 and the home-video market
was just beginning to heat up.
   He made her over, bulked her up with weights and vitamins,
changed the way she dressed, and managed her business in the
bargain. Her new look debuted in 1981 in Club magazine and the
result was booming sales.
   Yet, after what should have been a very profitable rise to the
top of her profession, Seka had to hire an attorney simply to look
at her own books. One glimpse and she sued her manager for
diverting income.
   She worked sparingly over the next two years, ultimately finding
herself in 1984 with a handsome settlement and control of a
potentially lucrative business now that the home-video market was
changing the rules of the adult-film game.
   No longer dependent on recovering most of the costs from
theaters, adult film-making became an almost risk-free venture.
   A handful of pornographers had recognized the home-video
market's untapped potential ahead of the major movie studios and
already were doing land-office business.
   A movie that could be made for as little as $150,000 if shot on
film _ or $20,000 if shot directly onto videotape _ becomes a
profit-maker after only moderate sales and rentals.
   That meant an adult film had only to sell about 20,000
videocassettes _ an average wholesale cost of $25 per cassette _ to
qualify as a megahit. By comparison, a major movie studio needs to
sell 50,000 units to approach the same status.
   And Seka needed only one look to realize that under the new
economic reality, age and overexposure were threatening her main
asset _ her body.
   So in 1984 she added a copyright attorney to gain control of her
old material, then a contract attorney to make certain she got top
dollar for whatever new material she released.
   She has made just two feature films since then _ only one has
been released _ studied diction and elocution and devoted most of
her time to mastering business skills: computers, flow charts,
marketing and the like.
   Her return to the adult-film industry as an actress came in a
big way with the 1986 film, ``Careful, He May Be Watching.'' The
movie, which cost about $230,000 to make, stars Seka in a dual role
as twins, one evil, one not.
   She also conceived the story line, developed the script and
served as producer. Former porn star actor Richard Pacheco
directed, making the film something of a trailblazing effort from
start to finish.
   ``Careful'' won the Adult Video News awards for best picture and
best director, capped off by Seka's induction into the Hall of
Fame. But she says ``Careful'' won't begin making money until it's
been on the market for about 2{ years.
   ``I can wait,'' she said. ``I've got some projects, an exclusive
magazine deal, things I can't talk about in the wings. I've even
been offered the opportunity to be in a major motion picture, but
there were casting couches behind the screen.
   ``At least what I do,'' Seka concluded, ``is on the screen.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Janwillem van de Wetering wrote his first book
at age 40 after years of hopping around the globe and pursuing an
interest in Zen Buddhism. The Dutch-born author, who now lives in
Maine, was interviewed in New York where he was visiting his
publisher.

   Fans of offbeat mysteries set in exotic locales
dote on Dutch author Janwillem van de Wetering, a former Amsterdam
cop who spent two years in a Zen Buddhist monastery in Japan.
   But even though his novels often have a Zen flavor, van de
Wetering says the three heroes of what his publisher calls ``the
Amsterdam cop series'' are not followers of the Oriental philosophy.
   ``They've never heard of Buddhism or Zen,'' says van de
Wetering, who now makes his home in Maine, drawn there first by a
Zen teacher. ``I mention it sometimes, in a joking manner, because
it's popular with the Dutch intelligentsia. The police couldn't
care less. They think it's all long-haired nonsense.''
   Yet, their supercool investigations read like they're following
the Zen practice of attaining enlightenment by intuitive insight,
beyond intellectual reasoning.
   ``A lot of people do that,'' van de Wetering says. ``If you
can't figure it out, then don't try to figure it out but stay with
it.''
   Van de Wetering, now 56, wrote his first book when he was 40. It
was ``The Empty Mirror,'' about his experiences in the Zen
monastery.
   He has written three childrens books, two novels, two books
about Zen, a biography of Dutch diplomat-author Robert van Gulik
and is best known for 12 mysteries, most set in Amsterdam.
   The first mystery van de Wetering wrote, ``Outsider in
Amsterdam,'' introduced the wonderfully detached Commissaris, a
Dutch municipal police officer, and his underlings in the murder
brigade, Adjutant Grijpstra and Sgt. De Gier.
   ``Originally I wanted to write a realistic book about the
police,'' Van de Wetering said during a visit to New York to visit
his publisher. ``I had been a policeman myself and thought I could
do it. It never came off, even at first. None of the characters
wanted to do that.
   ``Grijpstra was going to be the nasty guy. He immediately became
sympathetic. He is my Dutchman, my everyman, my superego. He is not
into fantasy. I intended him to be pretty dumb but he isn't.
   ``De Gier turned out to have tremendous energy that everybody
has as a child and then it gets repressed and organized by society.
With De Gier it never got organized. He is not in the police for
any good purpose; he's an adventurer. He's tremendously curious; he
wants to see what goes on. He doesn't necessarily sympathize with
goodness and frown on evilness.
   ``The only one who's got it all together is the Commissaris. He
looks like a gray mouse, with his limp, but he really is a
combination of them and goes beyond both of them. He is what I
think a Zen master ought to be like. The Commissaris is convinced
it doesn't matter what you do but he will always do the nice
thing.''
   Two of van de Wetering's mysteries have been made into movies in
Holland. Contracts for an American movie have been signed for
``Hard Rain,'' published in 1986 by Pantheon. Ballantine has
published all the mysteries and the two books about Zen in
paperback.
   The author, whose name is pronounced yan-villum van de
vet-tevin, started visiting a Zen teacher on the coast of Maine in
the 1960s. In 1975, he and his Colombian wife, Juanita, settled
nearby. He became disillusioned with the Zen teacher but stayed in
Maine because he likes the country. His wife took up gardening.
Their daughter is married.
   ``We live on 60 acres, which is quite normal there,'' he says.
``I see my neighbors when I go look for them. But too many artists
hang out in that part of the world. We meet each other in endless
encounters that consume too much time. I really have to discipline
myself when I go to the post office not to lose all day.
   ``The weather is so interesting. We all have boats. There's a
big colony of seals and we talk about what they do and what bird is
coming for the summer or leaving for the winter.
   ``I have very little discipline. If I don't want to work, I peer
at the window and hope the dog will come in. When I want to work,
I'll work through the night and the next day won't go to the post
office.''
   Van de Wetering's hobby is making junk sculpture, which he
displays around his property.
   ``I was always frantic about finding certain parts. An old man
said, `Just let it come to you.' I do that all the time now. When I
turned 50, I was worried about dying. I wanted a vehicle to guide
me across _ a horse. The afternoon I thought of it, I went to the
beach and found legs and ribs, a sheet of plywood that was a
wonderful fit and rope for the tail.''
   Van de Wetering learned about the Amsterdam police work during
seven years in the reserve police, working mostly nights and
weekends.
   ``I had to do it because I got accused of dodging the draft. I
left Holland when I was 19 and never remembered to come back. It
was kind of a punishment. I liked it. After four years I could have
quit.''
   At 19, van de Wetering went to South Africa to work, then to
England to study philosophy for a year.
   Dissatisfied with Western philosophy, he spent two years in a
Zen monastery in Kyoto, Japan. After that he worked for a chemical
company in Colombia, in real estate in Australia, returned to
Amsterdam to take over his uncle's wholesale textile business. He
got bored with that, sold it after seven years and moved to Maine.
   He started to write during the seven years in Amsterdam.
   ``I always wanted to write,'' he says. ``I couldn't. I did bits
and pieces and articles. I read that Henry Miller started when he
was 40. I kept the desire alive. I started writing when I was 40.''

   Mario Van Peebles, making his first real
venture into television, is amazed that producers and network
executives are listening to his suggestions and putting them on the
screen.
   Van Peebles stars in the NBC comedy-adventure series ``Sonny
Spoon'' as an unorthodox detective who is part con man, part actor,
and regularly slips into other characterizations to get the job
done.
   Last year, he appeared in about six episodes of NBC's ``L.A.
Law'' and won the NAACP Image Award as best supporting actor for
his role in ``Heartbreak Ridge.''
   Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment, called him in
for a meeting and asked him to do a series. Producer Stephen J.
Cannell saw a short film he did and wanted to work with him. So
Tartikoff, Cannell and Van Peebles went to work on the idea of
``Sonny Spoon.''
   Van Peebles suggested some scenes for the show. ``One is that I
hide out in a Baptist church dressed up as a big lady in the
choir,'' he says. ``Then the choral director points to me and I
have to sing a solo. They used my suggestion.
   ``In another show, a friend of mine steals some jewels from a
mobster, not knowing he's a mobster. When he finds out, I dress up
like a priest and return the jewels.
   ``Sonny's like a chameleon. He can plug into any character. In
the episode we're doing now I go undercover as a white yuppie. I
have blue eyes and blond hair.
   ``It's exciting for me as an actor. You get to play so many
different roles. I can cross age lines, sex lines, race lines.''
   During his lunch break in his trailer, which is parked in the
Veterans Cemetery in Westwood near the campus of UCLA, he eats a
quick lunch brought to him by his mother. Later, the company moves
to Wilshire Boulevard.
   On arrival at the new location, Van Peebles points to a
banged-up yellow Porche Carbriolet. ``They wanted to give me a new
Porche,'' he says. ``I said no, Sonny would drive a car with dents
in it.''
   Until about two years ago, Van Peebles was working mostly in the
theater as an actor, writer and director. He grew up in show
business as the son of director-actor Melvin Van Peebles.
   A short film he wrote, directed and played in, ``Juliet,''
attracted some attention. ``It's about a girl who goes through a
bunch of guys,'' he says. ``I played all the guys. Cannell saw that
and wrote some of those characterizations into `Sonny Spoon.'
   Van Peebles says that both Tartikoff and Cannell encouraged his
suggestions about the show.
   ``To tell the truth, I wasn't sure anything would come out of
it,'' he says. ``That's why I was so bold in speaking up. For
instance, I said I didn't want my character to carry a gun. I
called him a `finagling humanitarian.' It's like when Bugs Bunny
comes up against the Tasmanian Devil. He has to get out of that
situation on his wits alone.
   ``That makes it a little tougher to write. It's easy to write
that a character gets out of a car and pulls a gun. It's much
harder to have him suddenly become a Hispanic taxi driver.''
   Van Peebles got a degree in economics at Columbia University and
went to work as a budget analyst for the city of New York.
   ``I figured if I could do Mayor (Edward) Koch's budget I could
do a movie budget,'' he says. ``I thought it was time to get back
into acting and thought dad would help out. I took him to his
favorite Chinese restaurant. I said, `I've got my degree, are you
going to help me out?'
   ``He said, `No.' He said the restaurant was full of people who
were waiting for a break. It was up to me to go out and make my own
breaks. But mom and dad were very supportive. They came to see me
in every little play I did. Now I meet some kids of famous people
who can't do anything on their own.''
   Van Peebles likens his interest in acting, writing, directing
and producing to working on a farm.
   ``On a farm you don't just do one thing,'' he says. ``You plow a
field, fix the tractor, feed the chickens, patch up the barn roof.
In other words, you do everything. That's the way I grew up in the
business.''

   Alan Ayckbourn may be known as Britain's most
prolific comic playwright, but the man often billed as an English
Neil Simon says his plays are getting darker.
   In his 32nd play, ``Woman in Mind,'' now at off-Broadway's
Manhattan Theater Club, the author presents a heroine on the brink
of madness. Audiences may laugh at first, Ayckbourn says, but he
hopes the chuckles ultimately catch in the throat.
   ``It's an attempt to be a popular play saying something
serious,'' the 48-year-old Ayckbourn said the other day in an
office at London's National Theater where he has been in residence
as a director and a playwright since the fall of 1986.
   ``I stopped calling my plays comedies years and years ago,''
says the London-born writer who began his career as an actor and
stage manager.
   ``People write and say, `Woman in Mind' is rather sad at the
end, isn't it?' and I say, `Well, yeah. I only said it was a play,
not a comedy.'''
   A rotund, engaging man with a low laugh that sometimes swallows
up his words, Ayckbourn has made his reputation over two decades by
chronicling the humors and the horrors of the British lower middle
class.
   While such colleagues as Harold Pinter and Tom Stoppard spin
elegantly phrased dramas out of the mores of the well-heeled,
Ayckbourn's terrain is the same middle class that makes up his
audience. They are the people he courts and, sometimes, critiques.
   ``I take the audience by the hand and take them down a path they
would not normally have gone,'' Ayckbourn says.
   That audience has remained loyal over two decades, since his
1963 play ``Mr. Whatnot,'' about a mute piano tuner, brought him
acclaim and an agent, the influential Margaret Ramsey.
   According to a 1985-86 British Arts Council report, Ayckbourn's
plays were second that year only to Shakespeare's in numbers of
performances given throughout England's regional theaters.
   His work is performed in more than 35 countries as far afield as
Uruguay, Australia, and Kenya. Although several have been seen on
Broadway _ most recently ``Bedroom Farce'' in 1978 _ he has not yet
enjoyed a Broadway smash.
   ``Broadway is the toughest nut to crack, of course, in the whole
world,'' Ayckbourn said, conceding he was preoccupied with the New
York reception of ``Woman in Mind.''
   ``I don't know how they'll take it,'' he said of the play, which
casts Stockard Channing _ 1985's Tony-winning star of ``Joe Egg'' _
as a middle-class Englishwoman named Susan who seeks refuge from
her dreary domestic routine in a fantasy world rife with its own
dangers.
   ``I wanted to get inside somebody else's head, really inside it,
and see if I could bring the audience with me,'' Ayckbourn says.
``I also wanted to say, `This is what it must be like to have your
powers of mental perception slipping away from you.'''
   ``In Susan's case,'' he continues, ``you suddenly realize she's
unreliable _not deliberately, but that her perceptions of what is
real and what is not are completely false. She begins to get
reality and dream muddled.''
   ``Woman in Mind,'' which had a successful West End production
starring Julia McKenzie, is just one recent Ayckbourn play that
looks at the moral and psychological underside of people and their
society.
   In ``A Small Family Business,'' currently at the National
Theater, Ayckbourn weaves a tale of ethical decay in which the
upstanding hero, Jack McCracken, gets sucked into corruption both
at home and at work.
   ``Henceforward,'' which played Houston's Alley Theater last fall
with George Segal and which opens on the West End with Ian McKellen
in November, dramatizes a futuristic British society dominated by
thugs, hoodlums, and people who have become robots.
   It's a far cry from the Ayckbourn of ``Absurd Person Singular''
and ``The Norman Conquests,'' two hits from the mid-1970s which
showed London and Broadway the playwright's clockwork precision
with a laugh.
   Does the author sometimes feel that his earlier works were
written by a different person?
   ``It's like looking at an old snapshot and saying, `I don't
remember looking like that,''' he said. ``I no longer really
remember why I wrote them. I've just moved on.''
   He said he's no longer as concerned with craft per se as he once
was.
   ``When I started, it was like a kid discovering he's got 10
fingers. It's great to use them all, and I use them quite a lot,''
said Ayckbourn, whose works often feature multiple endings _ some
decided by coin tosses _ and Chinese box-like plays-within-plays.
   ``Once you've done a few of those bravado tricks and shown
yourself you can do it, the technique I hope sinks a little bit.''
   More recently, Ayckbourn has had great success as a director.
His production of Arthur Miller's ``A View From the Bridge,''
starring Michael Gambon as Eddie Carbone, ended its acclaimed
yearlong run on Feb. 20.
   He also directed John Ford's 1630 verse drama, ``'Tis Pity She's
a Whore,'' at the National's Olivier Auditorium. Rupert Graves, who
appeared as the gamekeeper Scudder in the film ``Maurice,'' stars
as the incestuous Giovanni.
   Now it's back up north to the Yorkshire city of Scarborough, a
resort and conference town where Ayckbourn is the artistic director
of the Stephen Joseph Theater-in-the-Round. There, he will open his
35th play, ``Love of My Life.''
   And what's that like?
   He chuckles: ``It's a bit lighter.''

<HEAD>BRUSSELS: from Europe.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Then came a series of jolts, starting with a summit meeting in
October 1986 between Gorbachev and Reagan in which the leaders came
close to agreeing on the elimination of all ballistic nuclear
missiles. This stunned West Europeans, who felt the Americans had
not adequately consulted them on such a proposal, which they
strongly opposed.
   From that point, it was increasingly clear that major reductions
in nuclear arms were likely. The first step was taken this past
Dec. 8 when Reagan and Gorbachev signed the treaty eliminating
land-based intermediate-range nuclear missiles, representing about
4 percent of their arsenals.
   With the INF treaty, as it is called, expected to win U.S.
Senate approval within a few months, and the superpowers already
agreed in principle to 50 percent cuts in their long-range, or
strategic, nuclear arms, NATO finds itself facing tough choices
about adjusting its military posture.
   One of the most difficult and immediate choices is whether and
how to modernize the U.S.-controlled nuclear weapons that will
remain in Europe after the American cruise and Pershing 2 rockets
are withdrawn.
   The gist of the debate is that most NATO governments, including
the United States, say this upgrading is vitally important, while
most factions in West Germany's coalition government strongly
oppose it.
   Lord Carrington of Britain, the NATO secretary general, says the
alliance must ignore Soviet warnings that an upgrading of the
nuclear arms would inflame the arms race and violate the spirit of
East-West disarmament efforts.
   ``If you don't modernize, eventually you don't have any nuclear
weapons, which they (the Soviets) would like,'' Carrington said in
an interview.
   The West Germans have clear reasons for disliking the more than
2,000 NATO nuclear weapons that are candidates for modernization:
most of them, including artillery, bombs and land-based missiles,
are in West Germany; if fired the likelihood is that many would
strike only in East or West Germany. While their nation is divided,
Germans still regard themselves historically as one people.
   The West German government in Bonn wants NATO to open
negotiations with the Soviets on reducing short-range nuclear arms
_ those with ranges of less than 500 kilometers (310 miles) and not
covered by the U.S.-Soviet treaty. The United States, France,
Britain and other alliance members fear this would play into the
hands of Gorbachev, who has said repeatedly that his aim is to rid
Europe of all nuclear weapons.
   Some European analysts worry that it eventually could be the
undoing of NATO itself.
   ``The reopening of the nuclear issue in Germany has the
potential ultimately to break up the alliance,'' Pierre Lellouche,
deputy director of the Institut Francais des Relations
Internationales, wrote in a recent newspaper column.
   From the U.S. viewpoint, improvement of nuclear weapons
remaining in Europe is directly linked to the question of whether
some of the American troops in Europe, mostly in West Germany, may
be pulled out.
   The Reagan administration has said repeatedly that it opposes
any troop withdrawals. Yet U.S. Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci
said recently that if Europe lost its short-range nuclear arms _
either through negotiation or obsolesence _ a troop pullout might
be considered.
   America's allies have gotten the message.
   ``Under whatever administration comes next in the United States,
there will be more pressure for reducing the American commitment in
Europe,'' said De Hoop Scheffer, the Dutch ambassador to NATO.
   Said another NATO ambassador, speaking privately: ``There is a
feeling here that despite the best intentions of the current
administration, it's only a matter of time before the U.S. troop
levels are reduced.''
   Manfred Woerner, the West German defense minister who is due to
succeed Carrington as NATO's top political officer this summer, was
quoted as saying in a recent newspaper interview that he saw ``a
certain evolution'' in U.S. thinking that raises some questions
about how long the West Europeans can count on the United States to
keep its troops on the continent.
   ``That's why our European role (in NATO) must reflect our own
interests,'' he said.

<HEAD>Family-Run Cafe Shows Limits and Prospects of Soviet Reforms</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A few months ago, Olga Osipov had a good income
from a prestigious job teaching Chinese. Now she and her family run
a Chinese restaurant and they are $25,000 in debt.
   But they saw it as an opportunity opened up to them by
General-Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reforms.
   ``Perestroika,'' the name given Gorbachev's modernization
program, has changed the lives of people like Mrs. Osipov and her
family and promises to touch millions more as the drive for a more
efficient Soviet economy gathers steam.
   The small Chinese restaurant run by Mrs. Osipov and her family
is their own, with each member owning a share and getting a share
of the profits. It is officially recognized as a cooperative.
   The Meikhua also is a model of what Soviet authorities had in
mind when they loosened laws last year to permit cooperatives and
individual labor, such as moonlighting, giving Soviet citizens an
official touch of private enterprise.
   Opened Nov. 17, the Meikhua cafe is the only known family-run
Chinese restaurant in the whole of the Soviet Union, which shares a
3,000-mile border with China.
   Operating a cooperative gets around a major theoretical hurdle,
because anyone who does not work for himself or for the state is
thought to be exploited by an employer.
   But the Meikhua cafe and other cooperatives face difficulties in
offering alternatives to the state-run economy.
   Meals in the cooperatives are more expensive than in the
multitude of state-run restaurants. Ingredients are hard to come by
and consumer resistance is high because cooperatives' prices
fluctuate with the market and availability.
   Among the co-ops that have sprung up under the new law are
establishments that produce plastic beach shoes and children's
jackets sewn from scraps in Armenia. Others harvest fish, pick wild
berries and repair apartments in the Siberian city of Kurgan.
   Moscow has a cooperative extermination service and a cooperative
that refers callers to other cooperatives. About 70 co-op
restaurants have opened in Moscow, which has a population of nearly
9 million.
   Gorbachev told writers and editors in mid-January that 13,000
co-ops had been established and more than 300,000 people were
working for themselves within the narrow confines of new
regulations intended to encourage better supply, goods and services
that in the state-run economy are notoriously slow and of poor
quality.
   ``This is not particularly many for a country like ours, but
nevertheless a step forward has been made,'' he said.
   Each new venture must be approved, granted a location and
outfitted by local authorities and the state-run enterprises
against whom the cooperative competes. Those who want to start a
cooperative or work for themselves often report discouraging
bureaucracy and heavy licensing fees.
   But Mrs. Osipov, taking a break one recent morning from chopping
vegetables and meat in the Meikhua's kitchen, said the bureaucrats
moved quickly in her case because Moscow had no cooperative serving
Chinese food.
   That is one indication officials are more interested in
providing a little variety than in fostering competition.
   Mrs. Osipov's son, Volodya, 27, a teacher of English and
Chinese, was washing floors and cleaning tables on his day off from
teaching.
   ``I come at 9 o'clock in the morning and don't leave until 11
o'clock at night,'' Mrs. Osipov said. ``And my son, he's teaching
at school from 8 a.m. until 2 p.m. Then when he's done at school,
he comes here by 3 o'clock.''
   ``We work a lot,'' she said. ``Honestly, it's hard.''
   Main dishes at the Meikhua can cost from 2.90 rubles (about
$4.75) for a pork and cabbage dish to 8 rubles ($13.25) for braised
sea slugs, a specialty. The sea slugs must be marinated for several
days and take several hours to prepare, Mrs. Osipov said.
   A five-ounce serving of rice costs 30 kopeks (50 cents). A few
more kopeks brings a pot of jasmine tea.
   Service at the restaurant's nine tables was quick and friendly,
and everything on the menu was available. At state-run restaurants,
it often is easier to ask the waiter which of the dishes on the
menu actually are available, and service is notoriously slow.
   Mrs. Osipov was born in northeast China of a Russian mother and
Chinese father. She and her husband cook home-style food from her
native region.
   Volodya, and another son, a daughter and son-in-law do everthing
else. All but the 49-year-old Mrs. Osipov kept their old jobs or
remained at their studies.
   The family would like to hire an extra cook and keep the cafe
open longer than five hours a day, six days a week. But their
intent to keep it essentially a family-run business fits well
within the limited scope of the law.
   Asked if he would prefer to teach or run the cafe, Volodya said:
``I would like, if it was possible, to be more creative as a
teacher, to work there. But it has been very interesting here so
far. To create something is always interesting. Here it's possible
to govern yourself fully.''
   The family needed 15,000 rubles ($25,000) to get started, and
friends advanced some of the money to help them turn a former
two-family apartment building into a restaurant. A bank lent more
money at 3 percent interest, and government organization provided
the kitchen equipment and furniture.
   The cafe's income is about 500 rubles (about $825) a night,
roughly half of which goes for food, heat and electricity. Family
members are paid about 250 rubles ($413) each a month, some 50
rubles ($82.50) more than the typical Soviet factory worker.
   Because prices in cooperative restaurants are higher than in
state-run restaurants, some Soviets grumble that the cooperatives
are too expensive for the average citizen.
   In a recent article, the Communist Party newspaper Pravda
printed several letters from readers complaining about prices at
cooperatives.
   One letter writer, I. Cherkashin of Moscow, said cooperatives
had not forced prices down by providing more competition but had
driven them up.
   ``Who is it that makes the laws on prices _ the market,
cooperatives, or the government?'' he asked.
   Cooperatives get the bulk of their food from farmers markets,
where prices are unregulated and run substantially higher than
state markets and stores. Supply, while still uncertain, is usually
better in the farmers markets, particularly for fresh fruits and
vegetables rarely found in Moscow during the long winter.
   ``We'd like to have a constant supply ... so we don't have to
depend on the market,'' Volodya said. ``If they are selling meat
one day for seven rubles a kilogram and the next day for 12 rubles,
our prices jump.''
   To get the spices she needs for Chinese cuisine, Mrs. Osipov
travels occasionally to Kirghizia, a republic of Soviet Central
Asia bordering China. But some spices, she said, cost a ruble
($1.65) a spoonful, adding more to the prices on her menu.

<TEXT>
   If an award is given for silliest movie of the year, ``A Tiger's
Tale'' is likely to have few serious competitors. It's not
offensive, not insulting _ just plain silly.
   And it's too bad because a lot of the ingredients in this
romantic comedy had potential for something better. Ingredient No.
1 is Ann-Margret, an actress with so much skill and innate dignity
that she almost saves the film. But not quite.
   She is cast as Rose Butts, the divorced mother of a wild
teen-age daughter in a nondescript Texas town. Rose works as a
nurse by day but spends her nights nursing lonely drunks.
   Into her bored, sad life comes her daughter's castoff teen-age
boyfriend, Bubber, who becomes smitten with the mother and won't
take no for an answer.
   Thus begins an unlikely May-December romance between the naive
19-year-old boy and the middle-aged mom. But once the two begin to
cuddle, no one seems to know what to do next, least of all
scriptwriter Peter Douglas, who also directs.
   He diverts our attention to a few subplots. There's Bubber's
dilemma over whether to give up his pet tiger, Valentino (the most
enchanting performer in this flick). And there's Bubber's widowed
father's dilemma over whether to marry again. The father, a retired
veterinarian who keeps snakes around the house, is portrayed by
Charles Durning, another gifted actor whose efforts are wasted here.
   Finally, a crisis is created to bring Rose and Bubber back in
focus. It turns out that her daughter, Shirley, enraged by Mom's
unconventional affair, has had her revenge. When she left to live
with her father, she poked a hole in Rose's birth control device.
Can you guess the result?
   The rest of the plot is so preposterous you have to laugh.
   It should be mentioned that a major flaw from the outset is the
lack of even the smallest spark of chemistry between Ann-Margret
and her teen-aged lover, C. Thomas Howell, a gangly, wholesome kid
with a Texas accent who would seem more likely to fall in love with
a horse.
   ``A Tiger's Tale'' is rated R for sexual subject matter.

   Hollywood has never been able to get a fix on
Tony Bill, and that seems to be just the way he likes it.
   He graduates from the University of Notre Dame in 1963 and steps
into a star-making role as Frank Sinatra's brother in ``Come Blow
Your Horn.'' Just as his acting career is rolling, he turns
filmmaker and co-produces ``The Sting,'' which won an Academy Award
as best picture of 1973.
   Next he becomes a director, specializing in such unpretentious
films as ``My Bodyguard.'' He even established his own little
studio, not in the mainstream but in the ragtag beachfront subur   Bill

comedy-drama about life in the Bronx in the 1960b
of Venice.
s. The only
recognizable name in the cast is Jody Foster. It is the first
screenplay written by John Patrick Shanley, who has received an
Oscar nomination for the script of ``Moonstruck.''
   ``I'm a nut for originality,'' Bill said in an interview. ``I
like original screenplays _ ones that are not from books or plays
or short stories. I like scripts that are not like another movie
I've seen. They are special, unique, personal, human. They're not
about cars or robots f in ``Five Corners''?
   ``I always said I'd never cast myself in one of my own pictures.
I have fun now and then acting in other people's productions. I can
always think of somebody better than myself when it comes to
casting something.''
   As an independent filmmaker, Bill has experienced many rough
periods _ ``lots of them, and there will be many more. Lots of
debts. Lots of risks. Lots of bets that I've lost, as well as bets
I've won.
   ``It's the life of a professional gambler; that's what
filmmakers are,'' he said. ``You put your money where your mouth
is. You try to play the hand as well as it can be played. You think
you've made a good movie, and it's a disaster. You think you've bet
on a longshot, and it's a winner. It's the life of a poker player.''

<TEXT>
   Concert pianist Eugene Istomin has loaded his
Steinway on a van and is driving from town to town for his 1988
tour _ an unusual way for classical musicians to hit the road.
   ``It hasn't been done this way for 50 years at least,'' Istomin
says. ``Paderewski (the Polish pianist and composer who died in
1941) had a private railroad car.
   ``There are a lot of places on my tour where so-called `big
name' artists don't go. The seating capacity of halls is small and
people can't afford to pay very high fees.'' Istomin is accepting
what he terms ``reasonable'' fees.
   ``I'm playing in a lot of communities which would otherwise not
hear me, on a magnificently prepared, superb piano, playing a good
program. It's giving me a lot of gratification.''
   From January through May, his solo piano recitals are east of
Chicago. The western tour will start in September in Texas.
   Istomin, whose wife, Marta, is artistic director of the Kennedy
Center for Performing Arts in Washington, is always on the move.
Last fall, he played a recital in Brussels, ate a sandwich in his
hotelroom at midnight, arose at 5 a.m. to fly to Paris where he
boarded the Concorde to New York. He was met at Kennedy Airport,
handed a tuxedo, taken to rehearsals for the Grammy Lifetime
Achievement Award show and played that night on the televised show
to honor Isaac Stern.
   ``You can not perform to your maximum ability, doing it this
way, and I didn't,'' he said. ``It's the wrong way to do things.''
   His intention now is to perform by making short hops from town
to town for a few years or more.
   ``This tour is the right way to do things,'' he said. ``When you
play, it doesn't have to be only for the fancy swells and
sophisticates. The same kind of people, who read the same kind of
books and listen to the same kind of music, live in smaller towns.''
   The tour began at a college in Winter Park, Fla., with the
second concert at a senior citizens center outside Miami.
   Istomin has two programs. Program A includes Bach, Schubert,
Beethoven, Debussy and Chopin. He has recorded Program B for ADA, a
French company that releases compact discs. He calls it ``a bit
more esoteric. Schumann's `First Sonata' isn't often played. It was
written to murder the hands of pianists. It's terribly difficult
and beautifully inspired, not the kind of piece you normally take
on a barnstorming tour.''
   He also will play Debussy and some infrequently heard
Rachmaninoff on Program B. ``That's what my pianos really serve
for,'' Istomin said. ``These pieces require a sophisticated brand
of piano playing I can offer with these instruments.''
   Istomin has been thinking about a tour such as the one he's
doing for years. ``I started playing at 17. I played 200 concerts
in my first two seasons. I was soloist with the Busch Chamber
Orchestra, paid $250 a week by Columbia Artists Management.''
   His first of more than 40 recordings was Bach's ``D Minor Piano
Concerto'' with the Busch players in 1945.
   ``I played concerts with umbrellas stuck under the sounding
board and keys that wouldn't go down,'' he said. ``I would
complain. People would say, `He's a nasty young man.' The good part
of it was that some very high-level music-making was done. I was
part of it. I know we had a lot of success and people enjoyed the
concerts.''
   He'll probably give 100 concerts this year, too. ``I had the
stamina half a century ago. I hope I have it now,'' the artist
said. ``I'm 62. I feel like I'm 26 and hysterical. I think I never
grew up.
   ``The concerts are strenuous but the traveling is easier these
days.'' Cities are not more than 300 miles apart; Istomin and the
piano technician drive by car, and luggage oes in the van with the
piano.
   ``I like playing in unpretentious circumstances,'' he said.
``Pretention is not the same as excellence. I think the public,
wherever the town, is people who react to and feel what is
happening. To me, that's the whole meaning of this trip.
   ``I'm not warming up for a program in some big hall. I've
already played these pieces in New York and London. I want to play
in Winter Park, Fla., the way I play in Carnegie Hall.
   ``Sometimes people ask me to sign a program they've saved 35
years. Those people touch me. I want to do something really nice
for those people, for whom music really matters.''
   Istomin played at a General Motors cancer research award dinner
in Washington in 1981.
   ``They sent me a check for $7,000, my regular fee. I sent it
back, donating it to Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research.
They were touched by that and said to let them know if there was
ever anything they could do for me. When I started thinking about
this tour, I thought maybe they would help me.''
   GM designed a van, with a hydraulic lift and temperature
control, to carry Istomin's piano and is lending it to him free.
The tour itself doesn't have corporate sponsorship.

   You've heard it before and you'll hear it again: The success of
your paint job will depend on how much time and effort you put into
the preparation.
   It's nice to see the paint transform your lackluster walls and
ceilings into gleaming brightness or unblemished freshness, but the
pleasure will disappear quickly if you haven't prepared the
surfaces properly.
   Proper preparation means freeing the interior of loose dirt,
peeling paint, oil and grease. It also means spackling all cracks
and holes with spackling compound or patching plaster. The patches
should be primed before the final coat of paint goes on, but read
the label on the paint can to determine the manner of treatment.
   Some professionals and many do-it-yourselfers apply a primer
even when no patching has been done.
   It is especially important that any gloss be removed from the
surfaces, since new paint does not adhere well to slick or shiny
walls and ceilings. The gloss can be steel-wooled, sanded or given
a coat of a special liquid that dulls the shine. Unlike a few years
ago, oil and latex paints can be used fairly well over each other,
but a primer will insure an excellent result. The assumption is
that you will be using a good paint, since it is poor economy to
choose a low-quality paint when it is your own ``elbow grease''
that is being utilized. Latex paints have little or no odor and
make it easier to clean up after the job is completed.
   Follow the rule-of-thumb that a high gloss paint usually is more
washable, resists moisture and wears well, which is why it is
preferred in kitchens and bathrooms. Flat paints are the choice in
most living rooms and bedrooms, being easier on the eyes. A
semi-gloss paint is what the name implies, about halfway between
the gloss and flat.
   The ideal way to prepare a room for painting is to remove
everything from it, but this may be impractical. At least take out
the lighter objects, moving the heavier pieces to the center of the
room and covering them with a dropcloth or whatever is handy.
   All electrical switch plates, doorknobs, etc., can be taken off,
but be extra careful about exposing any electric wires. Ceiling
fixtures can be dropped slightly to make the painting easier.
   In a casual room, you might want to try unusual effects. There
are special rollers to give you offbeat results. You can do the
same thing by dragging or swirling brushes, whisk brooms, sponges
and rags across the paint while it is still wet, keeping in mind
that easy does it if you want to avoid a mess. To find out what
kind of results these gimmicky styles of painting will produce, try
practicing on something like a piece of scrap wallboard.
   When you have estimated the amount of paint you will need, it's
a good idea to buy an extra amount. For one thing, you always find
something more you want to paint to blend in with the room. It may
be only a bookcase or two, but if you have it on hand, it can be
used at some later time for a touch-up job.
   Buying the same kind of paint at a future time does not always
assure that the shade will be identical with the original.
   Some people just don't order enough the first time because they
don't want to pay for unused paint. But many paint dealers will
take back an unopened can if too much time hasn't elapsed. Should
you think that might be a problem, ask the dealer about the
possibility.
   You may want to get on with the painting and not worry about
whether you are trying to make a room seem larger or smaller, but
if the latter concerns you, the proper color is the answer. Want to
make something in a room ``disappear''? Paint it the same color as
the room itself. Want to make it stand out? Paint it a contrasting
color.
   If a room is long and narrow and you want it to seem a bit
shorter, using white paint on two of the walls and a soft warm
color on the two end walls will do the trick. When a side wall is
painted white or a cool color, the room will appear to be wider. In
the same way, a hallway that is too narrow can be made to seem
wider if a side wall is painted white or cool.
   Warm colors _ red, yellow, red-orange, yellow-orange and
variations of red _ make it cool. Thus, theoretically, rooms which
get very little sunlight are best painted warm colors, those with
lots of sunlight cool colors. In actuality, other factors,
including the shapes of the rooms and their decorative features,
usually affect the choice of colors, not to mention personal
preferences.

   Painting the outside of a house is never easy, but there's a
certain amount of satisfaction in watching the paint work its magic.
   But getting the surface ready for the paint is another matter.
Caulking cracks, countersinking popped nails, scraping blistered
and peeled areas, removing mildew, priming where necessary and
performing the other preparatory steps all add up to plain work
without the visual compensation of the actual painting.
   Yet you must perform the preliminary phase of the operation with
some degree of dedication or you will pay for it later.
   A house not adequately prepared may look very much the same as
one that has been given the full treatment, but it is only a
question of time before the difference is seen.
   The let's-get-it-over-with process begins to peel, blister,
check or flake. The take-your-time-but-do-it-right formula pays
dividends in the form of a continuous good appearance.
   Poor paint, or the failure to handle the brush, roller or spray
gun properly often gets the blame for what is nothing more than
inadequate preparation.
   If you do not have the time or the inclination to get the house
ready to paint, don't do it.
   Check on whether the paint you plan to use will work well on the
kind of surface you are covering. Oil-based, alkyds and
oil-modified alkyds all are excellent for wood siding, but the
majority of do-it-yourselfers prefer latexes because they have
blister resistance and, since water is the solvent, they make
cleaning up a lot easier.
   Once regarded as less likely to ``cover'' than other paints,
they now have good hiding ability. Some can be applied even over a
damp surface. Read the label on the container to see whether a
primer is required, especially if the latex is being put over an
oil paint designed to chalk.
   If brick or other masonry is being painted, be sure you have an
exterior paint formulated for use on such surfaces. Oil paints do
not work well on any material containing cement, which has an
alkali content that attacks the paint.
   Exterior wood shakes or shingles usually are stained, although
they can be painted. Once they have been stained, they should be
stained again when a second treatment is necessary. While you can
paint over stain at a later time, a careful priming is required to
prevent bleeding. If you paint the first time, you cannot stain
later without removing the paint, which can be a messy job on
shakes or shingles.
   When covering this kind of wood when a house is new, look over
the various kinds of stains and pigmented sealers on the market.
Manufacturers of some of the pigmented types say they are more
durable than the clear coatings. Incidentally, you can get finishes
with mildewcides in them or add a mildew-resistant compound to
other finishes.
   As you paint, follow the sun; that is, paint where the sun just
has been. In that way, you will not risk having the sun dry out the
paint too quickly. It's also a lot more comfortable painting while
in the shade.
   If you are using an extension ladder, use it with caution. Most
accidents occur when a person leans over too far. Instead, get down
and move the ladder. It may be a little more trouble and take a
little more time, but it will keep you from getting hurt.
   Work from the top of a house, usually in the left hand corner,
and continue downward.
   Always work in toward the wet paint, using wide, firm strokes.
Dip the brush about halfway and pat off the excess on the side of
the container. If you are using a roller, be sure it does not take
up too much paint and do not spin the roller at the end of a
stroke. With a roller, work from a dry area into a wet one.
   Color changes the seeming appearance of a house. If you want
something to be inconspicuous, such as a garage door, paint it the
same color as the main part of the house. A house looks smaller
when it is painted with dark colors. Light colors, of course, have
the opposite effect. When a house seems to be too tall, paint it
the same color as the roof. If you want it to seem higher, paint
the siding a contrasting color.
   If you have been content with the colors on your house over the
years, don't experiment. Choose the same or nearly the same colors.

   In painting indoors, rollers cover surfaces more quickly and
easier than brushes, but brushes may be necessary for detailed work.
   Consider the use of edging rollers. Another possibility is the
use of extension handles on the rollers so that you can paint the
ceiling while standing on the floor. Should you do so, remember
that you will avoid a stiff neck if you paint the ceiling area
ahead of you rather than directly overhead.
   Do not overload the roller or apply too much pressure.
   And whether using a roller or brush, always paint from a dry
area into a wet one, overlapping slightly.

Living, an annual buyer's guide to residential sunspaces.)

   A sunspace can transform an ordinary room into an attractive,
bright living space. It can also serve as a source of solar heat
for your home and a place in which you can garden the year 'round.
   Basically, a sunspace is a light-frame enclosure made of several
components, including glass or other transparent glazing, aluminum
or wood framing, windows, skylights and sliding glass doors. The
words greenhouse, sunspace, solarium, and sunroom are used
interchangeably to describe this structure.
   Pre-engineered sunspace kits are available in a variety of sizes
and styles. Many manufacturers offer standard models suitable for
most homes, budgets and tastes; a few offer the ability to give you
the most exacting custom designs.
   Standard models come in wood or aluminum. They can be further
classified by the shape of the eave _ the area where the sunspace
roof meets the vertical wall _ which can be either straight or
curved.
   Curved eaves have aesthetic and functional importance. From a
stylistic point of view, curved glass gives you an unobstructed
view normally interrupted by the roof edge in a straight eave
sunspace. Functionally, the curved eave is an aerodynamic shape,
making it more resistant to air leaks during high winds. Less air
infiltration means an overall higher energy efficiency.
   The greenhouse kits available on the market provide a variety of
standard options including: a range of glazing materials; insulated
panels for the roof, endwalls and the basewall of the sunspace;
operable glazed units; movable insulation and shading systems;
thermostatically controlled ventilation systems; and thermal
storage accessories.
   New technologies and a range of services and components make it
a greenhouse shopper's paradise these days. There are also a
variety of handbooks and solar construction manuals that offer
guidance on ``do-it-yourself'' sunspace retrofits, using
conventional building materials and off-the-shelf components.
However, it is recommended that an architect, engineer or builder
be consulted before you undertake any major alterations of your
home.
   There are four major factors that will decide the sunspace right
for you: location, use, size and cost.
   When planning your sunspace, start with the factor by which you
are most constrained, and go from there. For example, if there is
only one feasible spot for an addition to your house, then location
will be the overriding factor. This will in turn affect the use of
your sunspace; for example, the degree to which this location is
facing south will limit your use of this addition as a solar heater.
   Beside increasing the overall value of your home, a solarium can
be a great solar heater. In order to take the best advantage of
this asset, the greenhouse glass should face true south. However,
you can build a solarium facing as much as 45 degrees to the east
or west of south and suffer only a 20 percent loss of winter
sunshine.
   If you have several places on your south-facing wall where your
solarium can be located, there are other considerations which will
help you determine the best solar heater location. If your house is
L- or U-shaped, try to locate the sunspace so that it is sheltered
within this shape, to limit the heat loss through the endwalls of
the sunspace.
   While today's sunspaces usually perform one of three basic
functions _ growing plants, solar heating, or providing shelter _
the shelter aspects are probably the most intriguing. The sunspace
provides an attractive and sunlit living space that can house a
myriad of activities.
   Most sunspaces serve several purposes. During the day, for
example, a sunspace may have the dual function of collecting and
storing heat while also providing a place to grow plants. In the
evening, you and your family may enjoy it as an informal space.
   The warming sunshine streaming into your sunspace at certain
times can overheat the room and create a costly additional load on
your air conditioning system. Shading is one of the best solutions
to this problem. The materials you select to shade your windows
should be styled to fit the design scheme of your home, but must
also perform well under the additional heat and light to which they
will be exposed in your sunspace. Although most conventional window
treatments such as draperies, blinds or shutters can be designed
for your sunspace, the best protection will come from those systems
that prevent the sun from ever reaching the glass. These systems
include exterior awnings and sunscreens.
   Interior shading systems are most effective if they incorporate
a good solar-reflecting surface material on the exterior side. This
principle can be applied to traditional fabric shades, blinds,
shutters and drapes.
   Insulated shades are a relatively new development in shading
systems, designed to prevent heat loss in winter and at night and
also used to reduce summer heat gain. The shades are composed of
reflective liners, insulating batting and a decorative interior
covering. Hardware includes an edge sealing system which
dramatically cuts air leakage. Interior thermal shades are easier
to operate and maintain than movable exterior insulation and are
available with motorized and sun sensor controls.

   People with solariums and greenhouses can be happier and
healthier than those who don't have a steady supply of outdoor
light, says a physiologist who is also a greenhouse franchisee.
   ``Natural daylight is a very beneficial `drug-less' therapy for
conditions ranging from gloomy moods on cloudy days to colds,
muscular aches and pains and even, in some cases, migraine
headaches,'' says Ken Bondi. He operates a Four Seasons Greenhouses
center in Norwich, Conn.
   ``Natural light also provides a healthful environment for people
who exercise at home,'' he says. ``Doing aerobics or lifting
weights in a solarium or greenhouse addition lets you exercise
`outdoors' while staying inside your home.''
   Americans are spending more than $400 million a year to 40,000
new sunspaces on their homes, according to Lee Stanley, chairman of
Solar Additions Inc., of Greenwich, N.Y. He predicts it will grow
to between $1 billion and $2 billion in the 1990s.
   ``The sunspace has evolved from a greenhouse for indoor plant
growing into a room central to modern homemaking,'' says Stanley.
``Today people are adding sunspaces for kitchens which once again
have become a major focus for homemakers.
   ``People are even specifying room add-ons as bathrooms.''

   If you are remodeling your kitchen and thinking about putting in
new cabinets, you might want to consider giving your old ones a
facelift instead. As a do-it-yourself project, it can save you
money and at the same time get the quality look that you want.
   A newly introduced solid oak kitchen cabinet refacing system
packages contemporary-styled solid oak cabinet doors, drawer fronts
and matching peel-and-stick oak veneer into a step-by-step
procedure designed especially for the do-it-yourselfer and one that
requires no special tools or carpentry skills.
   The system offers a variety of cabinet doors and drawer fronts
to accommodate almost any kitchen cabinet you might have. Cabinet
doors and drawer fronts both are three-quarters of an inch thick,
with door fronts available in two panel styles. Cabinet fronts come
in nine standard door sizes; drawer fronts are available in three
sizes. Non-standard door sizes can be adjusted using framing
strips. The refacing system also includes matching peel-and-stick
oak veneer for application over all front cabinet frame surfaces
and exposed ends. The veneer features specially formulated
pressure-sensitive adhesive to provide easy application as well as
durability.
   The refacing process is a four-step procedure that anyone with
basic do-it-yourself skills can perform. Installing cabinet doors
and applying the matching veneer is done as follows:
   1. Remove all old cabinet doors, hinges and catches.
   2. Match pre-selected doors with the appropriate cabinet door
openings.
   3. Apply peel-and-stick oak veneer over all old face frames and
exposed side panels.
   4. Apply the finish, add new hardware and complete the
installation of the doors.
   Installing new drawer fronts involves a similar four-step
procedure:
   1. Remove all drawers from cabinets and take off all handles,
knobs or raised moldings. It is not necessary to remove the
existing drawer fronts themselves because the new solid oak ones
mount over the old ones. The replacement drawer fronts come in
three sizes which will accommodate nearly all drawer sizes.
   2. Using a hand saw, cut off any lip or overhang on your
existing drawer fronts so that they are flush with the sides, top
and bottom of the drawer.
   3. Line up the new drawer front so that it centers over the
trimmed drawer and covers the drawer opening completely.
   4. Apply the finish, then, from the face side of the new drawer
front, drill holes so you can attach new drawer handles. In most
instances the screws used to attach the handles will be adequate to
secure the new drawer front in place. Complete the installation of
the drawer fronts.
   According to Masonite Corp., which handles the refacing system,
the average kitchen is composed of 15 cabinet doors and 11 drawer
fronts which take between 16 to 24 hours to reface and finish.
   For the relatively few hours involved, refacing may be the
answer for the do-it-yourself enthusiast. Another advantage is less
disruption to the normal everyday use of your kitchen. While you
are refacing your cabinets, you still have the use of them, and
avoid the mess that comes when you tear out your old ones and
replace with new ones.

   Most of the time we don't do anything about the roof on the
house until it does something to us.
   When there is a leak or storm damage, we move into action,
hiring a professional or attempting a do-it-yourself repair. But
when a roof needs replacement, the pro gets the call.
   Putting down a new roof not only requires knowledge and skill,
it needs the attention of someone who knows how to move about
safely on high ladders and sloped surfaces.
   One way a homeowner can aid his cause is to keep minor damage
from becoming major. Check the roof periodically, a couple of times
a year or more often when there is a reason for such an
examination. The check is especially important if the roof is more
than 15 years old. That's the time when a house is a prime
candidate for reroofing, although the life expectancy of a roof can
be longer than that if top materials are used.
   Remember that the cost of labor and application is often the
same, regardless of the projected life of the roof.
   Checking the roof does not involve getting on it. You can do it
from the ground with the aid of binoculars. Look for signs of wind
damage. Cracked, curled, loose or missing shingles spell trouble.
An excessive loss of granules from the shingles is a sign of wear.
Even if you know very little about roofs, common sense will tell
you when something doesn't look right.
   Resist the temptation to get on the roof to check at close
range. Leave that kind of inspection to a roofer.
   Since you are at the mercy of a roofing contractor to find out
what is wrong and whether it can be fixed or replaced, find one who
comes well recommended. If you are told your roof needs replacing,
get more than one opinion on the problem and what it will cost to
solve it. Be sure all contractors are bidding on the same plans and
materials.
   Before signing a contract, be certain it specifies the work to
be done and materials to be used, completion dates, warranties and
guarantees of both the contractor and manufacturer, removal of
waste materials, final price and method of payment.
   Among available roof coverings, asphalt shingles are the most
widely used roof material. They are attractive, economical by
comparison, and durable. There are endless varieties, among them
the glass-based, three-dimensional, multi-layered, textured and
other types. There is roll roofing for roofs with little pitch,
built-up roofing, aluminum shingles, wood shingles and concrete and
ceramic tiles, as well as slate and terne.
   Your roofer must decide whether your new roof can be applied
directly over the old one. In most cases, asphalt shingles can be
laid over asphalt and wood shingles. And some ordinances forbid
reroofing over two or more layers of shingles. No matter what the
regulations, your roofer has to determine whether your roof deck
can support another set of shingles.
   A new roof should require only minimal maintenance. But keep
gutters, downspouts and roof surfaces clear of leaves, twigs and
other litter so that water will drain freely and not back up.
   Never allow water from one roof portion to pour directly on to
another.
   Keep trees trimmed to prevent branches from scuffing or other
damaging the roof.
   And, for your sake, as well as that of the roof, stay off it.

   Chain saws have become familiar workhorses around the home as
homeowners use them to cut firewood and roots, clear storm damage
and trim trees and large shrubbery. But many chain saw owners do
not know how to take care of them properly and can end up with
costly repair bills.
   A chain saw owner needs to perform an annual maintenance check
to ensure trouble-free operation. Solo Inc. experts have developed
a 10-step maintenance checklist that can be performed with a few
standard tools and a little spare time.
   You are advised to check the owner's manual for specific
maintenance instructions and to perform the procedures during the
``off'' season. For safety reasons, always wear gloves and safety
glasses when following these steps in maintaining your chain saw:
   1. Drain any remaining fuel from the saw's tank or run the
engine until it is empty.
   2. Using a garden hose, clean the entire unit while being
careful not to get water into the gas tank.
   3. Remove and clean saw chain, bar and guide bar. Don't forget
to wear gloves.
   4. Remove spark plug and replace it with a new one every year.
Be sure to set the correct spark plug gap.
   5. Close the choke and remove the air filter assembly. Clean the
filter with a stiff paint brush and soap and water or replace it if
necessary.
   6. Remove the fuel cap, locate the fuel pick-line inside the
tank and ``fish'' it out. You may want to use an 8-inch piece of
coat hanger that has a ``U'' bend at one end. Replace line or
filter if dirty and put cap back on the tank.
   7. Use an allen wrench or screwdriver to remove the starter
assembly. Clean filter openings with a rag or brush, remove debris
and replace any worn parts.
   8. Visually inspect all vibration isolators to be sure they are
not worn out, torn, cracked, broken or loose. Check manual for
exact locations of isolators.
   9. Check spark plugs arrestor screen for buildup and clean or
replace if rips or performations are present. Clean with water or a
wooden ``pop'' stick, making sure not to tear holes in the filter.
   10. With gloves on, grasp muffler to check that it is not loose
and does not rattle. Replace if necessary.
   When finished, double check to make sure all parts have been
properly replaced, all screws and bolts have been tightened and
there are no pieces left over.

   Keeping kitchen knives razor sharp and in mint condition is an
art. With practice and patience, most people can master traditional
techniques, but modern technology also offers simpler and more
effective solutions to a drawer full of dull blades.
   ``However you choose to sharpen your knives, do it frequently,
rather than once or twice a year,'' says chef Lou Bouchenot,
gourmet and cooking instructor. ``In fact, for maximum
effectiveness, knives should be sharpened after every use.''
   The most popular tool for reviving dull knives is the butcher's
or sharpening steel. It is relatively easy to use, but does not
actually sharpen a blade. Instead, it realigns the bent fibers of
the blade and evens out the edge where they have broken off.
   The safest way to ``steel'' a blade is by grasping the knife in
one hand and holding the steel perpendicular to a cutting board
with the other. Then, position the heel of the blade _ the part
closest to the handle _ at a 20-degree angle to the rod of the
steel just below the handle.
   With a quick swinging motion, bring the knife down and across
the steel until the tip reaches the bottom. Repeat the process with
the other side of the blade. About six strokes on each side should
complete the job.
   ``The trick to steeling is maintaining the proper angle and
using a consistent amount of pressure throughout the process,''
says Buchenot, culinary consultant to Wilkinson Sword, Inc. ``If
you don't, the edge will be uneven and perhaps too dull or so sharp
that it will wear away quickly.''
   An easier and more convenient alternative is a set of
self-sharpening knives, which contains its own automatic sharpening
cassettes and, unlike a steel, actually puts a new edge on a knife.
Each knife's individual storage compartment contains one of these
cassettes so that knives are automatically sharpened before and
after each use.
   The cassette works similarly to many popular sharpening tools,
but eliminates all the guesswork. It houses two angled
tungsten-carbide sharpening blocks and is scientifically engineered
to hold the blade at the correct angle as it is sharpened. A
spring-load mechanism insures consistent pressure throughout the
process. Sharpening takes place with one smooth continuous motion,
ensuring an even edge. The knives are dishwasher-safe and virtually
maintenance-free. Sharpening cassettes, however, may be removed
from the unit and should be washed occasionally to remove any
debris.
   However, if you are a die-hard do-it-yourselfer, you can try
your hand at giving traditional knives a new edge yourself with a
whetstone.
   Use a medium grade stone to start and finish with a finer grade.
Lubricate each with honing oil or a half-and-half mixture of
machine oil and kerosene.
   To sharpen, place the whetstone on a flat surface and hold the
blade at one end of the stone at a 20-degree angle to its surface.
With one smooth motion, bring the blade diagonally across the stone
to the opposite end, gradually shifting pressure from the heel to
tip of the blade.
   Turn the blade over and repeat the process starting at the other
end of the stone. Continue with alternating sides until sharpened.
   ``Again, maintaining the correct angle and applying consistent
pressure is important,'' says Bouchenot.

   Removing old wallpaper before a refinishing project can be done
quicker and easier with a variable temperature control heat gun.
   Here are some tips from Harry W. Earl, brand manager for Emhart
Corp.'s Thermostrip:
   _ Moisten a section of the old wallpaper with water.
   _ Set the heat gun at full power, holding the nozzle three
inches from the wall and direct the hot air at a seam.
   _ As adhesive begins to soften, gently loosen the paper with a
scraper, then peel off.
   _ Continue moistening the wallpaper throughout the process.

   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. has
announced it will begin purchasing a new type of adjustable rate
mortgage which allows home buyers to convert their loans to
fixed-rate mortgages.
   These convertible mortgages have become popular with home buyers
because they offer the advantage of lower initial rates along with
the chance to convert to fixed-rate mortgages later if rates drop.
   The action was announced by Leland Brendsel, president of the
corporation, which is popularly known as Freddie Mac. It follows a
decision by the Federal National Mortgage Association, known as
Fannie Mae, to purchase convertible mortgages as well.
   The two organizations, which purchase mortgages from local
lenders, have a major impact on what will be available to home
buyers because local lenders generally follow their guidelines in
order to insure that their mortgages can be resold in the secondary
market.
   The Freddie Mac announcement said it would buy convertible
mortgages with rates that adjust yearly with caps of 1 percent to 2
percent on the amount interest rates can change in a single year.
   The convertible mortgages must also offer homeowners the option
of switching from an adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed rate from
the beginning of the first year of the mortgage to the end of the
sixth year.

   Baths and kitchens top the list of rooms that homeowners choose
to remodel, says the National Kitchen and Bath Association, which
projects that nearly 10 million consumers will replace one of those
rooms in 1988.
   More than 5.5 million kitchens were remodeled last year,
according to the association.
   ``Both rooms have a high return on investment when it comes time
to sell a home,'' says Francis Jones, executive director of the
trade group.
   Other reasons for what he says is a 14 percent increase over
last year in the number of people remodeling those rooms include
more discretionary income and a trend toward staying home. ``A good
portion of that income is going into home improvements,
particularly the kitchen and bath,'' he says.
   ``Consumers want all the options _ whirlpool tubs, steam
features in their showers, ranges with grill features, wine
coolers.''
   The kitchen, in particular, may be becoming more personalized,
say kitchen designers, who see it as a ``family activity center.''
   ``Kitchens are expanding by combining several adjacent family
areas, often spilling over into the great room,'' says David
Hundley, marketing manager for Wilsonart, producers of decorative
laminate surfacing. ``Kitchens are no longer used just for cooking,
but have become areas to socialize, do the laundry, sew or work at
the home computer.''
   Kitchens are becoming more practical, says a designer,
incorporating several areas into the same space.
   ``The laundry room might be a part of the kitchen, concealed
behind doors, a desk area for the family computer, a baking center
equipped with storage space for bulky mixing tools hidden behind
tambour garages, an area for potting plants, a place to barbecue or
even sew,'' says Gay Fly, president of Gay Fly Interiors, Houston.
   Among the more popular remodeling plans for kitchens are those
that remove the walls between the kitchen and family room, allowing
plenty of space for socializing, according to Richard M. Rozic,
vice president of builder sales for White Consolidated Industries,
appliance manufacturers.
   The bathroom, too, is getting more remodeling attention,
according to many manufacturers and designers.
   Some designers now consider the room a ``stress reduction
center,'' complete with exercise equipment, sauna, whirlpool and
television set.
   ``Oversized and two-person showers designed with
multi-showerheads and controls are popular. Large closets and
utility areas are also showing up,'' says designer Fly.
   ``Everything is designed to accommodate more than one person in
the bathroom.''

   The use of vinyl for window frames is growing as an alternative
to aluminum and wood for home repair and remodeling in the United
States, according to a trade association which says its product has
grown about 20 percent annually over the last five years.
   Vinyl window frames account for almost a quarter of the 22.5
million replacement windows installed in American homes annually,
says Julie Cahn, executive director of the Vinyl Window and Door
Institute.
   Some newer replacement windows are combining wood and solid
vinyl or aluminum.
   ``There's been a design revolution going on the past decade
within the window industry,'' says K. Eric Ekstrom, of the National
Wood Window and Door Association.
   ``What's more, consumers are learning all they can about new
product designs and performance improvements,'' he says. ``New
design innovations and tougher manufacturing standards have helped
wood windows, or vinly- and aluminum-clad windows with solid wood
cores, remain one of the most popular materials for replacement
projects.''

   Finding a chip, gouge or hole on a piece of furniture does not
mean it's ruined. Damaged furniture can be restored with a patching
material made just for wood.
   Most furniture will receive some damage with heavy use. Chances
are that furniture bought at a yard sale or auction will have at
least one chip or gouge.
   Restoring furniture is simple, rewarding, and saves money on
professional repair bills. The trick is knowing what materials to
use and how to do the work.
   For your repair work, a premixed, synthetic compound gives good
results. One kind is made of latex and pulverized wood for a patch
of maximum workability and woodlike texture.
   For generations, cabinet-makers made their own patching material
by mixing hot animal glue or vinyl resin with fine sawdust. Some
purists still make their own wood patch, substituting woodworkers
glue for animal glue.
   Synthetic latex compounds are easy to use. You apply them from
the container with a putty knife, or directly into voids from a
plastic squeeze tube. They can be nailed, sawed, sanded or drilled,
and can be used for repairs both indoors and out.
   Patching damaged furniture, whether unfinished, painted or
stained, is easy enough for any do-it-yourselfer.
   First, to remove dirt, grease, oil and loose particles from the
damaged area, rub the surface with a lint-free cloth dampened with
mineral spirits, paint thinner, or a liquid sander.
   Wait 30 minutes for the surface to dry, then dampen the area to
be repaired with water. Water stops the wood from absorbing
moisture in the latex wood patch. Otherwise, the patching material
cures too quickly and might shrink and crack.
   John Molski, technical director of United Gilsonite
Laboratories, Scranton, Pa., offers these tips for using a latex
wood putty:
   ``Press the patching material tightly into the void with a putty
knife. Fill holes that are less than one-quarter inch deep and wide
in one application. Make sure the patch is slightly higher than the
surrounding wood.
   ``Wipe off the excess material around the hole with a dampened
cloth. When the patch is dry, sand it until it's level with the
surrounding surface.''
   Holes more than one-quarter inch deep and wide, Molski says,
should be filled with several layers of patch. Let each layer dry
befre applying the next.
   Sand the repair, using medium-grade sandpaper attached to a
sanding block. Failure to use a sanding block can result in ripples
on the patch and surrounding wood. This is especially true when
sanding softwoods like pine.
   Always sand with the wood grain. When done, wipe the surface
with a tack cloth or clean rag dampened with mineral spirits to
remove dust.
   The drying time for wood patching products differs. Read the
label before sanding, painting or staining.
   Follow normal surface preparations before refinishing the
damaged area.
   A refinishing tip: to improve the color match between the latex
patch and the wood, mix some finish with the patching material
before repairing the damage. Test the patch on an inconspicuous
part of the wood _ the underside of a table, for instance _ to see
if it blends with the original finish.
   If you have trouble matching the patch with a stained surface,
mix a combination of maple, mahogany and walnut stain with the
patching compond. With a little work, you can match almost any
stain using these three colors.
   Do not confuse wood patching products with paste wood fillers.
The fillers are designed for filling the open grains in certain
hardwoods like oak, mahogany and walnut prior to finishing.
   Hiding minor scratches does not require the use of a wood patch.
For a simple fix, rub a wet tea bag or shoe polish on the scratch.
Specially designed wax sticks can also be used. They are available
in different colors.
   If you're looking for the country look, repair major damage such
as broken legs or rotted wood, but leave surface blemishes and
minor scratches alone. These random markings give the piece its
character.

   With warm weather coming, wood furniture and fixtures will need
special care, advises wood care authority Homer Formsby.
   He offers these tips:
   _ To protect your furniture from the strong summer sun, keep
furniture away from direct sunlight and rearrange your furniture so
that one piece doesn't receive all the exposure. Install drapes or
shades that can be drawn during the sun's strongest hours.
   _ To protect furniture from high humidity, regularly apply a
furniture treatment (not a furniture polish) to replace the wood's
natural moisture. (Don't use linseed oil on wood, since it can
darken, mildew and let off an unpleasant odor.)
   _ To protect furniture from summer dirt and dust, ``deep clean''
the wood by wiping the surface with mineral spirits or furniture
cleaner on a cotton cloth, repeating until the cloth remains clean.
Once the wood is thoroughly cleaned, regular use of a furniture
treatment will clean everyday dirt and pollution.
   _ Avoid sitting on wood furniture in a wet bathing suit; the
moisture can become trapped and leave white spots. To repair the
spots, first let the furniture sit for 24 hours to see if the
moisture evaporates on its own. If it doesn't, buff the area with a
50-50 mixture of toothpaste and baking soda on a damp cotton cloth.

   The ABCs of home insulation usually come down to R.
   The letter stands for resistance to heat flow _ heat gain in the
summer and heat loss in the winter. The higher the ``R-value'' of
the insulation, the greater the insulating power.
   Determining what R-value is most effective in your home depends
on the region and fuel sources. For example, in Kansas City, Mo.,
if you're insulating your attic and the energy source is natural
gas, a minimum R-value of 30 is recommended by the Department of
Energy.
   Critical areas to be insulated include walls between heated and
unheated areas, basement walls, floors above unheated crawl spaces
and masonry walls in heated crawl spaces.
   ``Installing insulation is a relatively simple and inexpensive
do-it-yourself project,'' says Thomas Seymour of Owens-Corning
Fiberglas Corp. ``One of the most common homeowner projects,
insulating the attic, only costs about $300 to $350 for an average
1,000-square-foot space,'' he says.
   ``To insulate your attic,'' Seymour says, ``the only tools
you'll need are a sharp knife, a straight-edge, a measuring tape, a
long-sleeved shirt, a mask, a pair of work gloves and safety
glasses. Installation is simply a matter of measuring the area to
be insulated, cutting the material to fit and laying between the
joists or studs.''
   The most common types of insulation are fiberglass batts and
blankets, loose-fill, blown-in urethane foam, and rigid-board.
   Fiberglass batt and blanket insulation are the same material
packaged differently. Batts are precut in floor-to-ceiling lengths,
and blankets come in rolls that must be cut to length.
   Loose-fill insulation is made of fiberglass, rock wool,
vermiculite or other mineral products that are either poured or
blown into place with a high-pressure air nozzle.
   According to Better Homes and Gardens Building Ideas magazine,
the advantage of loose-fill is that it seals around plumbing pipes
and electrical wires and outlets and it can be blown into place
without tearing out walls. But, the magazine notes, loose-fill
tends to settle and compress over time and can lead to voids in the
tops of wall cavities.
   Settlement is not a problem with foams, but shrinkage can affect
the foam's airtightness, Building Ideas says.

   Home workshops most often are in basements or garages, probably
the poorest lit areas of the house.
   A combination of background and task lighting can alleviate the
problem and free the work space of glare and shadows, says Jim
Jensen, technical lighting specialist at General Electric.
   He recommends two 48-inch fluorescent tubes centered over the
front edge of the work bench, 48 inches above the work area.
   For extra lighting for detail work, Jensen advises supplementary
spotlighting. ``A lamp with a 50-watt reflector bulb, for example,
can be clamped near task areas, like vises or drill presses,'' he
says. ``Clamp-on fixtures are ideal for the workshop because they
allow you to move the light to areas where it is most needed.''

   Power tools make do-it-yourselfing easier and faster, but every
homeowner knows how impossible it is to take care of things around
the house without various kinds of hand tools.
   For most purposes, you can get along without an electrical saw
or a belt sander, but here are countless household tasks that
cannot be handled without a screwdriver or hammer or wrench or
pliers.
   Whether you have an organized home workshop or merely a
collection of tools that grew each time an emergency occurred, you
know well the value of non-electric implements.
   There are some things you should keep in mind when hand tools
are purchased and used. Here are a few of them:
   _ HAMMERS: A 16-ounce nail hammer is best for the novice, but it
should not be used for masonry nails, cold chisels or other metal.
For striking the very small hand chisels and punches and for
riveting, shaping and straightening unhardened metal, use a
16-ounce ball peen hammer. A three-pound so-called drilling hammer
of plastic, rubber, wood or rawhide is needed if you work with
surfaces that could be damaged by a metal striking face.
   _ SCREWDRIVERS: You will need several screwdrivers of different
sizes. While they should be of the standard slotted type, it is
well to own at least one Phillips screwdriver, which works with
cross-slotted screwheads. When possible, buy a set of screwdrivers
rather than one.
   _ WRENCHES: If you can get only one, make it an adjustable type,
which has smooth jaws and fits different kinds of nuts. But it is
not intended to replace fixed opening wrenches for many jobs. For
instance, never use an adjustable wrench to free a ``frozen'' nut
or for final tightening. A wrench should be tightly adjusted to the
nut and pulled _ never pushed _ so the force is on the side of the
fixed jaw. Never use an extension or a hammer on any wrench handle.
   _ PLIERS: Slipjoint pliers are what you should have if you have
only a small collection of hand tools. Their joints allow the jaws
to be adjusted to two positions. Later, you can buy some of many
specialty pliers on the market. _ SAWS: The crosscut saw is the one
you will use most. Backsaws are for precision work. Hacksaws are
for metal. Very useful is a ``nest'' of saws, which has three
narrow blades interchangeable on one handle. Two of the blades are
known as keyhold saws, the third is for general cutting.
   _ CHISELS: Wood chisels are, as the name implies, for use on
wood. Cold chisels are designed for use on metal and usually are
driven with a heavy hammer.
   _ PLANES: A jack plane is the most common. It is 12 to 15 inches
long and handles most jobs.
   _ FILES: The 12-inch size, with second-cut or smooth-cut teeth,
is the all-purpose file. Files come in many varieties, but the type
used on wood is called a rasp.
   There are, of course, many other hand tools, but you will find
out about these when you have a need for them. In all cases, follow
the rules of safety. Whenever practical, use workman's gloves.
Always wear goggles or some other kind of eye protector when
working with metal or doing anything which may cause chips to fly.
   And remember that dull tools cause more accidents than sharp
ones.

   Housing construction for 1987 dropped to 1.62 million units, the
slowest building pace for the housing industry since the recession
year of 1982, the Commerce Department reported.
   The total compared to construction of 1.81 million units in
1986, which had been an exceptionally strong year for the industry.
In 1982, 1.06 million units were built.
   Analysts blamed much of the weakness on widespread overbuilding
in the apartment sector and the adverse effects of the new tax law
on real estate investments.
   Building permits for the year totaled 1.54 million units, 13.1
percent below 1986 and the weakest showing since 1982.

   Sales of existing homes held steady in 1987 at close to 4
million units despite volatile mortgage rates and the October stock
market collapse, a national real estate trade group reported.
   The National Association of Realtors said that sales of existing
single-family homes and condominiums totaled 3.885 million units
last year, down a slight 0.3 percent from the 1986 level of 3.897
million units. Sales in both years were the fastest pace of this
decade.
   Meanwhile, the average price of an existing home rose to a
nationwide median of $84,900, an increase of 5.1 percent in 1987,
slightly ahead of the rise in consumer prices, the association said.

<TEXT>
   About 6,000 employees began a strike Monday over a
pay dispute at Land-Rover, the first walkout against the
state-owned automaker in about six years.
   It was also the second job action against the British automaking
industry this month. Production was resuming Monday at Ford Motor
Co. following a two-week stoppage.
   About 1,000 workers set up picket lines at the gates of the
state-owned Land-Rover plant at Solihull, just outside Birmingham
in the British Midlands.
   Huge traffic jams, some more then a mile long, nearly blocked
roads leading to the plant as the pickets stopped supervisors and
office workers in their cars and urged them not to cross the picket
line.
   The strike over a pay dispute was the first at the company since
November 1981, said a Land-Rover spokeswoman, speaking anonymously
in keeping with British custom.
   She said the strike would mean the loss of 200 Land-Rover and
Range Rover vehicles a day, with a retail value of about 3 million
pounds, or about $5.25 million.
   Land-Rover is a division of Rover Group, the vehicle
manufacturer which the government plans to sell to the private
sector. It is separate from the Rover Group's carmaking division,
Austin Rover.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said Monday that
Japan won't comply with foreign demands calling for liberalization
of rice imports.
   It was the first time Takeshita publicly declared his opposition
to lifting a ban on importing foreign rice since becoming prime
minister last November.
   ``It is natural for us to uphold the objectives of'' a Diet
resolution calling for improvements in self-sufficiency in food,
including rice, Takeshita said during a session of the lower house
Budget Committee.
   Both houses of Japan's Diet unanimously adopted a resolution
against the lifting of a rice import ban in 1980 and 1984.
   The Japanese government purchases almost all rice produced by
farmers at several times higher than an international price and
then sells it to consumers, through retail shops, for somewhat
lower prices.
   The nation's ban on rice imports has become an issue between
Japan and the United States, which says Japan has an obligation to
place its rice program on the negotiating table.
   Japan had a trade surplus of $59.8 billion last year with the
United States.
   Japanese farmers, agricultural organizations and some government
officials argue that opening up the country's rice market would not
only harm farmers but endanger Japan's food security.

   Stock prices held in a narrow range today as
traders awaited new signs of the outlook for the economy and
interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 5.64 to 2,008.95
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 546 up, 501 down and 504

   Volume on the Big Board came to 28.62 million shares as of 10

   Economists at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., for example, say
it is possible that the report will show growth of 5.5 percent or

<HEAD>Hunger Hearings Set as Milk and Cheese Aid Program Dries Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick
J. Leahy is set to raise the curtain on hearings into the problem
of hunger plaguing the nation's homeless and families living in
poverty.
   ``I know that the budget pressures will remain with us all this
year and for the foreseeable future,'' the Vermont Democrat says.
``But America's future depends on its children. The wealthiest,
most powerful nation in the world must once again resolve to
eliminate hunger in America.''
   The hearings, set to begin March 1, will come as the government
prepares to suspend distribution of milk, cheese, rice and honey to
low-income households under the Temporary Emergency Food Assistance
Program, or TEFAP, because stocks are depleted.
   Leahy says a report will be released this week dealing
specifically with the rural poor and that he intends to follow up
with hearings on the overall extent of hunger in America.
   TEFAP is best known as the program under which poor people were
able to go to community action centers and other designated places
in their neighborhoods to receive free allotments of powered milk
and cheese.
   It came into being in 1981 as the Reagan administration wrestled
with enormous surpluses of agricultural commodities and the massive
storage costs they entailed. Those huge surpluses have now been
diminished considerably by price changes under the 1985 farm law
that have discouraged excess production.
   The Agriculture Department announced Feb. 12 that dwindling
stocks will prevent TEFAP distributions of milk and cheese in May.
Rice and honey stocks will be depleted by March distributions, USDA
said. It said flour, cornmeal and butter distributions will
continue as before.
   ``Cheese, nonfat dry milk, rice and honey distributions will be
suspended when we have given it all away,'' said John W. Bode,
assistant secretary of agriculture for food and consumer services.
``When we get more, we will distribute it.''
   The department said that one in every seven Americans receives
federal food assistance at some point each year at a taxpayer cost
of more than $56 million a day. It said surplus foods amounting to
5 billion pounds worth more than $5 billion have been distributed
under TEFAP since 1981.
   According to figures compiled by the Senate Agriculture
Committee, more than 15 million people have supplemented benefits
they already receive from the food stamp program with TEFAB
commodities.
   But the panel says the 18 million people who were taking part in
the food stamp program as of September represented no more than 60
percent of those living in poverty.
   Leahy said he went to New York last week ``to survey for myself
the extent of hunger in our nation's richest city.''
   ``As a senator, I have seen poverty in the Third World that was
worse than any I have seen in the United States,'' Leahy said in a
floor speech reporting on his trip. ``But the sense of hopelessness
that I encountered in the South Bronx was as deep as any that I
have encountered in South America.''
   He said many families told him they ``cannot buy enough food _
even with food stamps _ to feed their children.'' He quoted
Christina Walker, operator of a food stamp hotline, as saying her
organization receives thousands of calls from households that run
out of food stamps.
   ``That they run out is not surprising,'' he said. ``The average
food stamp benefit is around 50 cents, per person, per meal _ the
maximum benefit is 81 cents per meal.
   ``Think about what 81 cents worth of groceries would look like _
not much. What would happen if you spilled a carton of milk _ or
dropped a carton of eggs?''
   Some individuals living in poverty are unable to obtain food
stamps because they have no address, he said.
   He also recounted the experience of a South Bronx mother of six
whom he identified as Gladys who was having difficulty in storing
perishables because her refrigerator was broken. He said she tried
to keep milk and eggs cold by placing them next to the window but
lived in fear that rats would get at them.

   Stock prices showed no clear trend today as
traders awaited new signs of the outlook for the economy and
interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 5.80 to 2,008.79
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers slightly outnumbered losers in the overall tally of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 654 up, 615 down and 482
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 52.26 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said traders were looking ahead to congressional
testimony Tuesday by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board.
   Several statistical reports are also due this week on such
subjects as durable goods orders, the consumer price index and
personal income and consumption.
   Of special interest to Wall Streeters is the Commerce
Department's revised figure for the gross national product in the
fourth quarter of last year, scheduled to be issued Thursday.
   The department earlier estimated GNP growth, after adjustment
for inflation, at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the October-December
period. Many analysts believe the new figure will be higher.
   Economists at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., for example, say
it is possible that the report will show growth of 5.5 percent or
more.
   Polaroid rose 1~ to 29] and Eastman Kodak dropped 1~ to 40].
Late Friday it was disclosed that Polaroid was seeking to recover
as much as $5.7 billion from Kodak in connection with violations of
instant-photography patents.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .12 to 146.84. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .03 at 280.19.

<HEAD>Holding Company Denies Merger, Acquisition Rumors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First RepublicBank Corp. ran full-page
advertisements in local newspapers today reiterating that it was
not involved in merger negotiations and blaming seasonal and
anticipated factors for its shrinking deposits.
   The advertisements seek to reassure depositors of Texas' largest
bank holding company, which has been plagued by huge losses
stemming from its portfolio of troubled loans.
   ``During the past few days, there have been several articles and
news stories about the current state of our bank,'' the ad stated.
``Many of the items reported in these articles have been misleading
and some just plain wrong. Consequently, we feel it necessary to
respond to these reports.''
   Since First RepublicBank reported a $656.8 million loss on Jan.
19, there have been questions about its ability to weather
anticipated losses from its $3.9 billion portfolio of troubled
loans.
   Speculation in the financial markets last week sent First
RepublicBank's common and preferred shares tumbling and helped
disrupt its system for raising deposits.
   On Sunday, First RepublicBank chairman Gerald W. Fronterhouse
issued a statement denying the reports. The company ``is not
involved in merger or acquisition discussions with anyone. Also, we
are not aware that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is
negotiating with any other parties regarding our company.''
   He said the FDIC had assured First RepublicBank ``that its
policy is to advise the institution before engaging in such
negotiations.''
   The advertisement addresses three points: merger rumors, deposit
safety and deposit activity.
   ``There have been several misleading newspaper stories
concerning our bank's recent deposit activity,'' the advertisement
stated.
   ``Through mid-February, the corporation's average total deposits
have only declined by approximately 4{ percent this year. More than
half of the reduction was an expected decline in foreign deposits,
with the balance due primarily to normal seasonal factors.''
   The bank represents only one-third of the corporation's total
deposits, Fronterhouse said.
   The letter encouraged First RepublicBank customers to call if
they had further questions.

<HEAD>Consumer Products Company Files In Bankruptcy Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Allegheny International Inc.
says the company will be stronger after it emerges from bankruptcy
reorganization because of the strength of its consumer products
business.
   Oliver S. Travers said two of Allegheny International's
subsidiaries, Sunbeam Corp. and Almet-Lawnlike Inc., are profitable
and would not have had to file for reorganization were it not for
the parent company's complex financial situation.
   He said that including Almet-Lawnlike, Sunbeam's net worth, or
assets minus liabilities, is about $400 million.
   ``Sunbeam is very healthy, as evidenced by its excellent results
for the first four months of this fiscal year and by its strong
backlog of orders,'' said Travers, chairman since 1986.
   The Pittsburgh-based holding company and some of its
subsidiaries, filed Saturday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for
protection from its creditors while it reorganizes. Also included
in the filing are Sunbeam Holdings Inc. and Chemetron Corp.
   Greg Drahuschak, analyst for Butcher & Singer, said the filing
announcement was ``no horrendous surprise.''
   ``It's probably the best operating move they had, given their
credit situation and the need they had for operating capital,'' he
said. ``This gets the banks off their backs for a while.
Unfortunately, the sacrificial lamb in this process is the common
shareholder.''
   Allegheny International said it has lined up fresh financing of
$175 million from two major New York banks, Travers said. The
credit line provides enough cash to run the companies during the
reorganization, he said.
   ``Chapter 11 provides the means to implement corporate
restructuring and continue the company's profitable turnaround,''
Travers said.
   The bankruptcy court petition was a key to getting the
additional money, said Chief Operating Officer Thomas Albani.
   While negotiations with the two banks occurred before the
filing, the financing was made afterward. Legally, that puts the
lenders in a ``superpriority'' position ahead of other creditors,
Albani said.
   The total liabilities of the company and its subsidiaries, which
include such items as payroll and accounts payable as well as bank
debt, are about $845 million. Its tangible assets are about $735
million.
   Total debt alone for the parent company and its subsidiaries
amounts to $525 million, of which $175 million is in short-term
bank loans and $350 million is in various long-term commitments.
   Allegheny International lost about $200 million from 1985 to
1987, largely due to debt incurred through a spree of acquisitions
in prior years as well as heavy losses in real estate, gas and oil
and credit operations.
   Under a new management team since Robert Buckley resigned under
pressure in 1986, the company has shed 19 subsidiaries and severely
cut its corporate overhead.
   The efforts bore fruit in the first quarter of fiscal 1988,
which ended Dec. 31, 1987, when the company posted a profit of
$7.25 million _ its first in two years.
   Profits from consumer products amounted to $31.5 million in the
quarter, compared with $19.2 million for the same period in 1986.
   The filing does not affect Sunbeam Corp.'s consumer products
operations in Canada, Mexico, Venezuela and Peru, according to the
company. It also does not affect industrial and high technology
companies that Allegheny International is in the process of
divesting.
   Allegheny International, prior to 1981, was known as Allegheny
Ludlum Industries. The company acquired Sunbeam Corp. that year for
$534 million.
   Consumer products manufactured by Sunbeam includes small
household appliances, electric blankets and barbeque grills.
Almet-Lawnlite manufactures lawn and patio furniture.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened mostly higher
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Long-range bullish attitudes prevailed in the grain and soybean
pits, and little selling pressure surfaced this morning after last
Friday's steep sell-off just before the close.
   ``Everybody that needed to get out got out on Friday,'' said
Victor Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``Now
they're all gunning again, coming back for more.''
   Supportive fundamentals included relatively light farmer selling
of grains over the weekend and dry weather in the soybean-growing
region of southern Brazil, Lespinasse said.
   In early trading, wheat was { cent lower to 1{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $3.22{ a bushel; corn was \
cent lower to 1} cents higher with March at $2.01 a bushel; oats
were } cent lower to \ cent higher with March at $1.91 a bushel;
soybeans were 1 cent to 3{ cents higher with March at $6.34 a
bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures mostly were higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .42 cent higher with April at
73.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .30 cent
higher with March at 83.35 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower
to .43 cent higher with April at 44.15 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .18 cent to .58 cent higher with February at 53.85
cents a pound.
   All livestock futures settled higher on Friday while frozen pork
bellies ended lower.

<HEAD>CFTC Probing Fraud Allegations Against 22 CBOT Traders: Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has
notified 22 traders at the Chicago Board of Trade that the CFTC
staff will recommend civil charges of prearranged and fraudulent
trading against them, according to a published report.
   But some of the traders involved say the trading technique in
question is practiced daily on many commodity exchanges and is not
prohibited by the exchanges' rules, the Wall Street Journal
reported in today's editions.
   Officials at the CFTC, the federal agency that regulates futures
exchanges, would neither confirm nor deny the report.
   ``The only enforcement action the commission will comment on is
a publicly filed complaint,'' said Kate Hathaway, a CFTC
spokeswoman.
   The case, reportedly involving trading at the world's biggest
market for U.S. Treasury bond futures, may be one of the largest
single instances of alleged futures trading violations.
   The Journal said the allegations concerned certain trades made
in the Board of Trade's huge Treasury bond futures pit in mid-1986.
The traders maintained that the type of trading being investigated
_ loosely known as a ``ginzie'' trade, where a customer gets two
different prices for portions of the same buy or sell order _ is
widespread on futures exchanges, the newspaper said.
   The CFTC notifications are part of a procedure designed to give
potential defendants a chance to argue to the commission that it
should not follow its staff's recommendations.
   The traders received the notices last Wednesday and Thrusday and
were given two weeks to respond with the written arguments to the
CFTC, the Journal reported.

<TEXT>
   The number of oil and gas rigs working in the
United States rose by 10 this week to total 978, Baker Hughes Inc.
announced Monday.
   This week's total reflects the number of rigs working as of last
Friday. A year ago the count was 839, Baker Hughes stated.
   The previous week, the rig count had dropped by 18 to total 968.
The rig count usually declines during the first few months of the
year.
   Houston-based Baker Hughes, an oil toolmaker, tallies the number
of rigs actively exploring for oil, and not rigs producing oil. The
rig count is the most widely-watched industry index of drilling
activity.
   Hughes Tool Co., which merged this year with Baker International
Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept track of the number of working
rigs since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the count
reached a peak with 4,500 active rigs. But in the summer of 1986,
the rig count fell to 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began compiling
figures _ as oil prices plunged to less than $10 per 42-gallon
barrel.
   Among the major oil producing states, Texas gained 12 rigs this
week, followed by Kansas, 10; Wyoming, three; North Dakota, two;
and Colorado, one.
   New Mexico posted the largest decrease, losing five. Ohio and
Oklahoma lost two each; Louisiana and Michigan lost one each.

<TEXT>
   Foodmaker Inc., the operator and
franchiser of Jack in the Box restaurants, will acquire Chi-Chi's
Inc., a 200-unit Mexican restaurant chain, in a leveraged buyout
for about $230 million, the companies announced Monday.
   Under the agreement, which has been approved by the boards of
both companies, Foodmaker will acquire Chi-Chi's in a $10.15 a
share tender offer. The sale was expected to be completed about
April 1.
   ``We believe it will be an excellent vehicle, along with the
Jack in the Box chain, for growth acceleration and to build
stockholder value,'' said Jack W. Goodall Jr., chairman and
president of Foodmakers.
   San Diego-based Foodmaker will finance the acquisition with
short-term loans from a group of banks led by Wells Fargo Bank NA,
Goodall said, but Foodmaker was confident Chi-Chi's cash flow would
be sufficient to fund the purchase.
   He also said Chi-Chi's headquarters would remain in Louisville
with its current management.
   ``We think this transaction, which is not conditioned upon
obtaining financing, is in the best interest of our stockholders,
and we are pleased that Foodmaker intends to continue the growth of
Chi-Chi's and maintain our headquarters in Louisville,'' said Hal
Smith, chairman and chief executive of Chi-Chi's.
   Chi-Chi's operates and franchises full-service Mexican
restuarants. For the six months ended Oct. 31, Chi-Chi's had net
income of $6.7 million on revenue of $144.5 million.
   Foodmaker Inc., operates and franchises more than 900 Jack in
the Box fast-food restaurants located mainly in the western and
southwestern United States.
   Foodmaker had net earnings of $13.9 million in 1987 on revenue
of $598 million.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rejects Appeal of California Investor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday rejected an appeal
by a California investor who said he lost $500,000 because of an
insider-trading scheme.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that excluded
John Olaques of Mill Valley, Calif., from receiving any money from
a $7.8 million settlement of the insider-trading case.
   The dispute stems from a proposed merger between Santa Fe
International Corp. and Kuwait Petroleum Co. in 1981.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission charged that some traders
in Santa Fe stock and options benefitted illegally from insider
information about the deal between Sept. 21 and Oct. 1, 1981.
   The defendants in the case agreed to surrender $7.8 million in
profits to some 1,900 investors. A federal judge approved the
settlement in 1986.
   Olaques challenged the settlement, arguing that he was excluded
improperly from recovering $500,000 in losses.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against him last
May. The appeals court upheld a judge's decision that Olaques did
not qualify for any money from the settlement because his
investment took place before the insider trading scheme occurred.
   The appeals court said Olaques was not entitled to intervene in
the settlement after it has been approved. He ``should not expect
to be able to stand aside and watch others incur the expenses of
lengthy litigation and then upset the results of those efforts,''
the appeals court said.
   Olaques said he was hurt by the insider-trading scheme even
though he purchased options on Sante Fe stock before Sept. 21,
1981. He said the options did not expire until Oct. 6, 1981.
   The case is Olaques vs. SEC, 87-769.

   The U.S. dollar fell Monday against all major
currencies except the Canadian dollar in listless European trading.
   Gold prices rose in Europe after slipping in Hong Kong.
   Dealers attributed the dollar's slide mainly to uncertainty over
the state of the U.S. economy.
   While recent reports that the U.S. trade deficit had narrowed
had supported the dollar, dealers said there were no new incentives
to keep it from falling.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7630 from $1.7505 late
Friday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to close at 129.95 Japanese yen from
130.53 yen on Friday. In later trading in London, the dollar
slipped to 129.27 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.6955 West German marks, down from 1.7075;
1.3930 Swiss francs, down from 1.3985; 5.7500 French francs, down

   In London, the metal rose to $446 a troy ounce from $442.90 late
Friday. In Zurich, gold rose to $446.50 from $443 late Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell to $447.12 an ounce from

<HEAD>Drexel Acknowledges SEC Staff Recommended Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
has acknowledged publicly that the staff of the Securities and
Exchange Commission has recommended that Drexel and some of its
employees face civil charges.
   The investment firm also confirmed it has been under
investigation by a federal grand jury.
   The information is contained in a preliminary prospectus for New
America High Income Fund Inc., a new high-yield ``junk bond'' fund
being Drexel is underwriting. Such information routinely is
required in prospectuses to warn would-be investors of potential
risk.
   The document describing the fund was dated Feb. 16 and mailed to
investors last week.
   It stated Drexel had advised the fund about the SEC staff
recomendations for civil actions against the firm and against some
employees ``relating to transactions, some of which may have
involved `high yield' bonds.''
   ``No assurance can be given that the results of any such SEC
action or grand jury investigation will not have an adverse effect
on Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and-or the market for `high yield'
bonds, a market in which Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is an
important participant,'' the prospectus said.
   Despite the caveat, sales of the fund apparently were unaffected
on Friday, its first trading day, when it closed unchanged at $10
per share.
   Steven S. Anreder, Drexel's chief spokesman, on Monday declined
to comment outside of the information contained in the prospectus.
   In January, Drexel and several ranking employees _ including
junk-bond chief Michael Milken _ reportedly were informed that the
SEC staff had decided to recommend charges of violations of
security laws.
   On Jan. 27, the Wall Street Journal said the focus of the SEC's
investigation of Drexel involved possible violations of securities
laws in corporate takeover situations, particularly ``stock
parking'' _ the hiding of true ownership of stock in someone else's
name. The practice can be used to evade SEC reporting requirements.
   Drexel and the employees have lodged their opposition to the
decision with the SEC, but the federal agency had not decided
whether to proceed, according to the prospectus.
   The firm previously has acknowledged that an investigation was
under way, but it has maintained that no wrongdoing took place.
   The prospectus says Drexel has furnished documents to a federal
grand jury in New York, and some employees have appeared before the
panel.
   Drexel reportedly has been the object of government scrutiny
since the breaking of the scandal surrounding former arbitrager
Ivan F. Boesky, because of the firm's extensive involvement in
financing of corporate takeovers involved in the scandal.

   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower
Monday after a late sell-off on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   A mixed opening was followed by firmer prices across the board,
but the gains did not hold up.
   The decline near the session's end was led by commission-house
selling of soybeans and soybean oil, said Victor Lespinasse, a
trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``The beans and oil were the two markets that really collapsed,
and that collapse pulled everything else down,'' he said.
   Soybean traders closely are watching the large Brazilian soybean
crop, which is nearly ready to harvest, Lespinasse said. Weather
conditions in Brazil will have an increasing impact on U.S. soybean
futures as the harvest gets under way.
   At the close, wheat was { cent lower to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.22{ a bushel; corn was 1 cent
to 2\ cents lower with March at $1.99{ a bushel; oats were
unchanged to 1 cent lower with March at $1.90} a bushel; soybeans
were 6{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with March at $6.27 a bushel.

<HEAD>Monsanto Selling AstroTurf Unit To German Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Monsanto Co., a pioneer in the development of
synthetic turf for sports fields, said Monday that it had sold its
AstroTurf Industries Inc. subsidiary to a West German company.
   Terms of the sale to Balsam Sportstattenbau GmbH & Co., K.G., of
Steinhagen, West Germany, were not disclosed. Astroturf Industries
will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Balsam and will remain
based in Dalton, Ga., a company spokesman said.
   Monsanto installed the world's first commercially-produced
synthetic turf playing surface in the Astrodome in Houston in 1966.
Since then, AstroTurf surfaces have been installed in hundreds of
sports stadiums and athletic fields around the world.
   Balsam has offered jobs to ``essentially all'' of the
businesses' 100 employees and will keep its management team intact,
Monsanto Group vice president Earl N. Brasfield said.
   Balsam is the multinational market leader and manufacturer of
sports and recreational surfaces, and has been serving as
Monsanto's European and Asia-Pacific distributor for AstroTurf
recreational surfaces. It also has other U.S.-based subsidiaries
that market and install indoor and outdoor sports floor systems.
   The agreement gives Balsam the rights to the AstroTurf
trademark, but Monsanto will continue using the trademark in its
doormat business.
   Monsanto spokesman Dan Bishop said the buyer asked that the
annual sales figure for AstroTurf not be released.
   But he said AstroTurf sales amounted to less than one-half of
one percent of Monsanto's annual sales. Monsanto had sales of $7.64
billion in 1987.
   Bishop said the sale was made because AstroTurf ``was not part
of our new strategy.'' The company's primary business is in fibers,
plants, resins and specialty chemicals.

   Stock prices pushed ahead today as traders
awaited new signs of the outlook for the economy and interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 13.92 to 2,028.51
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 3 to 2 in the overall
tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 918 up, 572
down and 474 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were looking ahead to congressional
testimony Tuesday by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal

   Several statistical reports are also due this week on such
subjects as durable goods orders, the consumer price index and
personal income and consumption.
   Of special interest to Wall Streeters is the Commerce
Department's revised figure for the gross national product in the

   The department earlier estimated GNP growth, after adjustment
for inflation, at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the October-December
period. Many analysts believe the new figure will be higher.
   Economists at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., for example, say
it is possible that the report will show growth of 5.5 percent or
more.
   Polaroid rose 2\ to 29} and Eastman Kodak dropped 1| to 40|.

<HEAD>High Court Upholds Limits on Local Cable TV Regulation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday upheld a ruling
that sharply curtails the power of communities to regulate cable
television, while raising doubts about the constitutionality of a
key federal law governing cable operations.
   Separately, the justices agreed to hear appeals by the Reagan
administration and coal mining companies trying to block the
possible award of billions of dollars in black lung disease
benefits to thousands of miners.
   In the cable television case, the high court cited a lack of
jurisdiction in turning away an appeal by Palo Alto and Atherton,
Calif., which were barred from enforcing public access and other
rules challenged by cable operator Century Federal Inc.
   But the court's action apparently was based on narrow procedural
grounds and leaves open the possibility of a subsequent appeal.
   U.S. District Judge Eugene F. Lynch ruled last September that
cable regulations adopted by the two California cities
unconstitutionally violated Century Federal's free-speech rights.
   The lower court had thrown out regulations requiring the
company, among other things, to wire the entire community to make
service available to all residents and to use a
``state-of-the-art'' system to keep pace with the latest
technological advances.
   Lynch, who previously had ordered city officials to award an
operating license to Century Federal, called for further hearings
to study franchise fee requirements adopted by the cities.
   Palo Alto and Atherton officials said the ruling appears to
declare unconstitutional a 1984 federal law regulating cable TV,
even though the judge did not say in so many words that he was
invalidating the law.
   The Reagan administration, in a ``friend-of-the-court'' legal
brief filed by Justice Department lawyers, urged the high court to
deny the cities' appeal.
   In the case involving black lung disease benefits, the high
court said it will review a ruling that the government must reopen
some previously rejected claims for benefits.
   The Reagan administration maintains the ruling by the 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, if extended nationwide, could force
officials to re-examine 94,000 claims at potentially tremendous
cost to the overburdened fund that pays benefits to miners
afflicted with the disease.
   The lower court had ruled last March that thousands of miners
seeking the benefits had been unfairly denied a hearing. The ruling
applied to miners with less than 10 years of work in the mines
whose claims were denied in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
   The appeals court said the U.S. Department of Labor must take a
fresh look at the claims under liberalized standards adopted by
Congress in 1977. The appeals court applied the ruling to miners
who failed to exhaust their administrative remedies or who missed
deadlines for filing court appeals.
   In other business-related action Monday, the Supreme Court:
   _Agreed to study a key affirmative action issue _ the power of
local governments to require minority participation in public works
projects. The justices will hear an appeal by Richmond, Va.,
officials seeking to revive a so-called set-aside program for
construction industry businesses owned by minorities.
   _Agreed to decide whether states may tax any income from oil and
natural gas extracted from the Outer Continental Shelf. The court
said it will hear an appeal by Shell Oil Co. challenging an Iowa
tax.
   _Agreed to decide whether a 5 percent tax Illinois imposes on
all telephone calls charged to in-state numbers interferes with
interstate commerce. GTE Sprint Communications Corp. is involved in
the suit.
   _Let stand a ruling that forces Ann Arbor, Mich., officials to
justify in federal court a zoning ordinance limiting where adult
bookstores may be opened for business.
   _Rejected an appeal by Mill Valley, Calif., investor John
Olaques who said he lost $500,000 because of an insider-trading
scheme. The court let stand a ruling excluding Olaques from
receiving any money from a $7.8 million settlement of the case,
which stems from a proposed merger between Santa Fe International
Corp. and Kuwait Petroleum Co. in 1981.

<HEAD>Midam, First Commodity Reach $3.51 Million Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The MidAmerica Commodity Exchange and First
Commodity Corp. of Boston have agreed to a $3.51 million settlement
ending all fraud litigation against First Commodity, the exchange
announced Monday.
   Under the agreement, $3.01 million will be paid directly to
defrauded customers, whose losses totaled more than $51 million in
1984, the exchange said in a news release.
   MidAm will retain First Commodity's $500,000 guarantee deposit
and the now-defunct firm waived all claim to those funds, the news
release stated.
   MidAmerica in 1986 found that First Commodity had violated
exchange rules through its use of promotional materials, fraudulent
and misleading sales practices and its withdrawal of guarantee
funds on deposit with the exchange.
   The exchange expelled the company and fined it $3.51 million.
First Commodity later went out of business.
   ``Plaintiffs in the class action applaud the MidAm's efforts and
contributions in helping settle the largest reported class action
commodity fraud settlement to date,'' said Marvin Miller, one of
the plaintiffs' Chicago attorneys.
   James Brooks, general counsel for First Commodity, could not be
reached to comment immediately on the settlement. An answering
service collected requests for comment from the defunct firm.
   ``The MidAm Board of Directors felt this settlement met all the
objectives of the exchange, the futures industry, and the needs of
defrauded investors,'' said MidAmerica President Thomas R. Donovan.
   The agreement stipulates that First Commodity will pay $3.01
million to a settlement fund to be administered by the federal
district court in Boston, where investor cases were consolidated.
   The fund will be used to compensate those investors for some of
their losses.
   The U.S. District Court ``has preliminarily approved a
settlement class of potentially defrauded FCCB customers eligible
for compensation. This settlement raises the amount in the fund to
a currently estimated $5.3 million,'' the exchange stated.
   William Murschel, an exchange spokesman, said he did not know
how many investors were involved, but the release said ``virtually
every FCCB customer lost money, most of them losing 50-90 percent
of their investments.
   ``Customer out-of-pocket losses in 1984 totaled in excess of $51
million, nearly $30 million of which went to FCCB in the form of
commissions,'' the exchange said.

<HEAD>Pan Am, Teamsters in Standoff; Some Agents Report Bookings Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp. and the union representing 4,500
ground employees in 14 cities remained in a stalemate Monday
following the breakup of their talks, and Teamster leaders vowed
``guerrilla war'' against the financially troubled airline.
   Travel agents reported that some customers have shunned Pan Am
flights as a result of the conflict, which was sparked after the
Teamsters' strike deadline passed at 12:01 a.m. Sunday.
   Talks in which management was seeking $35 million in concessions
from the union broke down Sunday afternoon.
   No negotiating sessions were held Monday. The union, which
represents reservation clerks and other ground staff, put off a
strike. But Teamster leaders threatened to use disruptive tactics
against Pan Am, which operates Pan American World Airways, a
Northeast corridor air shuttle and other services.
   Labor unrest also escalated at another major U.S. airline.
Flight attendants at Minneapolis-based Northwest Airlines have
voted overwhelmingly to strike this weekend if a contract dispute
over wages and benefits is not resolved, a union official said.
   Disclosure of the Northwest strike vote came as the two sides
readied to resume negotiations for the first time since last month.
   Sources close to Pan Am, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said they were pessimistic about the prospects for a negotiated
resolution of the conflict with the Teamsters.
   ``We can strike (Pan Am) any time we want,'' said William
Genoese, director of the Teamsters' airline division. ``We're going
to pick our strategic time.''
   In the meantime, Genoese said, ``there's guerrilla war at all
the airports. ... The passengers are really going to suffer in this
situation.'' He said the tactics would include deliberately
misdirecting baggage and cargo and canceling passengers'
reservations.
   Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said there was no evidence so
far of such disruptions.
   ``The operation is running smoothly,'' Hanlon said. ``There is
no evidence of any job action of any sort at any station.'' She
said ``nothing very dramatic'' had happened at John F. Kennedy
International Airport in New York City, Pan Am's major hub.
   The company has said it would maintain operations with
replacement workers in the event of a strike. The Transport Workers
Union at Pan Am voted Friday not to support a Teamsters' strike,
and pilots, flight attendants and flight engineers are not expected
to honor picket lines.
   ``There haven't been any problems whatsoever,'' said Archie
Lenzi, chairman of the Pan Am pilots union's Master Executive
Council, noting that he piloted a flight Sunday from San Francisco
to New York without incident.
   Not all travelers appear to be reassured, however.
   ``It's a very bad situation for everybody,'' said David Perlman,
president of DMS Travel in midtown Manhattan. ``Some people are
shying away (from Pan Am flights).''
   Perlman said his agency has been using double bookings as an
insurance technique for customers booked on Pan Am flights. For
passengers taking Pan Am from Kennedy airport to Europe on Monday
night, for example, he also booked them on flights offered by other
airlines to the same destinations.
   ``I think we have to go on the assumption that if there is a
strike, all (Pan Am) flights will be shut down,'' Perlman said.
   James Cammisa, a travel industry consultant, estimates that a
threatened strike against an airline generally reduces bookings for
the carrier by about 10 percent to 20 percent.
   ``Any kind of strike threat erodes bookings,'' Cammisa said,
noting that the same thing has happened with Eastern Airlines, a
subsidiary of giant Texas Air Corp. with a history of labor
troubles.
   ``The public is very concerned about the turmoil (Pan Am is)
having with their unions,'' said Steven Hoffenberg, chairman of
Towers Financial Corp. The loss of bookings resulting from the
conflict, he said, ``is going to be enough to drain the company and
put them into bankruptcy.''
   Towers, a debt-collection and insurance holding company based in
New York, has said it intends to launch a takeover bid for Pan Am,
with the Teamsters' backing. Towers owns about 100,000 Pan Am
shares, out of a total of around 139 million shares outstanding.
   Pan Am had a net loss last year of $265.3 million on revenue of
$2.9 billion, following a 1986 loss of $462.8 million on revenue of
$2.5 billion. The company recently signed agreements on more than
$330 million in concessions with the unions representing pilots,
flight engineers and flight attendants. Pan Am also went through a
major management shakeup a month ago: Its new chairman, Thomas G.
Plaskett, briefly headed Continental Airlines and also worked at
American Airlines.
   The Teamsters represent workers at airports in Boston, Detroit,
Chicago, Seattle, San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles, Honolulu,
Houston, Washington, New York and the Florida cities of Tampa,
Orlando and Miami. The vast majority of the workers are employed in
New York and Miami.

<HEAD>Holding Company Denies Merger, Acquisition Rumors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   First RepublicBank Corp. ran full-page
advertisements in local newspapers Monday blaming shrinking
deposits on seasonal factors and foreign withdrawals and repeating
denials that it was involved in merger or bailout negotiations.
   In an open letter to customers, First RepublicBank stated that
recent news reports on the financial condition of the state's
largest bank holding company were wrong or misleading.
   The advertisement was aimed at depositors, whom the company
feared might begin withdrawing funds due to the reports because of
concerns about deposit safety.
   ``During the past few days, there have been several articles and
news stories about the current state of our bank,'' the ad says.
``Many of the items reported in these articles have been misleading
and some just plain wrong. Consequently, we feel it necessary to
respond to these reports.''
   Since First RepublicBank reported a $656.8 million loss Jan. 19,
rumors have spread about its ability to weather anticipated losses
from its $3.9 billion portfolio of troubled loans.
   Speculation spread to financial markets last week, sending First
RepublicBank's common and preferred stocks tumbling and disrupting
its system for raising deposits.
   The bank said in a statement Sunday that 88 percent of its funds
come from core deposits, gathered through its system of 134
branches and subsidiary banks. At year's end, First Republic had
$1.93 billion in foreign deposits, representing about 7.5 percent
of its funds.
   Total deposits as of Dec. 31 were about $24.5 billion, according
to spokeswoman Martha Larsh. Assets totaled $33.2 billion, making
First RepublicBank the nation's 14th-largest bank holding company
at yearend 1987.
   First Republic stated it lost slightly more than $1.1 billion in
deposits since the end of 1987. First Republic Chairman Gerald
Fronterhouse said about half the withdrawals _ nearly $550 million
_ were at the lead Dallas bank.
   ``Through mid-February, the corporation's average total deposits
have only declined by approximately 4{ percent this year,'' the
company's ad said. ``More than half of the reduction was an
expected decline in foreign deposits, with the balance due
primarily to normal seasonal factors.''
   The Wall Street Journal reported in its Monday editions that
federal regulators were preparing a possible $4.5 billion rescue.
   Fronterhouse said in the statement issued Sunday that the
institution was unaware of any efforts by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. to arrange an assisted merger for the bank holding
company, the nation's 13th largest.
   ``Furthermore, that agency informed us that its policy is to
advise the institution before engaging in such negotiations,''
Fronterhouse said.
   An FDIC official said the agency ``would be less than
responsible'' if it didn't prepare contingency plans for a troubled
bank.
   First RepublicBank's ad also addressed the economic condition in
Texas, which leads the nation in bank failures.
   ``These are not the best of times for any of us in Texas. But we
are totally committed to serving your needs and contributing to
your success. We are here for the long term,'' read the letter
signed by Fronterhouse, Joseph Musolino and Charles Pistor, vice
chairmen.

<TEXT>
   The dollar drifted lower Monday against most
other currencies in listless trading that analysts said reflected
uncertainty about the outlook for the U.S. economy and interest
rates.
   Gold prices were narrowly mixed. Republic National Bank in New
York quoted a late bid for gold at $444.25 a troy ounce, down 75
cents from Friday's late bid.
   Traders looking for clues about whether the economy was
expanding or falling into a recession are focusing on reports due
later this week when the government makes its latest revised
estimate of fourth-quarter economic growth and issues reports on
consumer prices, income and spending in January.
   Marc Chandler, currency analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago, said the currency market was being pulled in opposite
directions.
   He said the market had been heartened by two consecutive monthly
declines in the U.S. trade deficit, which could indicate the
Federal Reserve may not have to encourage lower interest rates to
assure continued progress in reducing the imbalance.
   But Chandler said dollar traders remain concerned that the trade
deficit still was too large for comfort. He said there has been
speculation that European central banks sold dollars last week,
inhibiting the currency's rise, in an effort to maintain stable
foreign exchange rates.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 129.95 Japanese yen from 130.53 yen
on Friday. In later trading in London, the dollar slipped to 129.27
yen. In New York, the dollar fell to 129.35 yen from 130.05 yen
Friday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7630 from $1.7505 late
Friday. The pound finished at $1.75925 in New York, up from $1.7495
last Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Friday, included: 1.69785 West German marks, down from 1.7080;
1.39275 Swiss francs, down from 1.3980; 5.7410 French francs, down
from 5.7755; 1,249.50 Italian lire, down from 1,256.75; and 1.27225
Canadian dollars, down from 1.2737.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Friday,
included: 1.6955 West German marks, down from 1.7075; 1.3930 Swiss
francs, down from 1.3985; 5.7500 French francs, down from 5.7675;
1.9040 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9150; 1,252.25 Italian lire,
down from 1,257.75, and 1.2738 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2702.
   Gold prices edged up in Europe but slipped in New York and Hong
Kong.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery fell
20 cents a troy ounce to $444.90 from $445.10 last Friday.
   In London, gold rose to $446 an ounce from $442.90 late Friday.
In Zurich, gold rose to $446.50 an ounce from $443 late Friday.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell to $447.12 an ounce from $447.51
Saturday.
   Silver bullion rose in London to $6.41 a troy ounce from $6.37
late Friday. Later on New York's Comex, silver for current delivery
edged up 1.5 cents an ounce to $6.40.

<HEAD>Wisconsin Wins Supercomputer Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAU CLAIRE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A supercomputer company announced Monday
it would keep its home in Wisconsin, less than a month after
Chrysler Corp. announced its plans to close an auto plant in the
state with 5,500 workers.
   The decision by Supercomputer Systems Inc. ended a battle with
neighboring Illinois to attract the company, which is developing
fast, high-powered computers.
   The company was started by Steve Chen in Eau Claire after he
left Cray Research Inc. in September.
   The state of Wisconsin will help Supercomputing Systems to
secure $25 million in private loans. The city of Eau Claire will
provide a $27 million incentive package by selling a building at a
reduced cost, applying for development grants and helping raise
money to secure other loans.
   Chen's announcement came after the Eau Claire City Council voted
unanimously Monday to offer a $25 million backup aid plan if
problems arise with the state's share of the package.
   Chrysler announced Jan. 27 its plans to halt Kenosha auto
production by Sept. 30. State and local officials have accused the
company of breaking an oral promise to keep the plant open for five
years, but company officials have said they made no such promise.
   The city was concerned about offering incentives after
witnessing the Kenosha problems, but decided the situation was
entirely different, said Wallace Rogers, Eau Claire city council
president.
   ``You don't get an opportunity, especially in this part of the
country, to attract a large business, especially this
state-of-the-art company, too often,'' Rogers said.

<HEAD>Rio Grande Files Application To Acquire Southern Pacific</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rio Grande Industries Inc. on Monday filed an
application with the Interstate Commerce Commission to acquire
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. for $1 billion from Santa Fe
Southern Pacific Corp.
   Rio Grande said in a news release that if the acquisition was
made, it planned to sell a 25 percent share in the merged railroads
to a limited partnership affiliated with the investment firm Morgan
Stanley Group Inc.
   The ICC already has approved an expedited schedule for the
application, with a final decision expected in six months, Rio
Grande said.
   The application follows a formal purchase agreement that Rio
Grande entered into with Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. Last year,
the ICC ordered Santa Fe Southern to divest either the Southern
Pacific or the Santa Fe Railroad.
   Rio Grande's action will affect Kansas City Southern Industries
Inc.'s rival bid of more than $1.25 billion for the Southern
Pacific, said Joele Frank of Adams & Rinehart in New York, which
handles KCSI's public relations.
   ``Kansas City is planning to ask the ICC to choose which company
should acquire the Southern Pacific, based on which would serve the
public interest the best,'' she said. ``They will ask that the ICC
consider whether the bidder helps the competition, and also is
willing to pay a higher price.''
   Ms. Frank said KCSI should be aided in the ICC deliberations by
having the higher offer.
   Rio Grande officials equally were confident their proposal would
win ICC approval.
   ``We are confident that the commission will find this
single-line system covering both the southern and central rail
corridors will enhance competition for the benefit of shippers and
the public,'' said William Holtman, Rio Grande chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Tom Saunders, chairman of the equity fund, said: ``The financial
commitment we are making is the strongest statement possible about
our confidence in the long-term viability of this venture.''
   The two lines will be an end-to-end joining of railroads whose
common points at Ogden, Utah, Herrington, Kan., and Kansas City,
Mo., will allow complete connection of the two systems, Rio Grande
said.
   Rio Grande's proposal has been accompanied by a commitment to
honor existing labor contracts. The railroad also said it has
received the unanimous support of the general chairmen of all the
unions representing Southern Pacific workers.
   Roy Thiessen, vice president of marketing and sales for the
Denver and Rio Grande Western, said shippers have expressed support
for the merger as well.
   ``It is clear that the public and customers are anxious to see
this acquisition approved promptly, without delays caused by third
parties,'' said Thiessen.

   The stock market chalked up another broad gain
Monday, extending its recent rally in a mood of increasing optimism
about the economic outlook.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 25.70 to
2,040.29, hitting a new six-week high for the third straight
session.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 2 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,160 up, 432 down and 423 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 178.93 million shares, against 180.30
million in the previous session.
   Analysts said traders were looking ahead to congressional
testimony Tuesday by Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board.
   Several statistical reports are also due this week on such
subjects as durable goods orders, the consumer price index and
personal income and consumption.
   Of special interest to Wall Streeters is the Commerce
Department's revised figure for the gross national product in the
fourth quarter of last year, scheduled to be issued Thursday.
   The department earlier estimated GNP growth, after adjustment
for inflation, at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the October-December
period. Many analysts believe the new figure will be higher.
   Economists at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co., for example, say
it is possible that the report will show growth of 5.5 percent or
more.
   While such news might not be especially favorable for
interest-rate prospects, brokers said, it would tend to support
recent arguments that the economy has not been dealt a severe
setback by the market crash last October.
   Polaroid rose 2{ to 30 and Eastman Kodak dropped 1{ to 40}. Late
Friday it was disclosed that Polaroid was seeking to recover as
much as $5.7 billion from Kodak in connection with violations of
instant-photography patents.
   Among other actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines gained 1~ to 115\; Exxon | to 43]; American Telephone &
Telegraph ] to 29~, and General Electric 1} to 45.
   Manufacturers Hanover jumped 2\ to 25} in buying fueled by
takeover rumors and speculation. The company said it had no
knowledge of any potential bid to acquire it.
   Other money-center bank issues posted fractional gains. Chase
Manhattan rose } to 24; Chemical New York ] to 23|, and J.P. Morgan
~ to 37\.
   Allegheny International dropped { to 2~ for a loss of 14.8
percent. Over the weekend the company filed for protection under
Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $33.07 billion, or
1.29 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 2.00 to 148.96.
   Nationwide turnover in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 203.55 million shares.
   Standard & Poor's index of 400 industrials rose 4.86 to 306.34,

<HEAD>Henley Proposes Santa Fe Scrap Part of Restructuring, Sell It More
Stock</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Southern Pacific</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA JOLLA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dissident investor Henley Group Inc.
proposed Monday that Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. scrap part of
its financial restructuring and instead sell $780 million in new
stock to Henley.
   The move, which would boost Henley's stake in Chicago-based
Santa Fe to 34.3 percent from 15.7 percent, was expected to receive
a cool reaction from Santa Fe, which has been fending off Henley's
unwanted overtures since mid-1987.
   Santa Fe spokesman Robert Gehrt said the proposal would be taken
up at Santa Fe's regularly scheduled board meeting Tuesday. He
added there might be a comment after that.
   Henley's proposal calls for Santa Fe to stop the planned payment
of $5 per share in high-yield ``junk bonds'' for each of its 157.3
million shares on March 1. Santa Fe already has made a
$25-per-share cash payout.
   Henley has claimed persistently that the pay-in-kind debentures
would leave shareholders with a large tax liability because of the
way they are structured.
   Instead, Henley proposed that Santa Fe sell Henley $780 million
worth of new stock at $17.50 per share. Proceeds from that deal
would be used to make a onetime $5-per-share cash payout to all
current shareholders.
   The proposed deal would mean 44.6 million new shares for Henley
and would boost Santa Fe's total shares outstanding to 201.9
million.
   Henley now owns 24.6 million shares, or 15.7 percent, of Santa
Fe, a railroad, land and natural resources concern.
   But Henley conditioned its proposal on Santa Fe voiding its
current ``poison pill'' takeover defense that would be triggered if
any holder's stake exceeds 20 percent.
   If any hostile suitor exceeds that limit, other Santa Fe
shareholders would be permitted to buy new stock at half price.
   Henley repeatedly has criticized Santa Fe's adoption of the
``poison pill'' last December, saying it restricted the ability of
major holders such as itself and Toronto-based real estate concern
Olympia & York Developments Ltd. to maneuver.
   In a setback for Henley, Santa Fe earlier this month gave two
seats on its board to officials of Olympia & York. In exchange,
Olympia & York agreed to support Santa Fe's restructuring plans.
   However, in mid-February Olympia & York launched a surprise
tender offer to boost its holdings in Santa Fe to 19.9 percent from
its current 10.5 percent.
   Olympia & York's action has caused speculation that the Canadian
company still intends to push for break-up of Santa Fe as a means
of increasing the company's value.

<HEAD>Stock-Index Futures Hit Highest Level Since Oct. 19</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock-index futures overcame selling resistance Monday to settle
at their highest values since the Oct. 19 stock market collapse.
   On other markets, cotton futures collapsed; grains and soybeans
were mostly lower; livestock and meat were mixed; precious metals
were mixed; and energy futures were lower.
   The contract for March delivery of the Standard & Poor's 500
stock index gained 3.90 points to settle at 266.85 on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, topping the previous post-collapse high of 264
points set Jan. 5.
   The March contract had rallied above the psychologicially
important 264-point barrier earlier in the session only to fall
back. But the second surge inspired broad-based follow-through
buying that continued until the close, indicating the market had
potential to move even higher, said Abbe Cocuzza, stock-index
strategist for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Ms. Cocuzza speculated the next point of resistance was 274
points, the level at which the March S&P 500 contract opened on
Oct. 19 after hitting a low of 280.40 in the previous session.
   Cotton futures prices collapsed on the New York Cotton Exchange
in a sell-off linked to the impending expiration of the March
contract.
   Tuesday marks the first notice day for the March cotton
contract. Traders holding ``long,'' or buy, positions rushed to
liquidate those positions to avoid the possibility of being locked
into agreements to take physical delivery of cotton on the
contract's March 9 expiration date, analysts said.
   The sharp decline in the March contract's price touched off
computerized sell programs that drove prices on the three near-term
contracts down the daily limit and sent prices on other contracts
to new life-of-contract lows, said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist
for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The contract for March delivery of cotton settled at 60.40 cents
a pound, down the 2-cent limit.
   Grain and soybean futures finished mostly lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   A mixed opening was followed by firmer prices across the board,
but the gains did not hold as commission houses became heavy
sellers of soybeans and soybean oil near the close, said Victor
Lespinasse, a trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``The beans and oil were the two markets that really collapsed,
and that collapse pulled everything else down,'' he said.
   Wheat settled } cent lower to 1\ cents higher with March at
$3.22\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2\ cents lower with March at
$1.99\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent lower with March at
$1.90} a bushel; soybeans were 6{ cents lower to 3 cents higher
with March at $6.27\ a bushel.
   Cattle futures declined while pork futures rose on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Profit-taking and hedge selling pressured the
cattle contracts, and the pork complex rallied on
better-than-expected cash prices, analysts said.
   Live cattle were .15 cent to .75 cent lower with April at 72.80
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to 1.03 cents lower with
March at 82.52 cents a pound; hogs were .12 cent to .33 cent lower
with April at 44.05 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.10
cents lower to .35 cent higher with February at 54.02 cents a pound.
   Gold retreated slightly while silver gained a bit in light
trading on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold settled 20 cents to 80 cents lower with April at $447.60 a
troy ounce; silver was 1 cent higher across the board with March at
$6.41 a troy ounce.
   Oil prices edged lower after fluctuating in a narrow range. Some
analysts cited reports of overproduction and other problems within
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that could point
to bigger oil supplies.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 8 cents to 25 cent
lower with March at $16.62 a barrel; heating oil was .01 cent to
.56 cent lower with March at 45.79 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .05 cent to .25 cent lower with March at 46.32 cents a
gallon.

   Wells Fargo & Co. has reached a formal
agreement on its proposed acquisition of Barclays Bank of
California for $125.7 million in cash, the two banking companies
said Monday.
   Wells Fargo said the proposed acquisition, announced more than
five weeks ago and subject to approval of federal regulators, is
expected to be completed during late spring.
   The purchase should have ``minimal, if any, dilution on earnings
per share in 1988 and will make a positive contribution to earnings
per share in 1989,'' the company said in a press release.
   Wells Fargo's stock rose $1.62{ a share to $51.62{ Monday on the
New York Stock Exchange. Barclays stock closed unchanged at $32.62{.
   Barclays Bank of California, a subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC
and the 17th largest bank in the state, had year-end assets of
approximately $1.3 billion. It operates 50 branch offices, has
about 1,100 employees and will continue to maintain corporate
offices in both San Francisco and Los Angeles.
   San Francisco-based Wells Fargo is the parent company of Wells
Fargo Bank, third largest bank in California and ninth biggest in
the nation. It had year-end assets of $44.2 billion.
   The deal continues Wells Fargo's aggressive retail expansion
across California.

<HEAD>Arco Alaska Plans To Spend More Than $7 Billion In Alaska Over 10
Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atlantic Richfield Co.'s Alaska
subsidiary said Monday it is prepared to invest more than $7
billion in the oil-rich state over the next 10 years if petroleum
prices and tax policies are stable.
   About $3 billion would go toward development of known reserves,
Arco Alaska Inc. President Bill Wade told the Anchorage Chamber of
Commerce. Spending of the rest would depend on the discovery of new
oil fields, including any reserves under the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge if Congress allows exploration there.
   ``To accomplish all of this will require reasonable oil prices
and a stable tax policy,'' Wade said.
   The plan assumes prices in the $20-per-barrel range for a few
years, followed by increases in the mid-1990s, said Arco Alaska
spokeswoman Susan Andrews.
   She said Arco has not asked for any changes in Alaska's tax
structure and does not plan to in the near future.
   Arco Alaska operates half the giant Prudhoe Bay oil field, which
along with other North Slope oil fields supplies 20 percent of the
nation's domestic oil.

   The dollar fell to the lowest trading level in two

foreign banks.
   The U.S. currency opened at 129.27 yen, down 0.68 yen from
Monday's close of 129.95, and was quoted at between 128.85 and

<HEAD>Announces Introduction of New Soft Drink</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Seven-Up Co. will introduce an amber colored
soft drink labeled 7-Up Gold designed to reach young adults,
company officials said Monday.
   The company is characterizing the new product as ``the wild side
of 7-Up,'' a natural spice flavored soft drink sweetened with
aspartame.
   ``7-Up Gold is the missing link in the 7-Up family,'' said John
R. Albers, chief executive officer of the company, a subsidiary of
the Dallas-based investment group Hicks & Haas.
   Company officials said they are trying to reach a mostly male
18- to 34-year-old market with the new drink. The company also will
introduce a Diet 7-Up Gold.
   Russ Klein, senior vice president of marketing, said that while
the image of 7-Up is clean-cut and conservative, 7-Up Gold is aimed
at mainstream soft drink consumers who generally drink colas.
   But like all 7-Up products, it will be ``light, refreshing,
thirst quenching, crisp, natural and translucent,'' Klein said.
   Shipments of the new drink will begin in April, in time for the
spring and summer seasons, with national distribution expected by
the end of May, officials said. The company will spend more than
$10 million in advertising for the drink this spring and summer,
Klein said.
   The new drink follows the introduction of Cherry 7-Up and Diet
Cherry 7-Up last year. Those drinks have captured 1.7 percent of
the lucrative soft drink market.
   Albers said 7-Up Gold now gives the company ``the most complete,
competitive line-up'' in the soft drink industry.
