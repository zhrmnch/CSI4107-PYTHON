   President Kurt Waldheim acknowledged
Thursday that he had considered resigning, and canceled his
scheduled speech at the main ceremony on the 50th anniversary of
the day Adolf Hitler annexed Austria.
   He said he would address the nation on television instead.
Leading politicians have said a speech by Waldheim, who concealed
his Germany army service and has been accused of war crimes, was
not the way to lead national reflection on atrocities of the Nazi
past.
   The speech on March 11, the day of the Nazi ``anschluss'' in
1938, was decided upon last month as a means of avoiding a
political showdown over whether to invite the 69-year-old president
to address a joint session of Parliament on that day.
   During an interview late Thursday on Austrian state television,
Waldheim was asked if he had considered quitting before his term
ends in 1992.
   ``Naturally I thought of it,'' he said. ``Otherwise I wouldn`t
be a human being. I'd have to be a piece of wood.''
   He again rejected the notion of resigning, which has been
suggested or demanded from all political quarters.
   ``That would only make things worse,'' Waldheim said, adding
that he has a ``clear conscience'' about his past. He was elected
in June 1986 to a six-year term.
   Austria is governed by a coalition of the Socialists, led by
Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, and the conservative People's Party,
which backed Waldheim for president in the 1986 election. People's
Party leader Alois Mock, who is deputy chancellor and foreign
minister, is among his fervent supporters.
   Accusations arose during the presidential campaign about
Waldheim's service as a German army lieutenant in the Balkans, and
the United States put the former U.N. secretary-general on a
``watch list'' of undesirable aliens last year.
   In September, at Waldheim's request, Vranitzky's government
appointed an international panel of historians to investigate his
wartime activities. It concluded in a report this month that he
knew atrocities were being committed in ``close proximity'' to him
and did nothing to stop them, and left the question of personal
guilt open.
   In an interview broadcast Thursday evening on state radio,
Waldheim said he felt the president should promote reconciliation,
and ``it was a result of this feeling of my duty as federal
president that I took this personal initiative'' not to speak.
   Asked whether it was ``painful'' for him to cancel the speech,
Waldheim responded: ``It wasn't very painful, since I will be
present at the ceremony.''
   Waldheim's office said in a statement earlier Thursday: ``In the
interest of efforts aimed at a harmonious remembrance ceremony, the
president will not speak at this event.'' The statement did not
specify a day for the televised address, but Mock said later that
Waldheim would deliver it on March 10, the day before the ceremony.
   His office said Waldheim would attend the unveiling of a plaque
honoring members of Austria's prewar parliament who were victims of
the Nazis. The statement added that he hopes to promote the
``peaceful development of our nation.''
   Leaders of the anti-Waldheim movement had said thousands of
protesters would mass outside the Hofburg Palace, former seat of
the Hapsburg emperors, if Waldheim spoke at the anniversary
ceremony. It is to be held in the palace, which houses the
presidential offices.
   Organizers of the program, including Vranitzky, met with
Waldheim on Thursday to discuss his participation.

   Former Prime Minister Mamdouh Salem died
Thursday in London while undergoing treatment from an undisclosed
illness. He was 70.
   The state-run Middle East News Agency said Salem would be given
a military funeral Sunday in Cairo.
   The agency said President Hosni Mubarak praised Salem, saying
Egypt would remember him for his ``nationalism, his good manners,
his self-respect and sacrifices for the majority interest and
good.''
   Salem was prime minister from 1975 to 1978. When then-Foreign
Minister Ibrahim Kamel resigned in 1978 to protest the signing of
the U.S.-sponsored Camp David accords between Egypt and Israel,
late President Anwar Sadat appointed a new government. The peace
treaty was signed a year later.
   Salem was a personal aide to Sadat and to Mubarak, who succeeded
Sadat in 1981.
   Born in 1918 in the Mediterranean port of Alexandria, Salem was
governor of Asiut, Gharbiya and Alexandria from 1967 to 1971, when
he was appointed interior minister.

   A federal judge Thursday upheld the National
Collegiate Athletic Association's drug-testing program, ruling
against a student athlete who contended the taking of urine samples
violated her privacy.
   U.S. District Judge Walter McGovern said any violation of
privacy is outweighed by the NCAA's interest in protecting
students' health, reducing drug use and ensuring fair competition.
   The American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the suit on
behalf of University of Washington runner Betsy O'Halloran and
another athlete who later joined the case, will probably appeal,
said the ACLU's Kathleen Taylor.
   Under NCAA rules, students must sign a consent form before the
regular season begins allowing random testing.
   The testing does not actually occur until post-season playoff
time, but students like Ms. O'Halloran who refuse to sign are
prohibited from regular-season competition.
   Ms. O'Halloran, a cross-country and track athlete, had sued the
university over its mandatory testing program, but last month UW
revised its program so that screening was voluntary and required
only of athletes suspected of drug use.
   The claim against the university was then dismissed, with the
claim against the NCAA program and the university's participation
in it remaining.
   However, UW athletes are still required to sign an NCAA consent
form.
   Ms. O'Halloran had asked McGovern to grant her a preliminary
injunction allowing her to compete for the UW women's track team
this spring.
   But McGovern denied the request, saying any harm done to her by
being barred from competition was outweighed by the potentially
greater harm to the NCAA.
   ``Competent athletes might use banned drugs in violation of NCAA
rules, and the public interest in fair competition without the use
of drugs would not be served,'' McGovern said.
   Ms. O'Halloran has not been able to compete during the fall
cross-country season and will not participate in track this spring
because she will not sign the consent form, Ms. Taylor said.
   Ms. Taylor said the ACLU was surprised by the decision,
especially in light of a Feb. 11 federal appeals court decision
prohibiting drug testing of railway workers without specific
suspicion against a particular individual.
   ``The NCAA's laudable goal of reducing drug use among student
athletes must be carried out in a less degrading and intrusive
manner,'' Ms. Taylor said.

<TEXT>
   More than President Hosni Mubarak's efforts
to bring peace to the Middle East, Egyptians are talking these days
about shortages of cooking oil and sugar. It's angry talk.
   Cooking oil and sugar are important items on the Egyptian menu,
used extensively by peasants who make up half the nation's 51
million people.
   Cooking oil is added to beans, which are eaten at breakfast and
dinner, and used to fry vegetables, especially eggplant and
potatoes, the usual peasant lunch.
   As for sugar, Egyptians consume so much in tea, pastries and
candy that the Health Ministry has begun a television campaign in
an effort to persuade people that more than six lumps a day is
harmful.
   The shortages have been assailed in the news media and heatedly
discussed in coffee shops.
   The subject has come up in the Shura Council, a government body
of experts in various fields who give advice to Mubarak and to the
People's Assembly, the national legislature.
   And in the People's Assembly itself, Prime Minister Atef Sedki
was taken to task because of his Cabinet ministers had denied that
the shortages exist. Sedki admitted they were not being entirely
candid, but he assured the assembly that Egypt once again will get
by.
   Food shortages are nothing new to Egypt. The country must import
60 percent of what it eats and it doesn't have the money to pay for
all it needs. In addition, it increasingly has more mouths than it
can feed, as the population explodes at a rate of 1 million every
nine months.
   That coupled with stagnant food production has transformed the
country from the food exporter it was three decades ago to the
importer it is today. The nation, facing a foreign debt of $44
billion, doesn't have the money to pay for it all.
   Nobody has a ready solution. Increasing food production isn't
easy because only about 4 percent of the country's land area, the
Nile River Valley, is fertile, and little money is available to
reclaim and cultivate the desert.
   Egypt is among the world's biggest producers of cotton, which is
the source of most cooking oil used in the country, but it must
import more than 80 percent of its needs _ at a cost of $250
million a year.
   ``We import 500,000 tons of cooking oil, at the cost of $500 a
ton,'' said Rifaat Saadawy, an official in charge of oil imports at
the Industry Ministry.
   ``So the cooking oil crisis is connected with the foreign
exchange crisis, and any shortage in foreign currency means a
shortage of providing cooking oil for local consumption.''
   Similarily, despite expanses of sugar cane in central Egypt, the
country's farmers produce only about half the nation's needs,
forcing imports of 700,000 tons for almost $158 million last year.
   A further complication is that many stable foods are distributed
through expensive subsidy and ration systems. Under pressure from
the International Monetary Fund and at the urging of the United
States, the government has been trying to reduce the subsidy
systems' burden on the national Treasury.
   For the past two years, it has tapered off the number of
subsidized items available at government stores or purchased with
ration cards from private markets. But the items taken off the list
cost much more.
   Despite the cutbacks, the government spent $2.2 billion in the
1986-87 fiscal year on subsidies for food and other items. That's
only $675 million less than the subsidy bill in 1983-84 and remains
much higher than levels Washington and the IMF want.
   The government does not want to eliminate or sharply reduce
subsidies because it fears a recurrence of food riots in which more
than 70 people were killed in 1977.
   For peasants like Nawal Mohamedein, who lives at el-Faronia, 30
miles north of Cairo, the system is not working.
   ``The official price of a one-kilogram (2.2-pound) bottle of oil
was 80 piasters (36 cents,) but now it is not available in the
shops,'' she said. ``I buy it off the black market for 3.5 pounds
($1.60) a bottle. It has limited our food to next to nothing.''
   She said she now has to serve bread and cheese for the midday
meal in place of the usual eggplant and potatoes.

   Jazz legend Lionel Hampton announced that a
$20,000 grant the National Endowment for the Arts is giving to a
foundation under his control will be channeled to a music school
named in his honor.
   Hampton spoke Wednesday to the Moscow Chamber of Commerce while
visiting the Panhandle college town to headline the University of
Idaho's jazz festival and receive an honorary degree.
   ``I always enjoy coming out here because this is a place where
high school students, college students, professional people and
educators and jazz musicians can come together in a common cause to
listen and improve the great art we foster,'' Hampton said.
   Dozens of the world's top jazz performers have come out of
Hampton's bands. But he said he has gotten the most pleasure from
having the university's Lionel Hampton School of Music named after
him, which he said is ``like going to heaven.''
   Hampton started his career in the 1920s. When he joined Benny
Goodman's quartet in 1936, he broke a color barrier that had kept
black musicians out of American entertainment's front ranks.

   ``Wheel of Fortune'' host Pat Sajak says that
just because CBS is giving him a talk show opposite NBC's ``Tonight
Show'' doesn't mean he's taking on Johnny Carson.
   ``If you're going to do a late-night show, that's a fact of
life, that Mr. Carson is going to be there. We can't worry about
that. We have to worry about doing the best show we can,'' Sajak
said at a news conference Wednesday.
   CBS Entertainment President Kim LeMasters confirmed plans for
the show, which he said would be 90 minutes compared with Carson's
hour and would debut next January.
   ``There is no attempt on our part here to compete with Johnny
Carson,'' LeMasters said. ``Mr. Carson is a tradition, he is
much-beloved and a brilliant performer in what he does, and that's
not our aim. Our aim is that the environment in late night can
stand more than just one talk-show format.''
   Sajak will continue indefinitely as host of the nighttime
version of ``Wheel of Fortune,'' the nation's No. 1 syndicated
show. His contract for the NBC daytime version of the show expires
in December.

   Hugh Hefner's former live-in girlfriend upped
the ante in her ``palimony'' suit against the Playboy magazine
publisher, saying she now wants $35 million to prevent him from
ruining other young lives.
   Celebrity divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson filed an amended
complaint Wednesday for Carrie Leigh adding fraud and deceit to her
previous accusations that Hefner abandoned promises to support and
father her child.
   Hefner attorney Anthony Michael Glassman said the fraud and
deceit claims were unfounded. He called the lawsuit revision a
publicity stunt.
   Miss Leigh's suit now seeks $20 million in punitive damages ``to
dissuade him from maintaining his long-enjoyed practice of seducing
teen-age girls, supporting them for a few years and then discarding
them.''
   The initial complaint filed Feb. 11 in Superior Court sought an
estimated $5 million-plus, but the amendment adds the punitive
amount and says lost career earnings and benefits amount to $15
million. Miss Leigh, 24, claims she gave up a modeling career in
1983 to serve as a companion at the Playboy Mansion to Hefner, 61.
   Mitchelson said the relationship ended with the arrival at the
mansion of Jessica Hahn, whose sexual encounter with PTL minister
Jim Bakker led to the evangelist's fall from grace.

   The government's ban on
political activity by opposition organizations was the most
extensive crackdown in 10 years. Here is a chronology of previous
efforts to restrict political opposition:
   1955 _ A national Peoples Congress was broken up and 156 black
leaders, including Nelson Mandela of the African National Congress
, and Pan-Africanist Congress leader Zeph Mothopeng were charged
with treason. All were acquitted after lengthy trials.
   March 21, 1960 _ The ANC and PAC called for peaceful protests
against laws requiring blacks to have passes to enter white areas.
Police gunfire killed 69 blacks at a rally in the Sharpeville
township.
   March 30, 1960 _ National state of emergency was declared,
granting police wide powers to prohibit gatherings, search people
and premises, and resort to force. New powers of detention without
trial were introduced and after the emergency ended, many of the
new powers became law.
   April 1960 _ Parliament outlawed the ANC and PAC.
   1961-62 _ ANC and PAC military wings were formed and a sabotage
campaign began.
   Aug. 5, 1962 _ Nelson Mandela was arrested and, in 1964,
sentenced to life in prison for treason and sabotage.
   June 16, 1976 _ An estimated 13,000 black students demonstrated
in Soweto to protest a requirement that lessons be taught in the
Afrikaans language. Police killed several students, touching off
riots and boycotts that sweep South Africa for more than a year,
claiming 575 lives by official count.
   Sept. 12, 1977 _ Steve Biko, founder of the Black Consciousness
movement, died in police detention.
   Oct. 19, 1977 _ Government banned 18 organizations plus the two
largest black newspapers, and detained 47 black leaders.
   May 1978 _ The Azanian People Organization was formed to replace
the Black Consciousness organizations banned after Biko's death.
   Aug. 20, 1983 _ The United Democratic Front was launched to
organize opposition to a planned tri-cameral parliament including
representation for all race groups except the black majority. Over
the next four years, the UDF became the largest legal
anti-apartheid group.
   September 1983 _ Riots broke out in Sharpeville, touching off
three years of widespread violence claiming 2,500 black lives.
   Feb. 19, 1985 _ Police began arresting UDF leaders on treason
charges. More than 22 were arrested.
   July 20, 1985 _ President P.W. Botha declared a state of
emergency in 36 black cities and towns, the first such declaration
since 1960. The emergency decrees covered about half the country.
In the first week, 1,000 activists were detained.
   December 1985 _ The Congress of South African Trade Unions was
formed to consolidate labor and political activity of black unions.
   March 7, 1986 _ The government lifted the state of emergency,
saying conditions have improved.
   June 4, 1986 _ The government banned all meetings related to
10th anniversary of Soweto riots.
   June 12, 1986 _ More than 1,000 anti-apartheid activists were
detained in pre-dawn raids. Botha imposed a nationwide state of
emergency, with broad press curbs, wide powers for police and
restrictions on many forms of protests and statements. An estimated
30,000 people were detained.
   Oct. 9, 1986 _ Government banned the UDF from receiving funds
from outside the country.
   Nov. 7, 1986 _ New orders were issued restricting activities of
white opponents, prohibiting them from participating in certain
organizations, publishing statements or attending rallies.
   December 1986 _ The press was banned from reporting many
anti-government statements or being within sight of protest
activity.
   May 6, 1987 _ The headquarters of Congress of South African
Trade Unions was blown up on election day. The Conservative Party
made big gains, becoming the official parliamentary opposition on
campaign against any apartheid reform.
   August 1987 _ National Union of Mineworkers, COSATU affiliate,
staged the most costly strike in country's history.
   Aug. 27, 1987 _ New curbs were announced to suppress
anti-government press, by threatening shutdown or in-house censors.
Seven newspapers were warned about articles government considers
objectionable.
   October 1987 _ Universities were told that funds will be cut if
they don't stop campus protests. ANC leader Govan Mbeki was
released after 24 years in prison.
   December 1987 _ The government restricted Mbeki to Port
Elizabeth, banning him from talking to press or addressing rallies.
   Feb. 24, 1988 _ The government banned political activity of 18

   A quake stronger than the Oct. 1 temblor that
caused severe damage in Los Angeles is likely to occur east of the
Rockies in the next two decades, so buildings in the area should be
fortified, experts said.
   The prediction is based on the history and geology of the
region, said Robert Ketter, director of the National Center for
Earthquake Engineering Research at the State University of New York
at Buffalo.
   The California quake, which killed eight people and measured 5.9
on the Richter scale, left an estimated $358 million in destruction
in the Los Angeles area, damaging more than 10,400 buildings and
leaving about 2,200 people homeless.
   ``I feel comfortable there will be a magnitude of 6 or higher
within the next 20 years'' somewhere in the United States east of
the Rocky Mountain foothills, said Ketter.
   Ketter, who called the California quake relatively modest, spoke
Wednesday during a break in a conference on earthquake hazards and
construction design in the United States east of the Rockies.
   Despite the low probability of a serious quake in any one place
east of the Rockies, the region's relatively dense population and
older buildings make for a ``very serious problem'' in risk from
earthquakes, he said.
   Robert Whitman, a civil engineering professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called Ketter's prediction
reasonable.
   The last major quake east of the Rockies struck Charleston,
S.C., in 1886, reaching an estimated Richter reading of 7 and
making itself felt as far away as Chicago, conference organizers
say. Other damaging quakes hit New York City in 1884, Anna, Ohio,
in 1937, western Tennessee in 1843 and Giles County, Va., in 1897.
   The most severe earthquakes in the nation's history struck New
Madrid, Mo., in 1811 and 1812, Ketter said. Having an estimated
magnitude of 8.3 to 8.5 on the Richter scale, the quakes were
strong enough to ring church bells in Washington, D.C., Ketter said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.
   An earthquake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage in the
local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6 severe
damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.
   Earthquakes east of the Rockies result from pressure exerted by
the floor of the Atlantic Ocean acting on geological areas of
weakness, speakers at the conference said. Because of geology,
Ketter said, an earthquake of a given strength can shake an area
100 times larger in this region than on the West Coast.
   ``We cannot rule out the possibility of a very large earthquake
occuring practically anywhere'' in the region, said Whitman, who
called on architects and engineers to encourage
earthquake-resistant construction.
   Cities and states should adopt the earthquake provisions of
model building codes, he said. Studies suggest that quake-resistant
designs add only about 1 percent to the cost of most new buildings,
he said.
   The more important challenge is what should be done to make
existing buildings more quake-resistant, he said. While it would be
politically difficult to require upgrading to meet the standards of
new construction, he said, steps short of that would be acceptable.
   Substantial upgradings of masonry buildings have been done for
$5 to $6 per square foot in Los Angeles and $5 to $10 per square
foot elsewhere, he said. For buildings with other types of
construction, upgrading can cost $10 to $20 per square foot, he
said.
   The conference is sponsored by Ketter's institute and the New
York Academy of Sciences, and co-sponsored by the National Science
Foundation and the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute, a
professional society for earthquake engineering.

   Robert Packwood, U.S. senator and fugitive
from a quorum call, thought he was safe, hiding behind a locked
door in his Senate office.
   But Henry Giugni, Senate sergeant-at-arms and former vice and
motorcycle cop, knew he would get his man.
   ``I had to take him in,'' he explained.
   ``I thoughtI was safe,'' Packwood recalled. ``But it's the
little things that trip you up.''
   It was as unlikely a scene _ and a night _ as could be recalled
by Senate historians, parliamentarians and press corps observers.
   It was the night, as Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., put it, where
``the entire Republican Party in the United States Senate ...
vanished into the night.''
   It was the night Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
wanted to keep the Senate in session through dawn's early light to
draw attention to a Republican filibuster that previously had been
quietly played out during daytime hours off and on over many months.
   If the Republicans didn't want a vote on a campaign finance
bill, they would have to keep talking. Republicans didn't want to
keep talking, so they attempted to keep a quorum off the Senate
floor, forcing the Senate to quit for the night.
   They huddled in the cloakroom outside the chamber.
   Then Byrd got tough. He asked for a vote directing the
sergeant-at-arms to ``reques attendance of absent senators.''
   The Republicans were so requested.
   But they stayed behind the cloakroom door.
   Byrd upped the ante.
   He asked that the Senate approve a motion to instruct the
sergeant-at-arms to ``arrest the absent senators and bring them to
the chamber.''
   With 45 Democratic votes, the motion carried.
   And the chase was on.
   Kerry said the sergeant-at-arms' orders resulted in ``a lot of
senators running off into the corridors at night,'' chased by
Giugni and a team of five plainclothes detectives.
   Giugni spotted Idaho Republicans Steve Symms and James McClure
down in a basement corridor where Symms has a ``hideaway'' office.
   At about the same moment, Symms and McClure spotted the
sergeant-at-arms.
   ``We took off. Henry was alone,'' Symms said. He fled down the
corridor.
   ``I didn't want to be the first one caught,'' he said.
   McClure's press secretary, H.D. Palmer, said his boss ``blew out
of there. He was a fugitive from Bobby Byrd's chain gang.''
   Giugni's position was a tough one. He works for the senators in
a capitol where senators' wishes are law. ``I had to do my job ...
I had a list. I went into the hideaways, then the Russell
Building'' where some senators have their offices.
   Giugni got lucky.
   Packwood had just holed up in his office. ``I thought I was
safe, I had been forewarned by my staff that Henry was going around
looking,'' Packwood recalled. After all, he was locked behind a
bolted door, and senators locked behind bolted doors in their
well-guarded office buildings are usually very, very safe.
   Packwood forgot the cleaning lady had seen him enter his office.
   And Giugni, five years on the Honolulu police force under his
ample belt, remembered to ask.
   Moments later, Giugni and his gang of five, armed with a
passkey, threw themselves at another door as the Oregon senator was
trying to slam and bolt it shut.
   ``There were three of them on one side. Their mass beat my
mass,'' Packwood said.
   Giugni was diplomatic. ``It was a misunderstanding. I thought we
were helping him open the door,'' he later joked, Packwood at his
side.
   The senator was hauled out of his office, across the Capitol,
put in an elevator, and, finally, physically picked up and
deposited feet first into the Senate chamber.
   Once there, Giugni had his man and the Senate had its reluctant
quorum of 51 senators.
   The arrest warrant carried with it indignities, but no penalties.
   But Packwood wasn't taking any chances.
   ``I'm asking Gerald Ford for a pardon.''

<HEAD>Report Calls For Emphasis On Fighting AIDS Among Drug Users</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of President Reagan's AIDS
commission is drawing praise from one of the administration's more
vocal congressional critics for his first round of recommendations
on combating the deadly disease.
   The praise came after retired Navy Adm. James D. Watkins,
promoted to the helm of the struggling commission last September,
said Wednesday the federal government should spend an additional $1
billion a year to fight AIDS among intravenous drug abusers alone.
   Approval of such an ambitious undertaking would virtually double
the $1.3 billion Reagan has requested for all Public Health Service
spending on AIDS in fiscal 1989 _ including research and prevention
measures aimed at the entire population.
   ``Admiral Watkins has compiled a first-rate set of
recommendations that begin to deal with the AIDS epidemic
responsibly and in detail,'' said Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif.,
who has been frequent critic of the administration during his
health subcommittee's 19 hearings on AIDS.
   ``I hope that President Reagan will attend to these
recommendations of his commission and will amend his budget and
come to the Congress to support them and the spending they
require,''' said Waxman.
   Watkins, who said he was making his recommendations to the full
commission public at the same time he sent them to the White House,
acknowledged that his call for sharply higher federal spending
might be less than well received at the Office of Management and
Budget.
   But he said there is no doubt AIDS is spreading most rapidly
among the nation's estimated 1.3 million intravenous drug abusers,
and their sexual partners, and that efforts to stem the disease
must concentrate on them.
   He expessed confidence the commission will adopt his
recommendations _ which also call on state and local governments to
increase their drug program spending by about $1 billion a year _
and formally pass them to the White House in early March.
   ``It is not in our charter to worry about the political
impact,'' said Watkins.
   A final report is due at the White House June 24 and Watkins
promised it will get into such controversial areas as AIDS testing.
The panel would be ``at loggerheads with ourselves'' if it tried to
deal with them without further testimony and deliberation, he said.
   Watkins also made a number of recommendations in the health care
area, including more training for doctors and federal backing for
home care for dying AIDS patients who may not require full-time
hospitalization.
   ``Many physicians are severely lacking in knowledge about AIDS
and there are signs that medical schools have not yet built up a
curriculum to educate doctors about AIDS treatment,'' Watkins said.
   He also cited a growing nursing shortage, saying an additional
500,000 nurses will be needed throughout the health care system by
1991.
   The report called for more financial support for the Food and
Drug Administration as well.
   Asked his reaction to the possibility of presidential
candidates, particularly Democrats, using his recommendations to
``zing the White House'' for not doing more earlier, Watkins
replied:
   ``How do you avoid politicizing something in an election year?
If they all adopt this and say `Let's get on with it,' that's the
kind of politicization I like.''

<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In 1988 as in 1980, it is proving difficult to
keep the plight of American hostages abroad from becoming an issue
in the presidential campaign.
   President Reagan's spokesman has rebuked Democratic hopeful
Michael Dukakis for bringing it up, but the record shows that
Reagan was not shy about criticizing Jimmy Carter on the same issue
in his own campaign eight years ago.
   The matter cropped up again Wednesday when Republican aspirant
Pat Robertson said his Christian Broadcasting Network once knew the
whereabouts of American hostages in Lebanon ``and they could have
been freed.''
   Reagan, in the nearest thing yet to a rebuke of any of the GOP
hopefuls, asked at his news conference Wednesday night, ``Isn't it
strange that no one in our administration was ever apprised of
that?''
   ``If he thought that he knew, he kept it to himself,'' the
president said.
   Two days earlier Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis was criticized by
Reagan spokesman Marlin Fitzwater for bringing the issue up while
talking to reporters after a governors' meeting at the White House.
   Dukakis said the administration needed a ``much tougher
anti-terrorism policy.'' He said, ``you can never, ever, make
concessions to terrorists. That's what we did in 1985 (in the Iran
arms sale initiative) and it hurt us very badly.''
   Said Fitzwater: ``It's very dangerous to make terrorism a
political issue, especially when you're talking about specific
episodes. As we have learned, as indeed the nation has learned, in
the last several years of experience, there are any number of
aspects to individual hostage-takings that can be exacerbated by
political talk or media talk or political statements. I would
simply urge caution on everyone's part, including political
candidates.''
   On Jan. 7, 1980, however, while campaigning for the GOP
presidential nomination in the New Hampshire primary, Reagan said
Carter's response to the taking of American hostages in Iran was
``too sluggish.''
   ``I believe it's appropriate to suggest that anything that has
been done by the administration so far, could have, should have,
been done in the first hour,'' Reagan said. He said the United
States should have ordered an economic boycott and set a deadline
beyond which the boycotted country could not go without serious
harm to itself.
   And on Oct. 28, 1980, only a few days before the election,
Reagan said in a debate with Carter in Cleveland that it was ``high
time that the civilized countries of the world made it plain that
there is no room worldwide for terrorism. There will be no
negotiation with terrorists of any kind.''
   When asked what specific ideas he had, however, Reagan said only
that he did have some but did not want to inject them into the
campaign for fear of endangering the hostages. He said there should
be a congressional investigation after the hostages were released.
   On the weekend before election day, after receiving Iranian
proposals that he said appeared to ``offer a positive basis'' for a
solution, Carter canceled campaign appearances and flew back to
Washington. ``We are within two days of an important national
election,'' he said. ``Let me assure you that my decisions on this
crucial matter will not be affected by the calendar.''
   Earlier, however, Carter had aroused skepticism about his
motives when he made an announcement regarding another abortive
Iranian overture on the morning of his crucial Wisconsin primary
battle against Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.
   In the end, the hostages were released on inauguration day in
January, 1981, and Reagan, by agreement with Carter, made no
mention of it in his inaugural address because the plane carrying
them to freedom had not yet cleared Iranian air space.
   Politics aside, Reagan's desire to get the hostages out of
Lebanon, like Carter's dedication to freeing the hostages from
Iran, is clearly an overriding concern.
   In words that echoed many of his previous statements _ and for
that matter some of Carter's _ the president said Wednesday night
that ``it's very frustrating to try and establish a location,
knowing of course that you are governed by the fact that unwise
action on our part could bring about harm to the hostages. But
we've never let up, and we never will, in trying to obtain the
freedom of all the hostages.''

<TEXT>
   The government's crackdown on
militant black political groups is intended to reassure
ultraconservative whites and convince blacks that tough opposition
tactics will not work.
   The government on Wednesday banned political activity by 18
opposition groups, including South Africa's largest anti-apartheid
organization and its biggest union federation. It was the most
sweeping crackdown in a decade.
   Organizations affected by the ban have been unwavering in their
rejection of President P.W. Botha's efforts to install cooperative
black local officials and to draw moderate blacks into
power-sharing negotiations aimed at preserving white political
power.
   Now the groups cannot, for example, campaign for black-majority
rule or organize a boycott of black municipal elections planned for
October.
   ``Every single peaceful action we can take has now been
criminalized,'' said the Rev. Allan Boesak, a co-founder of the
United Democratic Front, a coalition of more than 600 groups.
   The front, with more than 2 million members the largest black
political organization, and 16 other groups are forbidden from any
activity except bookkeeping and court action.
   Boesak said the restrictions were part of a bid ``to lure a
certain section of the black community into the government camp''
before the municipal elections.
   He said the government ``wanted to create conditions in which,
with no boycott, it would appear that its plans and its candidates
had generally been accepted.''
   By imposing the regulations a week before two parliamentary
by-elections, Botha also appeared to be trying to blunt criticism
from the extreme-right Conservative Party.
   The Conservatives are favored to win both contests over
candidates from Botha's National Party and have campaigned on a
platform accusing the government of caving in to black pressure.
   On Wednesday, the Conservatives complained that the
restrictions, which anti-apartheid groups termed a ``declaration of
war,'' were not enough.
   The restrictions follow a series of tough government statements
and actions against politically hostile neighboring countries.
Among those actions are South Africa's military intervention in the
Angolan civil war and threats of ``hot pursuit'' raids into
Zimbabwe against guerrillas who cross the border to stage attacks
in South Africa.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu on Wednesday said the
regulations were ``a vicious and provocative act by a government
which has become a serious threat to southern Africa.''
   ``Where do we go from here?'' asked the Black Sash civil rights
group in a statement. ``Into absolute totalitarianism, with the
government and its right wing competing for the spoils.''
   If the ban proves effective, the ranks of opposition groups
could be thinned drastically. Among the survivors, for the moment,
are white-led groups such as the Black Sash and church-related
groups such as the South African Council of Churches.
   The government's orders allow the militant Congress of South
African Trade Unions, the main black labor federation, to remain in
operation but bar it from political activity. The general-secretary
of the congress, Jay Naidoo, said the regulations, plus pending
legislation to curtail strikes, would be tantamount to an outright
ban of the group's existence.
   Inkatha, with 1.5 million members the second-largest black
political group after the United Democratic Front, was not affected
by the new regulations. The president of the organization, Zulu
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, considers himself a foe of apartheid
but opposes the militant strategies espoused by the front.
   More than 400 people have been killed in the past year in a
power struggle between the front and Inkatha in Natal province.
Several United Democratic Front leaders involved in efforts to
begin peace talks were served with notices Wednesday barring them
from further work with their organization.
   A.S. Chetty, one of those front officials, said: ``It definitely
puts the peace process in the doldrums.''
   Buthelezi had no immediate comment on the restrictions, which
may neutralize the front, its archrival, but may also suggest to
some blacks that the government doesn't view him as a threat.
   Under South Africa's system of apartheid, the country's 26
million blacks have no voice in national affairs, and the 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate schools and
districts.

<HEAD>Memos: Meese Backed Plan to Give Israel Secret Pentagon Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Edwin Meese III supported a
plan to make secret payments from the Pentagon budget to Israel to
protect a $1 billion Iraqi pipeline project being promoted by his
longtime friend E. Robert Wallach, according to memos outlined in a
published report today.
   The Washington Post reported that it had obtained memos written
by Wallach outlining the plan devised in late 1985 after other
attempts to ensure the safety of the pipeline project had failed.
The Wallach memos say that Meese supported the plan and that the
late CIA Director William Casey endorsed it.
   ``The idea was it was to come out of the defense budget on an
installment basis,'' the Post quoted one informed source as saying.
``It was, effectively, to be a payment to the Israelis to be good''
and not bomb or otherwise damage the Iraqi pipeline.
   Former National Security Adviser William P. Clark characterized
the plan as ``a protection racket'' when he was consulted about it
late in 1985, the Post said. On Clark's recommendation, newly
installed National Security Adviser John Poindexter reportedly
blocked the plan, the Post said.
   Meese's involvement with the pipeline project is the subject of
a criminal investigation by independent counsel James McKay.
   Responding to the latest disclosures, one of Meese's lawyers
rejected suggestions that the attorney general had endorsed a
Pentagon payout plan.
   ``It's ridiculous. The whole thing is ridiculous,'' James Rocap
said. ``This is a pipe dream, not only of Bob Wallach, but of the
press. We have a lot of people who don't like Mr. Meese.''
   President Reagan's personal approval would have been required
for Pentagon payments to have been made, but Reagan apparently was
never told of the proposal, the Post reported.
   Reagan told a news conference Wednesday night that he knows
little of any aspect of the pipeline project.
   ``I have no recall of knowing anything about this pipeline plan
until fairly recently,'' Reagan said. If ``I was given information
earlier ... I have totally forgotten it. I have no knowledge of
anything of that kind.''
   Wallach, a lawyer, had been hired to promote the pipeline
project. In a Dec. 12, 1985 telegram to Swiss oilman Bruce
Rappaport, one of the project's partners, he described the plan to
ensure the pipeline's safety as ``the capital DOD (Department of
Defense) package'' and said it ``appears to be in place,''
according to the Post.
   Wallach said in the telegram that the plan had been submitted
that day by David Wigg, a staff aide at the National Security
Council, to departing National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane.
   In another memo, Wallach reported to Rappaport about a meeting
with Casey.
   ``The meeting with your golfing partner lasted 45 minutes,''
Wallach said in what the Post said was a reference to Casey. ``Only
D.W. (David Wigg) and I were with him. I had met with D.W. for
breakfast and reviewed the DOD documents.''
   In a reference to Meese, Wallach said that ``my friend'' would,
if necessary engage a new person from the National Security Council
on the project.
   Meese's lawyers have said that the attorney general had only a
passive role in the project which consisted of referring Wallach
and then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres to McFarlane.
   Another Wallach memo to Meese that is the focal point of McKay's
probe mentions planned payments to the Israeli Labor Party out of
some $650 million to $700 million that was to be paid to Israel
over 10 years for non-interference with the Iraqi pipeline, which
was never built.
   McKay is trying to determine whether the planned payments to the
Israeli Labor Party amounted to a bribery scheme which Meese should
have stepped in to stop. The attorney general has said he doesn't
recall reading the reference in the memo to Labor Party payment
plans. The investigation centers around whether Meese violated the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
   At the news conference, Reagan said of Meese:
   ``I have every confidence in his integrity. I have known him for
more than 20 years.''
   Reagan also defended the ethical performance of his
administration generally, saying that ``those that were doing
something wrong and were apprehended ... they're no longer with
us.''
   The president said that in the case of former Cabinet officers
such as former Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan, all were cleared of
wrongdoing after lengthy criminal investigations and indictment.
   ``A kind of lynch mob atmosphere ... takes place, but no
attention is paid to the fact that'' many of them are ``found to be
totally innocent,'' Reagan said. Donovan was found innocent of
fraud in connection with charges that he and seven other
businessmen stole $7.4 million in a New York subway project.
   Reagan was asked whether the issue of ethics in the Reagan
administration would be used effectively by the Democrats in the
1988 campaign.
   ``I don't know whether they're going to be used effectively or
not,'' said Reagan. ``I know they're going to be used.''

   President Reagan and Portuguese Prime Minister
Anibal Cavaco Silva have agreed to a broad review of their nations'
military, economic and cultural relationship, which is being
buffeted by what Reagan calls ``harsh budget realities.''
   After a two-hour White House meeting on Wednesday, the
Portuguese leader said that because of declining U.S. assistance,
he wanted consultations on the relations, as provided in a 1983
cooperation agreement.
   He assured Reagan that ``We do not have the intention of ceasing
or reducing the facilities enjoyed by the United States in
Portuguese territory.'' The goal is to ``identify and overcome
existing difficulties,'' he said.
   At issue is how much assistance the United States is providing
Portugal in return for base rights, notably at Lajes Air Base _ a
major refueling point in the Azores Islands.
   In the 1983 agreement, the United States promised its ``best
efforts'' to keep aid at the highest levels and granted Portugal
$205 million the following year. Since then assistance has
declined, hitting $117 million this year.
   This did not meet what Cavaco Silva called ``the legitimate
Portuguese expectations,'' causing hardship for the NATO country as
it tries to modernize its armed forces.
   Cavaco Silva told guests at an embassy reception Wednesday night
that the 1983 agreement permits either consultations between the
two countries or a revision of the pact.
   As of now, Portugal is asking only for the consultations, but
``it may lead to a revision of the agreement,'' he said.
   He said Portuguese leaders understand the U.S. need to reduce
the budget deficit. The Portuguese people, however, don't
understnad why the United States is not paying Portugal the money
that was promised, he said.
   ``This is affecting in a negative way public opinion in
Portugal,'' he said.
   Reagan has asked Congress for $163 million in the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1 and officials have said chances are good the
request will be met _ given informal consultations with Congress
before the budget was submitted.
   But Reagan gave no assurances to Cavaco Silva, said a senior
administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Asked what the consultations requested by Cavaco Silva would
entail, the official said, ``What we are talking about today was
the whole of this relationship, and we'll sit down and see what
might be available in economic, science, cultural and educational
areas that would add to it.''
   Reagan, who called his talks with Cavaco Silva ``cordial and
candid,'' said, ``Portugal's role as a key and trusted ally is much
appreciated here. We applaud Portugal's desire to modernize its
armed forces, and to play a more active role in NATO's collective
defense efforts.
   ``Our commitment to assist Portugal in these efforts remains
firm, ever within the context of the harsh budget realities that we
all face.''
   Under the terms of the defense pact, which expires in 1991,
Portugal has the right to ask for a midterm review, the form of
which is not precisely spelled out.
   Earlier this month, in an effort to soothe Portuguese worries
about the aid cuts, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci went to
Lisbon and reached agreement with Portugal's defense chief to
substitute surplus U.S. military equipment for some of the aid lost
in the U.S. budget cutbacks.
   Talks are to begin soon to identify the military needs that
might be filled with U.S. aid.
   Since Carlucci's visit, however, several Portuguese leaders have
said the surplus equipment promise did not satisfy their
requirements, and Cavaco Silva's comments at the White House
reflected that dissatisfaction.

<HEAD>460 Americans May Get AIDS Infections Annually From Screened Blood</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who receive transfusions face a one in
40,000 chance of receiving AIDS-tainted blood despite screening
intended to keep the blood supply clean, according to a federal
study published today.
   The researchers emphasize that despite this ``remote but real
risk,'' people who need transfusions should not be deterred from
receiving them.
   ``The blood supply is relatively safe, dramatically safer than
it was before we had any screening,'' said the chief author of the
report, Dr. John W. Ward of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta.
   According to the estimate, published in the New England Journal
of Medicine, up to 460 Americans may get AIDS infections each year
from transfusions of tainted blood that slip through blood bank
screening programs. By comparison, 7,200 people are thought to have
gotten the virus from transfusions in 1984, the year before
screening began.
   The screening tests check blood for antibodies that the body
makes in an unsuccessful effort to fight off the AIDS virus.
However, in the first few weeks after an AIDS infection, antibody
levels are very low or absent. As a result, blood given during this
period appears to be safe, even though it contains HIV, the AIDS
virus.
   The CDC researchers believe that most infected blood that gets
through the screening program is donated during recent infections
before antibodies have developed.
   ``The report doesn't surprise me at all. It's just what people
predicted would happen,'' said Dr. Margot Kruskall, director of the
blood bank at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital.
   In an accompanying editorial in the journal, Dr. Thomas F. Zuck
of the University of Cincinnati Medical Center wrote, ``Although
continued vigilance over the safety of the blood supply is
essential, the risk of HIV transmission by transfusion should be
kept in perspective.''
   He noted that the odds of dying from influenza are one in 5,000,
while the risk of dying during a legal abortion after the 14th week
of pregnancy is one in 5,900. The annual risk of dying in a car
accident is one in 5,000.
   The CDC report described the cases of seven AIDS-infected donors
whose blood was not spotted by the standard AIDS screening test,
which checks blood for AIDS antibodies.
   Thirteen people became infected after receiving blood from these
men and women. One of them subsequently developed acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   The doctors said that about 60 percent of those infected from
transfusions die of the diseases for which they are being treated.
   ``This doesn't mean the blood supply is not being adequately
protected, but it means we may be able to make a good system
better,'' said Ward.
   New, more sensitive screening tests are becoming available. Ward
said they should be evaluated to see if they can shorten the period
during which newly infected people have undetectable AIDS
antibodies.
   Homosexual men and others at high risk of AIDS infection are
asked not to donate blood. To help reduce the risk of blood
contamination even further, it's important to find more effective
ways of discouraging such people from giving blood, Ward said.
   Among the infected donors uncovered by the study were a
homosexual man who wanted to learn whether he was infected and a
bisexual man who said he felt pressured to give blood at work.
   In general, blood banks discourage donations by any man who has
had a homosexual encounter since 1977; needle drug abusers and
their sexual partners; female sexual partners of bisexual men;
immigrants from Haiti or central African countries; men who have
had sex with prostitutes since 1977; and hemophiliacs.

Compensation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Life boats, exposure suits and other safety
equipment would be mandatory aboard most U.S. commercial fishing
vessels under legislation approved by a House committee.
   The safety provisions were passed Wednesday by the House
Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee despite objections from the
Reagan administration, which says voluntary programs are preferable.
   But lawmakers delayed a vote on setting compensation rates for
injured seamen, a provision that sunk the legislative package two
years ago.
   Under the measure drafted by Rep. Gerry E. Studds, D-Mass., most
commercial fishing boat operators would have to ensure that their
vessels have life boats, exposure suits for all crew members,
navigation and communication equipment, emergency beacons and first
aid kits.
   New vessels that carry more than 16 people also may be required
to install radar devices and face minimum requirements for
insulation material, fuel, ventilation and electrical systems.
   Civil penalties would include fines of up to $5,000. Criminal
penalties for willful violators would carry penalties of up to
$5,000 in fines and one year in prison.
   Two years after enactment, the Transportation Department would
be required to submit legislation to license commercial fishing
boat operators.
   Similar legislation that combined the boating safety
requirements with an injury compensation provision was killed in
1986 on a 241-181 House vote following a lobbying blitz by the
Association of Trial Lawyers.
   Members of that group commonly represent plaintiffs in lawsuits,
and they objected to set limits on the amount of compensation that
could be obtained for injuries.

<TEXT>
   George Bush, shoring up support in his
summer-home state as Republicans prepare for weekend caucuses here,
is looking for a strong win to bolster his campaign after losses in
Minnesota and South Dakota.
   Michael Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, was also playing
up his home-court advantage as the Democrats geared up for their
caucuses.
   Bush, who greeted supporters during a half-hour stop at the
Portland airport on Wednesday, said he was disappointed but not
surprised by his weak finishes in Minnesota and South Dakota.
   He bypassed campaigning in the two states in the face of the
strength of rivals Bob Dole and Pat Robertson.
   ``I think the result was somewhat anticipated,'' the vice
president said. ``You can't win them all.''
   Bush, who has a summer home in Kennebunkport, is heavily favored
to win Maine's Republican caucuses, most of which are being held
this weekend, although he said he was taking nothing for granted.
   ``I think we have to do our best. The same is true for all these
southern states,'' Bush said, referring to delegate-rich Super
Tuesday contests of March 8.
   Among Maine Democrats, Dukakis is widely viewed as the
front-runner. Dukakis, who split victories with Rep. Richard
Gephardt in Minnesota and South Dakota on Tuesday, spoke at a party
dinner in Bangor last weekend, and aides said he tentatively
planned to campaign in southern Maine on Sunday.
   ``We're looking to win, period,'' said David Villarino, the
Maine campaign manager for Dukakis, adding that the biggest concern
was turning out supporters at the caucuses.
   ``We're not perceiving a lot of excitement'' among party
members, he said.
   Campaign workers for the other candidates in both parties played
up expectations of Bush and Dukakis victories this weekend.
   They forecast battles for second and third place between Dole
and Robertson in the GOP caucuses and between Democrats Gephardt
and Jesse Jackson.
   A leader of Dole's Maine campaign, state Sen. Pamela Cahill of
Woolwich, said she was optimistic about Dole's prospects but did
not expect him to win in the state.
   Jeff Nelson, who was brought in from Michigan to serve as
Robertson's press secretary in Maine, predicted a battle for second
place between Dole and Robertson, although he suggested his
candidate is stronger.
   The Dole forces are ``struggling for second, we're struggling
for first,'' Nelson said.
   On the Democratic side, a Gephardt spokesman saw no prospect of
defeating Dukakis in ``his own front yard.'' Dukakis showed his
strength in the region with a decisive win in last week's New
Hampshire primary.
   ``The Massachusetts government is up here,'' said Jim Case. ``I
don't know if you'd call it a government in exile or a government
on leave.''
   Jackson spokesman Bob Philbrook also cited ``overwhelming''
support in the state for Dukakis but said the campaign was buoyed
by Jackson's showing in Minnesota, where he claimed 20 percent of
the vote, placing second to Dukakis.
   ``We're going to do better than that in Maine,'' Philbrook said.

   The 40 finalists in a competition to select
the top young scientists in the country say they spent an average
of 18 hours a week studying and no hours watching television for
entertainment.
   The finalists in the 47th Science Talent Search, a prestigious
national competition for high school seniors, said in a survey
released Wednesday that they each read an average of about 40 books
a year outside of school. Forty-five percent said they spent five
hours a week reading newspapers and 47.5 percent said they watched
five hours weekly of network and local television.
   None, however, reported watching any television for
entertainment.
   But despite their scholarly dedication, two-thirds of the group
still believe the high school years should include some
extra-curricular activities such as dances and football games.
   ``I feel that students will go crazy without some social
diversions,'' said Scott D. Zucker, 17, a student from South
Plantation High School in Plantation, Fla.
   Only about 16 percent of the group thought football and proms
could be dropped from high schools.
   ``The curriculum is far too often subordinated to social and
sports events,'' said David A. Cooke, 17, the Midland Park, N.J.,
high school valedictorian. ``Schools are designed to educate.''
   According to most studies, the 18 hours a week spent by students
in the group is far above the national average. A 1980 federal
study showed only 25 percent of U.S. high school students spent
more than five hours a week on homework. And a recent American
Council on Education survey of 250,000 college freshmen showed only
7.1 percent spent 16 or more hours a week in high school on
homework.
   The Science Talent Search finalists were selected from 1,339
entries in the 47th annual national competition funded by
Westinghouse Electric Corp. The competition, open to high school
seniors, involves science projects created, researched and
assembled by the students. Five past winners have gone on to become
Nobel Prize winners.
   The finalists come from 17 states and are in Washington for
final judging in the competition. Winners will be announced at a
banquet Monday night when scholarships and cash prizes worth
$140,000 will be awarded. Top prize is a $20,000 scholarship.
   In the survey, the talent search scholars were asked how they
spent their time on a weekly basis. The averages, expressed in
hours per week, were:
   Studying, 18 hours.
   Friendships, 7.9 hours.
   Family, six hours.
   Pleasure reading, five hours.
   Part-time jobs, 4.7 hours.
   Participant sports, 4.6 hours.
   Student affairs, 3.8 hours.
   Other (includes independent research), 3.6 hours.
   Community affairs, 1.7 hours.
   Spectator sports, 1.5 hours.

<HEAD>Robertson Pushes Ahead With Libel Suit Although Trial Set Super
Tuesday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican presidential candidate Pat
Robertson appears ready to push his politically risky libel suit
against a former congressman who questioned his war record even
though the trial is set for Super Tuesday.
   Robertson, who once expressed reget he ever brought the case,
says former Rep. Paul N. McCloskey, R-Calif., is a ``patent liar''
for saying he invoked the political influence of his late father,
Sen. A. Willis Robertson, D-Va., to avoid combat in the Korean War.
   At a press conference in Atlanta on Wednesday, Robertson
conceded that going to trial March 8 _ a day he hopes to do well in
a dozen Southern primaries _ leaves him in ``an untenable
position.''
   ``I have a choice of fulfilling my constitutional right to run
for president ... or every American's right to have his day in
court,'' Robertson told reporters.
   ``The trial is going ahead. I'm looking for some alternative, we
haven't made up our mind,'' Robertson said, hinting he might seek a
way out of his political and legal dilemma.
   But Robertson insisted that paying McCloskey's legal fees of
nearly $400,000 ``is not an option'' even though the former
congressman says he would settle on that basis.
   ``I wouldn't pay a nickel to somebody who is a patent liar,''
Robertson said.
   McCloskey said Robertson's position means a trial of the case is
likely to begin on Super Tuesday before U.S. District Judge Joyce
Hens Green, who refused Robertson's earlier request to postpone the
proceeding until after the primaries are over.
   ``At this stage he has already put us close to $400,000 in legal
fees, we might as well go to trial,'' McCloskey said in a telephone
interview. ``I think that the jury is the best possible place to
determine if he is telling the truth or I am.''
   Roberston filed the lawsuit after two syndicated columns
published the contents of a letter McCloskey wrote to Rep. Andrew
Jacobs Jr., D-Ind., charging that the former television evangelist
cabled his father from Japan to get out of combat duty.
   McCloskey, a decorated Marine who was aboard the troop ship from
which Robertson was removed, also said the former television
evangelist was a ``booze officer'' to a rear-echelon unit.
   Professional political analysts have questioned Robertson's
judgment in filing the case. Robertson himself was quoted by Time
magazine last September as saying: ``In all candor, I think it was
a bad idea.''
   Because of the possibility of intense media coverage during the
three-week trial, political professionals have questioned the
wisdom of proceeding with the suit.
   ``The thing is so dangerous for him, I would just get out of the
thing any way I could get out,'' said Democratic political
consultant Robert Beckel, adding: ``I see nothing coming out of it
good politically for him.''
   ``Most people are not aware of the allegation, the average voter
hasn't focused on Robertson's war record. Nobody is going to attack
him on it. Why raise it yourself?'' Beckel said.
   Charles Black, who is working for rival GOP candidate Jack Kemp,
said, ``I've always thought it was a big negative for him.''
   ``I'm not in a position to judge who's right and who's wrong
about the charges,'' he said. But ``having a libel trial right in
the middle of the primary season will obviously dramatize the
charges against him.''
   By proceeding to trial, Robertson risks extensive news coverage
of potentially embarrassing testimony by several former Marines who
support McCloskey's story and add tales of their own.
   One former Marine said in a deposition that Robertson ``messed
around with the prostitutes'' and was ``scared to death'' of
contracting gonorrhea. Robertson's lawyers are trying to suppress
that comment from the trial as irrelevent to the issues in the case.
   Despite Robertson's expressed misgivings over going forward,
lawyers for both sides say they are preparing to try the case and
are not talking about a settlement.

<HEAD>FTC Member Turns Over Documents Demanded By House Panel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Federal Trade Commission member says he's
told his aides not to put anything in writing anymore since a
congressional panel forced him to disclose documents under threat
of finding him in contempt of Congress.
   Commissioner Terry Calvani escaped the contempt citation
Wednesday by appearing under subpoena before the House Committee on
Energy and Commerce's subcommittee on oversight and investigations
and turning over the requested documents, ending a battle that
began last October.
   ``I tell the men and women that serve in my office that I want
their wholly candid assessment and unvarnished recommendation about
matters before me,'' he told the panel, headed by Rep. John D.
Dingell, D-Mich. ``This morning I have instructed my staff that
from henceforth they should not commit their work to paper.''
   The internal documents demanded by the panel concerned the FTC's
views on whether unfair and deceptive advertising practices were
occurring in the airline industry.
   The FTC had written a letter to the National Association of
Attorneys General which reflected that the agency had not studied
the matter. A press release on the question, however, indicated
that the agency believed the airline industry had no such problems.
   The reading of a reference to the press release comment on the
House floor last October helped defeat an amendment by Dingell that
would have transferred responsibility for airline industry consumer
protection from the Department of Transportation to the FTC, said
subcommittee counsel Patrick McLain.
   Rep. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., said the statement indicated to
the House members that the FTC believed airline industry consumer
protection was fine as it was and there was no need for the FTC to
take over.
   ``The amendment intended to help the consumers of the country
was greatly thwarted,'' he said.
   Several days after the vote, the subcommittee began asking the
FTC for internal documents on the matter.
   Two commissioners said they had no such documents, two others
allowed subcommittee staff to read pertinent materials in their
offices, but Calvani refused to provide access to such documents.
   After the subcommittee and Calvani exchanged several letters,
the panel on Feb. 4 subpoenaed Calvani to appear and bring the
documents.
   Calvani said that until Friday, the panel had not provided the
legal justification for him to provide the requested materials.
   After testifying, Calvani said he believed he had become caught
in a ``turf fight'' between Dingell and Rep. James J. Howard,
D-N.J., chairman of the Committee on Public Works and
Transportation, who wanted the Transportation Department to keep
control of airline industry consumer protection.
   ``They were looking for a scapegoat, and I'm the unfortunate
person chosen for that,'' he said.
   Dingell's office referred all requests for a response to
Calvani's allegation to McLain, who refused to comment.
   However, both Republican and Democratic panel members said
during the hearing that they supported the issuance of the subpoena
and the need for the documents.

<HEAD>Reagan: If Robertson Had Hostage Information, He Didn't Tell
Administration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan questioned GOP hopeful Pat
Robertson's contention that he had information about American
hostages being held in Lebanon, saying if the former television
evangelist did have such knowledge, ``he kept it to himself.''
   ``It'd be very strange if he actually did have information as to
the location of those hostages,'' the president said at a
nationally broadcast news conference Wednesday night. ``Isn't it
strange that no one in our administration was ever apprised of
that?''
   Robertson said Wednesday his Christian Broadcasting Network once
knew the whereabouts of American hostages in Lebanon ``and they
could have been freed.'' Robertson spokesmen later said the the
former television evangelist was referring to hostages seized when
a TWA flight was hijacked to Beirut in 1985, who were eventually
freed.
   When he was asked about Robertson's assertion, Reagan said he
didn't want to comment on the campaign. But he said of the
hostages: ``We have tried our best and through every kind of
channel to establish their whereabouts because that's the beginning
of efforts to try and get them free.''
   ``If he thought that he knew'' where hostages were being held,
Reagan said of Robertson, ``he kept it to himself.''
   ``It's very frustrating to try and establish a location,'' said
the president. ``But we've never let up, and we never will, in
trying to obtain the freedom of all the hostages.''
   Nine Americans are in captivity in Lebanon, including Marine Lt.
Col. William R. Higgins, who was captured last week. Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
is the longest-held captive, having been kidnapped on March 16,
1985.
   Robertson spokesman Scott Hatch said after Reagan spoke: ``I
think what Pat said was accurate.''
   Even before the president's news conference, Robertson's
comments drew quick criticism from two of his GOP presidential
rivals, Rep. Jack Kemp and Vice President George Bush.
   Kemp, in a statement, called Robertson's statements
irresponsible and said he should ``apologize to the families of the
hostages whom he has needlessly hurt in an attempt to gain
publicity.''
   ``I don't think it was irresponsible at all,'' said Hatch. ``The
whole context was how Pat would deal with terrorism, and he used
that as an example.''
   Bush, campaigning in Boston, said: ``My question would be, how
come he didn't get hold of the proper authorities in the United
States government that were working day and night, trying to figure
out how they could get these people out?''
   Robertson's comments came at an Atlanta news conference during
which he complained that U.S. intelligence in the Middle East is
inadequate and declared that action must be quick when Americans
are taken hostage.
   ``We identified in our news department at CBN the location of
those hostages in Lebanon very shortly after they were taken, and
they were in a position where they could have been rescued,'' he
said.
   ``They were in Beirut, and they could have been freed.''
   Robertson did not provide specifics and did not say which
hostages were involved.
   Benton Miller, spokesman for CBN, based in Virginia Beach, Va.,
said the comments pertained to hostages who had been taken from TWA
Flight 847 in 1985. He later issued a synopsis of the news report
to which Robertson referred.
   The synopsis said that in response to a question from Robertson,
a CBN Middle East correspondent, who was not named, said the
hostages, ``are in several locations in and around Lebanon and we
have also learned that maybe at least one of them, and we do not
know which one, but we have been told by intelligence sources in
Lebanon, that at least one may be being held in Tehran.''
   The suspicion concerning the hostage thought to be held in
Tehran was later reported as incorrect in a subsequent news report
on Robertson's ``700 Club'' talk show, Miller said.
   Asked whether he had told the Reagan administration what he
knew, Robertson said, ``I broadcast it on national television; they
monitor our programs virtually every day.''
   Robertson aide Gary Lane said during the TWA hostage situation,
the State Department contacted CBN for information at that time,
but he said he did not know exactly who made the contact.
   A State Department terrorism expert said he was puzzled by
Robertson's statements, saying he was unaware that CBN had ever
broadcast the precise locations of any hostages.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said
knowledge of hostages' whereabouts in terms of a particular city or
even a section of a city wouldn't be enough to mount a rescue
mission.
   Robertson's comments on the hostages marked the second time in
two weeks that his statements on international matters have sparked
controversy. During a Republican presidential debate on Feb. 14, he
alleged that the Soviets have nuclear missiles in Cuba, pointing to
the United States. The Reagan administration denied it.
   In yet another controversy, Bush asked Robertson to apologize or
provide proof to back up his suggestion on Tuesday that
anti-Robertson political motivations were behind the timing of
public allegations of sexual misconduct against television
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart.
   ``By sundown in the old South, I'd like to see him stand up like
a Southern gentleman with a little evidence,'' Bush said. ``I'd
like to see an apology or proof.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It seemed at first like an innovative way of
getting the British to talk about something other than the weather.
But things apparently went too far.
   Talkabout, a telephone company service linking strangers
together for chats in groups of up to 10 at a time, was forced to
hang up permanently this week under a barrage of public criticism.
   For British Telecom, the country's main telephone company,
Talkabout was a gold mine. The company's privatization in 1984
after decades of state ownership has made it far more
profit-conscious and Talkabout earned it up to $17.5 million a year.
   But parents complained Talkabout rang up huge phone bills.
Members of Parliament claimed it had become a dating service and
drug exchange. Lurid tales circulated of girls being seduced by
older men and of young neo-Nazis pouring out racist hatred.
   While the tabloid press highlighted the sensational aspects of
Talkabout, the Office of Telecommunications (OFTEL), the phone
company's watchdog body, warned that British Telecom's monopoly
privileges would be reviewed unless customers could have Talkabout
blocked from their lines.
   British Telecom said the cost would be prohibitive and on Monday
it stopped the service.
   No one claims to have actually heard the service being seriously
abused, and British Telecom hotly denies the seduction stories. If
anything, say critics who called in to hear Talkabout for
themselves, the conversations generally were dull and witless.
   Nonetheless, Terry Lewis, a lawmaker for the opposition Labor
Party who campaigned against Talkabout, insisted ``the service is
obscene, dangerous, addictive and costly.''
   Costly, definitely. At up to 71 cents a minute at peak time,
Talkabout cost eight times more than an ordinary call.
   Addictive, perhaps. Youngsters calling in to a radio talk show
said they sometimes spent up to four hours a day on Talkabout.
   But obscene and dangerous? British Telecom says the service
attracted 40 million calls but only 27 complaints since its
inception in 1983.
   ``We provided a quite innocent and socially useful pastime to
many thousands of customers,'' the company said in a statement
announcing Talkabout's closure.
   British Telecom says it was prepared for trouble from the
outset, and built in safeguards.
   Conversations were limited to 10 minutes and separate services
existed for teen-agers and for adults.
   A tape recording warned callers not to divulge surnames,
addresses or phone numbers during conversation, and about 200
monitors stood by at the 25 Talkabout exchanges around the country,
ready to step in and cut off abusers.
   ``None of that,'' a monitor would interject the moment a
conversation looked like veering into smut or racism. ``You know
the rules. If you won't behave I will cut you off.''
   But conversation was often an unintelligible mish-mash of
competing voices. Even if an interesting conversation got going,
the 10-minute rule soon guillotined it.
   The notion of Talkabout as a battering ram against the fabled
reserve of the British character was ``one of our theories,'' a
British Telecom spokesman said, insisting on anonymity citing
company rules.
   ``People sit opposite each other on the train five days a week
going to work and never talk. Some of them would probably love an
anonymous chat on Talkabout,'' he added.

   A former Cuban political prisoner in the
Reagan administration is being portrayed by Havana as a terrorist,
liar and impostor who has become a key figure in a U.S. effort to
discredit Cuba.
   Cuba escalated its campaign on Wednesday against Armando
Valladares, head of the U.S. delegation to the U.N. Human Rights
Commission in Geneva, accusing the State Department of spreading
``15 lies'' about his past.
   The Reagan administration has described Valladares as a victim
of Cuban repression who spent 22 years in prison merely for
expressing opposition to communism. It has denied Cuban charges
that Valladares worked for the secret police of the rightist
dictatorship that was overthrown by Fidel Castro and his forces in
1959.
   Cuban diplomats in Washington, the United Nations and Geneva
distributed a 37-page pamphlet outlining the purported U.S. lies
and making public a State Department document where the alleged
misrepresentations are said to have been made.
   Cuba released the pamphlet as Valladares was preparing an
attempt to win approval by the U.N. commission of a resolution
seeking to place Cuba's human rights practices on the 1989 agenda
of the panel. A similar effort last year failed by a single vote.
   Valladares is perhaps best known for his book, ``Against All
Hope,'' in which he outlines what he claims was his systematic
mistreatment during his long detention.
   The Cuban document, disputing the State Department, said
Valladares was never ``a prisoner of conscience'' but rather a
subversive who later became a ``dissident manufactured by the
government of the United States ... to serve its anti-Cuban
campaigns.''
   The Cuban document said that Valladares worked for a
counter-revolutionary group found to possess lethal weapons. But
the State Department contended that a thorough search of
Valladares' home after his December 1960 arrest turned up no
weapons or other evidence of subversive activities.
   The 10-page undated State Department memo made public by the
Cuban government appeared to be authentic, according to a U.S.
official who is familiar with Valladares' role in the government.
   The memo was sent as a cable to all U.S. diplomatic and consular
posts for use as a counter to the ``massive defamation campaign''
against Valladares being waged by Cuba.
   The Cuban document, discussing the U.S. ``lies'' about
Valladares, also said it is not true that:
   _Cuba had ever declared that Valladares had engaged in torture
while serving in the pre-revolutionary secret police.
   _Valladares was arrested for speaking out against communism and
for refusing to display a sign of revolutionary propaganda on his
office desk.
   _Cuba manufactured a forged police identity card in an effort to
verify his service in the secret police.

   Travelers know they're in the South when: A)
The Confederate flag is flying over the state capitol; B) There are
more pickups than cars on the highway; C) A transplanted Asiatic
vine entangles practically everything.
   Unfortunately farmers, loggers, utilities and lovers of roadside
scenery know the answer is C.
   People all over the South know and curse kudzu (pronounced
kuhd'-zoo). The transplanted vine once thought to be a savior has
acquired a status akin to a carpetbagger.
   Planted heavily in Mississippi and other Southern states during
the Depression to control erosion, kudzu's welcome soon wore out as
it spread from the gullies it was planted in. It now covers an area
the size of Belgium.
   ``There are mixed opinions about it,'' said James Wolfe, a plant
materials specialist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Soil
Conservation Service, an agency responsible for kudzu planting
during the 1930's.
   ``A lot of people seem to fear it quite a bit. I don't think
it's as bad as some people would say,'' Wolfe said last week. ``It
may not be beneficial, but it's got a lot of character about it as
you travel down the highway and see it climbing all over trees.''
   Kudzu has spread as far as 25 miles on each side of the road
where it was planted 40 years ago, covering trees, old houses and
abandoned cars. The lumber industry, in particular, is not fond of
the plant because it can kill trees by blocking out the light.
   Some of the heaviest concentrations in Mississippi can be found
in the rich cotton-farming area in the Delta region. Macabre
formations of the clinging vine can be seen suffocating trees as
travelers pass through towns such as Flora, Yazoo City and Tchula
on Mississippi 49.
   The vine, brought from Japan in 1876 as an ornamental plant, can
grow as much as 100 feet in a summer _ a foot a day. And without
harsh winters to kill it, or natural predators, it picks up each
spring where it left off the previous fall.
   The weight of its vines has been known to pull down utility
lines.
   ``Kudzu is tough to control. If we don't keep it down it will
climb the poles and guidelines and cause electrical outages,''
Mississippi Power & Light spokesman Ed Jussely said. ``Through a
consistant maintenance program we have been successful in stopping
the outages, but it is a difficult problem for us every year.''
   Kudzu now covers over 7 million acres in Mississippi, Georgia,
Alabama and parts of surrounding states. It extends as far north as
southern Missouri and West Virginia, and as far west as Texas.
   Farmers, utilities and the lumber industry are engaged in a
never-ending battle against kudzu _ Alabama even passed a law
against owning kudzu seeds or seedlings.
   The only thing that will stop it is constant cutting. Farmers
often let cattle feed on kudzu because its nutritional value is
about the same as alfalfa and overgrazing will kill it.
   Outside of open pasture, however, kudzu is king. A variety of
chemicals and other methods have been tried to stop it, none with
much success.
   ``Generally, programs involve a paper company or a few farmers,
but there is not a statewide program to get rid of it,'' said Wayne
Houston, a weed specialist at Mississippi State University.
``Generally, whatever you put down to kill kudzu also kills the
trees. It's difficult and expensive to kill it.''

<HEAD>Signals Change On US Participation In GATT</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

   President Reagan says the question of Soviet
participation in an international trade organization is currently
``being reviewed,'' even though his administration has staunchly
opposed such a move in the past.
   During his news conference Wednesday night, Reagan was asked
whether he would discuss trade liberalization in his upcoming
meeting in Moscow with Soviet Leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and
whether he supports the Soviet bid to join the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
   ``I do know that there has been consideration of them involving
themselves in the GATT procedure, and that, of course, is being
reviewed among those of us who are participants now,'' Reagan said.
   In the past, the United States has led the effort to block
Soviet participation in the 95-nation compact which sets and
enforces international trading rules.
   Just last Jan. 20, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
underscored the administration's opposition to Soviet participation
in either GATT or its sister economic organizations, the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund.
   The Soviet economic system ``remains at this point fundamentally
incompatible with participation in free-world institutions,''
Fitzwater said at the time. ``In essence, they don't have a
free-world economy.
   ``The Treasury Department and the administration remain opposed
to Soviet membership.''
   A position of continued opposition to Soviet membership in the
international financial organizations also was spelled out in a
January report to Congress from the White House, entitled
``National Security Strategy of the United States.''
   That report did note ``Soviet policy statements regarding
reconstruction and economic reform,'' suggesting to some analysts
that the GATT-membership question was an open one.
   However, the report went on to add, ``The Soviet economic system
remains at this point fundamentally incompatible with participation
in free world institutions.''
   In September 1986, the United States successfully led the
opposition to a Soviet effort to join GATT to participate in a new
round of trade-liberalization talks, now under way in Geneva.
   Reagan declined to go into details of what he would discuss with
Gorbachev during his Moscow visit this spring.
   On the general subject of East-West trade, Reagan said: ``Our
trade with the Soviet union is restricted mainly on the basis of
where we might be giving them technology and information that could
be used one day against us.''
   Currently, most high-tech equipment is banned from export to the
Soviet Union. However, the administration is currently at work
trimming the list of non-strategic items than can be shipped to the
Soviet bloc.

   Here is a transcript of President Reagan's
news conference Wednesday night.
   On the networks at last! (Laughter.)
   Good evening.
   Before I take your questions, I have a brief opening statement.
   Secretary of State George Shultz today reported to me on his
recent trip to Moscow and it was encouraging.
   Progress continues to be made on our four-part agenda and the
commitment remains to do all that we can to advance the cause of
peace and to settle regional conflicts.
   In the Middle East, it's time for all parties to rid themselves
of old ideas and stances that cannot work and to begin a serious
process of negotiation and reconciliation.
   Any process that is undertaken must meet Israel's security needs
and satisfy the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.
   Secretary Shultz leaves tonight for the Middle East to see if
practical and real progress can be made that provides a pathway to
a comprehensive settlement.
   And he carries with him my full support.
   There's another regional conflict that has serious implications
for our country's security interests, Nicaragua.
   Our policy consistently has been to bring peace and freedom to
all of Central America.
   Today, four of the five Central American countries choose their
governments in free and open democratic elections.
   Independent courts protect their human rights, and their people
can hope for a better life for themselves and their children.
   One country, Nicaragua, with its communist regime, remains a
threat to this democratic tide in the region.
   So our message to the people of Nicaragua tonight is the same as
it has been for the past seven years _ freedom based on true
democratic principles.
   In the past several months there have been some limited steps
taken by the communist regime in Nicaragua toward reform.
   Now is not the time to reverse that process.
   So there's no argument that all of us seek peace and democracy
in Nicaragua, and the difference is how to achieve that goal.
   On Feb. 3, Congress voted on continued support for the
democratic resistance in Nicaragua.
   And to my disappointment, the majority in the House of
Representatives voted to remove the pressure of the democratic
resistance on the Sandinista regime.

<TEXT>
   However, the Senate agreed with me, that we cannot leave those
fighting for freedom in Nicaragua at the mercy of the communist
regime and expect the process toward democracy to move ahead.
   We've already seen what happens when pressure is removed.
   In just two short weeks, the Sandinistas threatened the only
free press in that country and rejected a cease-fire proposal made
by the mediator, Cardinal Obando, which incorporated the essential
elements laid out and agreed to last August.
   And in the first two months of 1988, Soviet military assistance
to Nicaragua has almost doubled, compared to the same period in
1987.
   These do not represent signs of peace.
   These remain troubling indications of a regime determined to
crush its opposition and threaten its neighbors.
   There is a choice.
   We must act to ensure that freedom is not smothered in Nicaragua
and to guarantee that these latest promises will be kept in a
timely way.
   End of statement. And Helen?
   Q. Mr. President, through the years you've been very eloquent on
the subject of human rights in the Soviet Union and Nicaragua. Why
_ the question really is, why have you never condemned the
treatment of the Palestinians in the occupied areas. Shooting
unarmed protestors, beating people to death _ children, trying to
bury some alive. And I'd like to follow up.
   A. Helen, we have made _ we have spoken to the government there.
   And we've also spoken to the Palestinian leadership because
there's every evidence that these riots are not just spontaneous
and homegrown.
   But we have spoken, and we have _ and that's why _ part of the
reason why the secretary of state is going back over there.
   We don't support that sort of thing, and we're trying to
persuade all the participants to try to arrive at a solution
representing justice for all.
   Q. Well, if you want that, and you say you believe in security
for Israel and legitimate rights of the Palestinians, why don't you
go on the public record now and say that there should be an
exchange _ a removal of the occupation and a peace?

   A. Well, I don't think it's up to us to dictate a settlement in
the Middle East.
   Q. We are great supporters of Israel, so we certainly have some
influence.
   A. Yes, and we have used that a number of times and are using it
now.
   But, we think that _ and the thing that is taking the secretary
of state there _ we think that the necessity is for all who are
represented in that situation on both sides should come together
when you stop to think that legitimate _ that legally a state of
war still exists there in the Middle East between the Arab nations
and Israel, and that it's time for us to arrive at a true peace and
recognize the rights of all.
   Q. Mr. President, Shiite militia men are scouring southern
Lebanon for Colonel Higgins, the American kidnapped last week, and
you've expressed a determination to get him out. Can you say that
the same intense efforts, the same kind of dragnet will be used to
find the other American hostages, one of whom, Terry Anderson, is
about to mark the end of his third year in captivity?
   A. We have never given up on that.
   It's _ as you can realize, it's very frustrating to try and
establish a location, knowing of course that you are governed by
the fact that unwise action on our part could bring about harm to
the hostages.
   But, we've never let up and we never will in trying to obtain
the freedom of all the hostages.
   Q. Sir, Pat Robertson said today that his Christian Broadcasting
Network once knew the location of American hostages in the Middle
East and that the United States in effect missed an opportunity to
rescue them. I understand he's clarified that remark, but I wonder
if you have any thoughts about the tone that he's setting in this
campaign?
   A. Well, all I can say _ I don't want to comment on the
campaign, but I can only say this, that it would be very strange if
he actually did have information as to the location of those
hostages.
   Isn't it strange that no one in our administration was ever
apprised of that?
   We have tried our best and through every kind of channel to
establish their whereabouts because that's the beginning of efforts
to try and get them free.
   But, I just _ if he thought that he knew, he kept it to himself.
Trude.
   Q. Mr. President, as of now, is there any change in our policy
of not talking with the PLO in light of the fact that there are
reports out of Geneva that Mr. Arafat is now ready to accept U.N.
Resolution 338 and 242?

   A. Well, I know that this is one other thing we're pursuing.
   If he really is, and if he is willing to acknowledge the right
of Israel to exist as a nation _ this has been one of the blocking
points, that, how do you sit down and try to get into a talk about
peace when someone says they have no right to even exist?
   And I'm sure that the secretary of state will be _ is apprised
of that fact, and will see what we can do there.
   Q. And given _ may I follow up?
   A. Yes.
   Q. And given the 40-year hostility in the area which has been
built up, how can you as the Great Communicator try to alleviate
some of the antagonism between the Israelis and the Palestinians
before you leave office?
   A. Well, we are trying to, and we'll continue to try to.
   That's a goal that I think would _ I would think would be one of
the greatest achievements of this administration, if before I
leave, we could bring about a peace in the Middle East.
   Q. Mr. President, whom precisely are you criticizing when you
say that the riots are not homegrown and not spontaneous?
   A. Well, we have had _ it's a little difficult for me, because I
_ there's some things that I shouldn't be saying. But we have had
intimations that there have been certain people suspected of being
terrorists, outsiders coming in, not only with weapons, but
stirring up and encouraging the trouble in those areas.
   Now, that isn't something you can go out and say we absolutely
know, but certainly the violence is both ways.
   Q. But it would seem, sir, that that's still a generalization,
if you say some people from the outside. Can't you not be specific
and say just who it is?
   A. No, because I get into areas there that would be violating
security rules, and I don't think I should.
   Q. The PLO, Russians?
   A. What?
   Q. PLO? Russians?
   A. No. No.
   Q. Mr. President, it's my understanding that in 1985 your
National Security Adviser, Robert McFarlane, briefed you on the
Iraqi pipeline project, and got and gained your approval for it. In
light of the difficulties that your attorney general, Mr. Meese, is
encountering now, could you explain your position on the pipeline
and tell me if you think it was a good idea at that time?
   Q. I have no recall of knowing anything about this pipeline plan
until fairly recently, and then found out with regard to the
transmittal of the letters that have now been turned over to the
special investigator. And this was about the first information that
I recall having.
   Now, I can't say to you that something _ that I was given
information earlier, because I just have to tell you if I was, I
have totally forgotten _ that I have no knowledge of anything of
that kind.

   Q. Well, Mr. President, does it trouble you at all that your
dear friend Mr. Meese has become entangled in this project, and it
has yet been another case which has brought him some, some would
say, embarrassment?
   A. Let me just say one thing, I have every confidence in his
integrity.
   I've known him for more than 20 years, but I cannot comment in
any way on this case that is now before a special investigator.
   Sam?
   Q. Mr. President, the white minority government of South Africa
has now effectively banned activities by dissenting organizations,
even when those activities are peaceful. What is your view on that,
and what can you do, if anything, to reverse it?
   A. Well, the State Department has already contacted them about
that, and we are making our own feelings clear that they should be
working toward a multiracial democracy, and not oppressing
organization _ political organizations there.
   And we've made our feelings clear about that.
   Q. Well, sir, may I follow up? Have you considered sending aid
to the freedom fighters _ the ANC or any other organization _
against this oppression just as you send aid to other freedom
fighters around the world?
   A. No, we have not involved ourselves in that other than things
such as the sanctions and so forth.
   We have tried our best to be persuasive in this very difficult
problem and to find _ or to encourage a better solution.
   Q. Well, what's the difference?
   A. Well, the difference is that we don't have an armed
insurrection going as we have in some other countries, and we have
a great division even among the people who are being oppressed.
   It is a tribal policy more than it is a racial policy, and that
is one of the most difficult parts here.
   Q. Mr. President, throughout your administration, when members
of your Cabinet or members of the administration have been accused
of any kind of wrongdoing or simply of bad judgment, it's been your
policy generally to say nothing. Is your loyalty more important to
you than the perception that the members of the government must be
above reproach?
   A. No, Bill, and I have to say that I do not favor violations of
ethics or laws at all in or out of government, but I do want to
call your attention to one thing.
   I think _ and this has gone on pretty much throughout the time
that I've been here _ that there is a kind of lynch-mob atmosphere
that takes place, and people are _ the memories are there of this
person, that person and so forth, but no attention is paid to the
fact that how many of them, when it actually came to trial, was
found to be totally innocent, but in the meantime, they have been
smeared nationwide, and it's very difficult for people to remember
what the outcome was.
   They only remember the other of the _ in other words, guilt was
by accusation and not by actual trial and conviction.
   And I could call to your attention, too, Ray Donovan, Jim Beggs
of the space program _ both of them totally cleared of any
wrongdoing whatsoever, and this has been true of a great many
others.
   But those that were doing something wrong and were apprehended
and it was proven on them, they're no longer with us.
   Q. Well, sir, people have asked if, as in the case of the
Iran-Contra affair, when the committee which investigated it said
that _ noted that you never condemned the actions of those members
of your staff who were involved. The question was raisd whether
your silence meant that you did not find their actions
objectionable?
   A. No, they _ when they came under the judgment of the law and
the judgment was made and _ great regret if someone was guilty of
wrongdoing, but they were punished accordingly.

   Q. Mr. President, what are you doing to make things easier for
corporations to trade with the Soviet Union in non-strategic items,
such as food processing, pharmaceuticals, automotive, and hotels,
for instance? And do you believe the Soviet Union should join GATT,
the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs? And will you discuss
these and other trade items with Mr. Gorbachev in your forthcoming
summit?
   A. Well, I can't relate to you discussions about those
particular things with him.
   But I do know that there has been consideration of them
involving themselves in the GATT procedure, and that, of course, is
being reviewed among those of us who are participants now.
   But I don't know whether that answers your question, or not, but
our trade with the Soviet Union is restricted mainly on the basis
of where we might be giving them technology and information that is
_ could be used one day against us.
   Q. Mr. President, I know you have to remain neutral in the
Republican race, but you could clear up a major issue right now by
telling us whether George Bush, in fact, did have reservations
about the sale of arms to Iran, whether he had reservations about
Israel's role in that policy and whether, in fact, he's telling the
truth when he tells us that he did have those reservations.
   A. Yes, in the general discussion _ and that's not unusual here.
   I've ordered our people on Cabinet matters or anything else and
I want to hear what they really feel.
   I don't want to be surrounded by ``yes'' men.
   And, yes, there were reservations, but I'm not going to go into
_ just as he wouldn't go into the private discussions that we may
have had.
   But I think it's time for me to point out what the opposition
was based on of anyone who did oppose.
   Particularly, it's been revealed that Secretary Weinberger and
George Shultz both objected.
   They did not object the idea of _ that we were trading arms for
hostages.
   Their objection _ they knew what we were trying to do.
   This had been a request that came to us from some people not in
the government of Iran, but who wanted to privately meet with us on
how there could be a better relationship if and when the day came
that there was a new government in Iran.
   And if you'll remember, back in those days, almost every other
day there was speculation that the health of the Khomeini was
failing to where there might be this contest for a new government.
   Their objection was _ what we had done _ we'd gotten this
request and in dealing with it, in this conversation with these
private individuals _ we pointed out our feelings about terrorism
and so forth.
   They agreed with us.
   And the thing was that they _ the Hezbollah, as we know, is
philosophically attuned to Iran.
   The idea was that they could perhaps influence the Hezbollah to
give up some of our hostages.
   And indeed, as the talks went on, they did.
   We got two of them free.
   But their objection was that if and when this became known, as
it would be, it would be made to appear that we were trading
hostages for _ or arms for hostages.
   Now, we were _ we were getting these arms to these individuals
because we felt that maybe they could influence the Hezbollah.
   We weren't dealing with the kidnappers at all.
   And this was what the whole situation was.
   But it turned out that George and Cap, and those who had doubts,
were right in that when it did become known, by way of a henchman
of the ayatollah, then everyone just automatically said that _ and
to this day are saying it was arms for hostages.

   Q. On the issue of George Bush and his role though, this has
become one of the major issues between the vice president and
Senator Dole. Now, although you have to remain neutral, as the
author of the 11th Commandment, thou shalt not criticize one's
fellow Republicans, do you have any advice for these two men, and
aren't you getting a little concerned that they might be hurting
the Republican chances by their very bitter political feud?
   A. Well, whether I am concerned or not, I am not going to
comment on things like that.
   I am going to say that they know my feelings, all of them, about
the 11th Commandment.
   Q. No advice at all to them?
   A. Jerry.
   Q. Mr. President, the resignation of Secretary of the Navy Webb
has ignited a controversy about the _ your build-up of the United
States Navy. And the question is, are you satisfied with the budget
cuts in the military have not damaged our national security, and
are you still committed to a 600-ship Navy at a time when the
Soviets are not cutting their navy?
   Q. I am committed to the 600-ship Navy, and I want you to know,
Jerry, that from the very beginning since I've been here, the
Congress has cut my request for defense every time.
   And sometimes, they have tried to pretend that that is in an
effort to reduce the deficit spending and so forth.
   But in a five-year period, the Congress cut my defense budgets a
total of $125 billion at the same time that they increased my
request for domestic programs by $250 billion.
   And this _ this budget which is now being attributed to me _ no,
this isn't as low as they originally wanted to cut it.
   But it was as high as we could get it in the negotiations for
the present budget.
   And it has been harmful, but let me tell you that in 1980 when
we came here, the Navy had 479 vessels. And by 1987, we had 568.
And by next year it will be 580.
   And so what has happened is that there will be a little delay in
the achieving of the 600-ship Navy.
   But I can't help but remind, or tell all of you _ when I was
campaigning in 1980 and knew the state of our defenses, I was faced
with a question _ and some of you will recall _ I did a lot of
campaigning on question-and-answer basis.
   At almost every gathering, there would be a question _ well, if
I came to a choice between deficit spending and build-up of our
defense structure, which would I choose?
   And every time, I said, in responsibility, I would have to
choose the build-up of our defenses.
   And every time, in every audience in America that I said that
to, gave me an applause that was almost an ovation for saying that.
   Q. The second part of the question was, is it a threat to the
national security that the Navy is not going to have 600 ships _ on
the schedule that you had in mind?
   A. I don't think right at the moment, and with the way we're
progressing in various treaties and so forth, I don't believe that
the threat is that immediate.
   And _ but because very shortly, we will achieve our 600.
   We want 15 carriers and their squadrons, and we've just launched
the 15th carrier, 100 nuclear-powered attack submarines and four
battleships, and we're achieving them.

   Q. Mr. President, you must certify by March 1 whether Panama has
been cracking down on drug trafficking through that country, or
whether aid to Panama should be continued to be suspended. What are
you going to do?
   A. Well, I can't give you the answer yet because we're still
working on that and still collecting the facts as to what their
effort has been at trying to intercept the drugs and join us in
that campaign.
   But, as you said, March 1 we will be giving the answer.
   Q. Sir, if I could follow up, some officials in your
administration have suggested that if Noriega would step down and
go into exile, that you would stop the prosecution of him on drug
charges. Would you consider that kind of deal?
   A. No, and I'm not going to comment on something of this kind.
   This man has been indicted by a federal grand jury, and so I'm
not going to make any comment of that kind, nor have we made any
advances or suggestions of that kind to the government of Panama.
   What we would like to see is a return to democracy and a
civilian government in Panama, and not this domination by literally
a military dictator.
   Q. Mr. President, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan today
objected to pressure from the administration regarding the
formulation of monetary policy, such as contained in the budget and
the economic report and a Treasury letter to Federal Reserve Board
members. Don't you have confidence in your appointee to the Fed,
Alan Greenspan, as chairman?
   A. Yes, I do, and I'm going to have to find out what this is all
about that you're talking about. Because nothing of that kind had
been directed to me.
   Q. Mr. President, back to the Contra aid question _ in your
opening statement you seemed to suggest that the Sandinistas are
taking advantage of Congress not coming through with Contra aid to
withdraw some of the concessions that had made. With Congress about
to consider new humanitarian aid, both the Democratic and
Republican plan, is it worth it to pass humanitarian aid without
military aid?
   A. Well, I think the only comment that I can make there is that
anything that will keep the freedom fighters as a pressure on the
Sandinistas is worth doing.
   Just as when we tried to pass our own bill and narrowly failed,
you could see that the military aid was down the road a ways _ it
was not necessary right now.
   The other aid _ humanitarian aid _ is more imminent.
   And so, if we'll _ if we can get that, that's fine, and then
we'll take our chances on the other in trying to get it.
   But they do still have some military store for a limited period
of time.
   Q. If I may follow up on that point, sir, in the two plans that
are being considered, the Democrats want the Defense Department to
deliver whatever stores and supplies are authorized. The Republican
plan would give that responsibility to the CIA. Do you favor either
course?
   A. I certainly would favor the CIA.
   I think that involving our military when there is no need to is
very rash and foolish because you would be putting our military
into a combat situation and this is what we've been trying to avoid
in Central America all the way.

   Q. In that regard, Mr. President, I'd like to ask you about the
latest hostage situation. Do you think it was responsible for your
administration to allow a Marine lieutenant colonel, William
Higgins, to operate in southern Lebanon at a time when eight
Americans were already being held in that country and when your own
State Department was recommending against travel there _ and,
considering the ramifications of the abduction of William Buckley
earlier?
   A. I don't think that you can use that as a measure of where
officers can be assigned to duty.
   They're in a dangerous business to begin with, and this _ we are
a part of the United Nations and we have obligations to the U.N.
with regard to the UNIFIL force that has been there for a number of
years now, and this particular officer happened to volunteer when
there was a vacancy at that spot _ volunteered for that.
   And I think we have to have the confidence _ and I do have the
confidence in men like him that someone would have a hard time
getting secrets that could harm this country from a person of that
kind.
   Q. Mr. President?
   A. No, I was _
   Q. Mr. President, to follow up on Bill's question earlier,
Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk this morning called your
administration the sleaziest and most corrupt in recent American
history. Even if you have full confidence in people like Ed Meese,
that they will be cleared, do you have any concern that all these
charges and all these investigations are going to be used
effectively by the Democrats against all the Republican candidates
in 1988?
   A. I don't know whether they're going to be used effectively or
not.
   I know they're going to be used; they have been for quite some
considerable time now.
   As a matter of fact, if anyone listened for more than 15 minutes
to their candidates, he would decide that we're in an economic
slump, we're burdened by inflation, high interest rates and
unemployment, when, at the moment, none of those things are true.
   And we have a higher percentage of our potential employee pool
employed than ever in our history, and are continuing the longest
expansion, economic expansion in our history.
   And tomorrow morning, I think you'll find a little good news,
along about 8:30 a.m. tomorrow morning, is going to be released
with regard to the economy.
   So I just think that, you know, the kids will play _ (laughter)
_ and as long as they want to do that, but I hope it'll easily be
forgotten.
   Q. Mr. President, the budget that you have proposed to Congress
would cut _ would eliminate three housing programs for the
homeless. It would make deep cuts in an emergency food program, and
it would end a job training program for the homeless. Do you
believe that the problem of the homeless is less pressing now than
just a year ago when you signed legislation from Congress to create
these programs?

<HEAD>WASHN: these programs?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A. No, but I do know that we're doing a great many things and we
also are keeping track of the extent to which the private sector is
joining in and helping on this, and this budget is the result of
long, long weeks of negotiation with the Democrats and ourselves,
and I think that we're meeting the problems.
   Again, I also have to say this _ that sometimes, our budget in
programs can reflect another program we've had going, which is a
management program, and we have had a team for a considerable
period of time now that has been actually investigating the
management practices of government programs as compared to the way
they're done in the private sector.
   And there are millions and millions of dollars that are being
saved so that something that maybe looks smaller does not mean that
the people in need are going to get less, it means that we're able
to provide that with less administrative overhead.
   When I came here from a governorship, as a governor, I had seen
federal programs administered in our state in which it was costing
the federal government $2 for every dollar that reached a needy
person.
   This is something we've been trying to change, and we've made
some progress in it.
   Q. Mr. President, just to follow up on the budget, the chairman
of your Council of Economic Advisers told us last week that the
deficit might have a good side if it forces your successor and
Congress to make choices in social programs _ do you _ is that _ do
you see a good side to the deficit?
   A. I have said that I think that there is a great reform that is
needed throughout many of those programs, and it is a reform to
where we can get these programs to where their goal will be to
remove people from dependency and make them independent of
government help instead of doing what we've been doing for too many
years now, and that is, actually involving them in dependency to
the place where they never can get out _ we've made them
permanently dependent on government _ and we're trying to change
that, correct that.
   Q. Thank you.
   A. Thank you, Helen. I'm going to run for it now.

<HEAD>By GEORGE GEDDA</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan says the Nicaraguan
government, emboldened by House rejection of more aid to the Contra
rebels, now appears determined to ``crush its opposition and
threaten its neighbors.''
   At a news conference Wednesday night, Reagan said the House
rejection of his $36.2 million Contra aid proposal removed the
pressure on the Sandinistas and encouraged them to reject a
cease-fire proposal offered by a mediator during peace talks in
Guatemala City.
   In addition, he said that while Congress was voting to withdraw
support from the Contras, the Soviets have doubled military aid to
the Sandinistas this year compared with a comparable period in 1987.
   The Nicaraguan Embassy took immediate exception to Reagan's
allegation that the Sadninstas had rebuffed the cease-fire
proposal. It maintained the government had ``responded positively
to the proposal, saying that it was constructive and that it had
several points we could work with.''
   Reagan ``misstated the truth,'' said Embassy spokeswoman Sarali
Porta, accusing the administration of harboring ``a commitment to
prevent the achievement of a cease-fire.''
   Reagan spoke shortly after Rep. Tony Coelho, D-Calif., disclosed
that a vote on a ``humanitarian'' aid package for the Contras,
originally scheduled for today, will be postponed until next week.
   He said House members had asked for a delay to allow them more
time to evaluate a Democratic plan and a rival Republican proposal.
   The $30.5 million Democratic package included $14.6 million for
food, clothing, medicine and shelter for the rebels and a like
amount for medical aid for children who are victims of Nicaragua's
seven-year civil war.
   The plan's author, Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., said it had the
tacit approval of Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, author of a
Central America peace initiative. Coelho predicted victory for the
proposal by a comfortable margin.
   Republicans criticized the Democratic plan as too weak to keep
the rebels alive as a fighting force. They proposed an alternative
that would keep the CIA in business as the delivery agent for the
aid, and give Reagan a chance to trigger a guaranteed vote on
further military help for the rebels sometime after May 1.
   The Democratic plan would put responsibility for delivery of the
aid in the hands of the Defense Department, which would presumably
enlist private contractors to continue air drops to the rebels
similar to those now supervised by the CIA. It would bar any
delivery of weapons.
   At his news conference, Reagan expressed a strong opposition to
direct deliveries by the U.S. military.
   ``You would be putting our military into a combat situation and
this is what we've been trying to avoid in Central America all the
way,'' he said.
   The cease-fire proposal Reagan said the Sandinistas had rejected
called for the Contras to accept a truce in exchange for four major
political concessions by the government, including unrestricted
press freedom and a total, unconditional amnesty.
   It was not clear why Reagan had said the Sandinistas had
rejected the proposal. On Monday, the State Department stopped
short of making that accusation, saying only that a Sandinista
delay in responding to the proposal had prompted the mediator,
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, to suspend the talks.
   On Saturday, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega had said the
Cardinal's proposal ``was not rejected.''

   The effort by Secretary of State George P.
Shultz to revive America's Middle East peace campaign has been
greeted by a chorus of skepticism and scorn from Arab commentators.
   A successful visit could trigger a final effort by the outgoing
Reagan administration to champion Arab-Israeli peace talks.
   But Shultz's tour, which begins today, seems just as likely to
inflame Israeli-Palestinian violence in the occupied lands, where
leaflets distributed last weekend called for massive protests
against Shultz.
   Rarely in recent years has a ranking U.S. official on a Middle
East peace mission faced such universal public skepticism in the
government-influenced Arab press.
   ``These trips will bring no results,'' said Egyptian columnist
Moussa Sabry, who is close to President Hosni Mubarak.
   Syria's state-run Damascus Radio branded Shultz's visit
``nothing but a political airlift to rescue Israel and gain time.''
   An editorial in the English-language Jordan Times said the U.S.
mission has been ``greeted throughout the Middle East with a
combination of skepticism and laughs.''
   Government officials in pro-Western Egypt and Jordan welcomed
the renewed U.S. interest in Middle East peace, spurred by 11 weeks
of Israeli-Palestinian clashes in which more than 60 Palestinians
have been killed.
   But Jordan's King Hussein, increasingly disillusioned with
American policy over the last two years, has not announced plans to
meet Shultz in Amman.
   However, the two could meet in London next week on Shultz's way
back to Washington. Hussein is considered indispensable to any U.S.
plan to end the 40-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Arab leaders generally have become increasingly despondent about
U.S. efforts following the failure of a string of American missions
to the region in the last decade.
   Mubarak warned that the U.S. proposals ``must stay away from any
words or provisions that were in the Camp David agreements'' signed
by Egypt, Israel and the United States in 1978.
   Hard-line Arab states have made it clear they oppose any partial
solutions, such as those the Americans have in mind.
   The U.S. suggestions leaked so far resemble a juiced-up Camp
David: a period of limited self-government for Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip followed by talks on a
final settlement.
   The Arab world is exhilarated by what Palestinians call ``the
uprising'' and Palestinians are in no mood to compromise on their
demand for some form of statehood _ a status no formal American or
Israeli plan has conceded.
   ``The essential quality of the national rights of the
Palestinians ... is not up for bargaining, negotiations or
compromise,'' wrote Jordan Times editor Rami Khouri.
   The Americans have not formally announced their ideas, but what
is known so far leaves some room for negotiation.
   There is no word of conditions for talks on a final settlement,
supposed to start by December. U.S. officials have not defined the
international conference they say could launch Arab-Israeli talks
in April.
   Arab states insist on a conference attended by all parties to
the conflict, as well as the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council, and talks aimed at a final _ not interim _
solution.
   But Shultz's ability to compromise is limited by Washington's
ally, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who resists calls to
accelerate the Camp David process or to surrender the occupied
territories, a universal Arab demand.
   The Palestinian unrest has reasserted the Palestine Liberation
Organization's role as their spokesman, damaging U.S. and Israeli
efforts to find ``alternative'' Palestinian leaders to talk with.
   The growth in PLO prestige occurs just as the United States is
trying to defy the United Nations by forcing closure of the PLO
mission to the world body in New York.
   The PLO returned the American snubs by ordering Palestinians in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip to boycott the Shultz visit,
threatening to rob Shultz of contact with the people at the heart
of the conflict.
   The PLO's increased strength, coupled with Washington's refusal
to meet with it, bolsters the Middle East role of the Soviet Union,
a staunch backer of the organization.
   At the same time, the shift of the conflict to one between
Israelis and Palestinians has moved America's main Arab friends,
Egypt and Jordan, a few steps toward the sidelines.
   The result makes it more difficult for the Americans and
Israelis to prevent the Soviets from taking a role in any peace
talks, something the United States has accepted grudgingly and
Shamir still rejects.

   New screening techniques to further safeguard
blood donations from the AIDS virus are being studied by the
American Association of Blood Banks.
   The AABB announced Wednesday that the new study was prompted by
reports that ``have raised concerns about the safety of blood
transfusions administered to over 4 million people in the United
States annually.''
   A study published Feb. 25 in the New England Journal of Medicine
traced 13 units of blood infected by the AIDS virus back to seven
people who donated blood even though they had been recently exposed
to the virus.
   Blood banks and hospitals routinely test donated blood for the
human immune virus which causes AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency
syndrome. But the HIV tests are able only to detect antibodies
which may not develop until long after the exposure to the virus.
The AABB said Wednesday its study will test for the HIV antigen, a
marker that may appear in the blood of an infected person before
the antibodies.
   ``The results of this study will determine if an antigen test
would be useful in detecting individuals in early stages of
infection who donate blood,'' the statement said. It added that no
tests for the antigen have yet been licensed.
   Dr. Paul J. Schmidt, the AABB president, said current tests are
``nearly'' 99 percent sensitive, but do not detect people recently
exposed to HIV.
   ``We expected that there would be some infection developing in
transfusion recipients,'' he said. ``We are working on solutions to
the problem of detecting persons even earlier in this infectious
state, and on how to discourage them from donating blood.''
   Schmidt added: ``The risk from not getting a needed transfusion
is infinitely greater than the risk of getting one.''
   AIDS is a fatal disease that is spread most often through sexual
contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood
or blood products, and from infected pregnant women to their
offspring.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control estimates that at least
1,350 Americans have been infected by the AIDS virus from
transfusions of blood or blood products since 1981. About 900
patients have died.
   A rigorous blood-screen program now has reduced the presence of
the virus in blood supplies to an estimated one unit in 50,000.
   As of Feb. 15, AIDS had been diagnosed in 53,814 Americans, of
whom more than half, 30,158, have died, according to the CDC. No
one is known to have recovered from AIDS.
   AIDS kills by destroying the immune system, leaving patients
susceptible to a host of opportunistic infections.
   Blood banks now screen donor candidates for AIDS risk factors,
but the AABB said it would review these procedures to determine if
they should be tightened.
   The AABB is the world's largest organization of blood banks and
transfusion services, with 2,500 members. It accredits blood banks
and transfusion services and sets standards for agencies collecting
nearly half the nation's donated blood.

<HEAD>Fat People Get That Way Because They Burn Up Less Energy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People often grow overweight because their fuel
efficient bodies are better at storing up fat than burning off
calories, not because they are gluttonous slobs, according to
research published today.
   The studies provide scientific backing for an obvious fact of
life for many overweight people: They simply need less food than
their svelte friends.
   Overeating certainly may contribute to obesity, but the two
reports in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrate that
people's metabolisms also play a crucial role.
   In one of the studies, researchers found that fat babies _ all
of whom had overweight mothers _ were already expending less energy
than other infants when they were just 3 months old.
   The other found that grownups with slow metabolisms put on
weight much more quickly than do other people.
   Previous studies have shown that fat people often use up
relatively low amounts of calories when resting. But it was unclear
whether their metabolism was low because they are fat, or whether
they were they fat because their metabolism was low.
   The new work suggests that low metabolism causes obesity, not
the other way around.
   ``It means that some people have to eat less than others to
maintain their weight. It's like they always said, but nobody ever
believed,'' said Dr. Clifton Bogardus of the National Institutes of
Health.
   He said he hopes the research will help convince doctors that
``everyone who is fat isn't that way just because they are
gluttonous slobs. They have something wrong.''
   Bogardus of Phoenix, Ariz., was a co-author of the adult study,
conducted on 221 Pima Indians, who have a high rate of obesity. The
researchers measured their subjects' energy expenditure while
resting and while living for 24 hours in a small room.
   They found that those whose 24-hour energy expenditure was low
were four times more likely than those with high metabolisms to
gain at least 17 pounds during the following two years. They also
found that low and high metabolisms tend to run in families.
   In the infant study, doctors studied six babies who were born to
lean mothers and 12 born to overweight women. They used a newly
developed urine test called the doubly labeled water method to
measure the infants' energy expenditure while living at home.
   At 3 months, all of the babies were normal sized. But by age 1,
six of the fat mothers' babies had become overweight. Total energy
expenditure at 3 months was 21 percent lower in the infants who
later became fat.
   The researchers theorize that these babies have an inherited
tendency to be fat. Their bodies have a high ``set point,'' or
weight goal. They try to reach this point by taking in more energy
or using up less.
   The study's director, Dr. Susan B. Roberts of Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said she believes that the fat babies ate
no more than the normal ones. They therefore put on weight to reach
their set point by being less active.
   ``That would be a logical thing to do in small infants, because
their food intake is largely controlled by their mothers, so they
didn't have the option of going to the fridge and having another
sandwich,'' she said. ``But in adults, who have the option of going
to the fridge, high food intake may also contribute to the
maintenance of being overweight.''
   Dr. William I. Bennett, a diet expert at Harvard Medical School,
said, ``What's being shown here is that there is some broad pattern
of vulnerability to weight gain. They are starting to get awfully
close to showing that there is a set of genes'' that controls
obesity.

<HEAD>Northrop Accused in Suit of Overcharging on Bomber Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has been overcharged more than
$1 billion for development of the Stealth bomber, according to a
lawsuit against Northrop Corp., the company building the secret
plane.
   The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court here on
behalf of four current and former Northrop employees who could
collect part of any damages awarded to the government if the suit
were successful.
   The lawsuit, which was sealed under procedures followed in such
cases, accuses Northrop of double-billing, false billing and
misrepresented charges, said Robert Kilborne, the attorney
representing the employees.
   Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio refused comment, citing a
company policy against responding publicly to lawsuits.
   The Air Force Office of Special Investitations has launched its
own investigation into the allegations, a standard step in such
cases, said Maj. Kathleen McCollom, a spokeswoman for the office.
   Kilborne refused to reveal the names of his clients, identifying
them only as an internal auditor, a former controller, a former
avionics engineer and a former test equipment engineer.
   The lawsuit alleges that Northrop destroyed internal audits that
turned up evidence of improper charges on development of the bomber.
   The plane, dubbed Stealth because it is designed to be difficult
to detect on enemy radar, is under development at the company's
plants in Pico Rivera and Palmdale.
   The audit documented $400 million in overcharges and estimated
those charges amounted to $1 billion by 1987, Kilborne said.
   The Los Angeles Times reported in today's editions the
overcharges alleged in the lawsuit amount to more than $2 billion.
   The lawsuit was brought under the federal False Claims Act,
which allows citizens to sue on behalf of the government and share
in any damage award. The Justice Department must join in the suit
for it to go forward, and the suit remains sealed up to 60 days
while that decision is made.
   It was filed by Kilborne, who with his law partner, Herbert
Hafif of Claremont has brought three other such suits against
Northrop in connection with its work on the MX missile program. In
October, the Justice Department moved to dismiss one of those suits
after failing to substantiate the allegations.

   HISTORY _ Korea's history can be traced to at least the 1st
century B.C. Small, rival kingdoms fought for control of the Korean
Peninsula over the centuries, with China often dominating the area.
Japan seized the country in 1910 and proclaimed it a province.
   U.S. and Soviet forces ended the harsh Japanese colonial
occupation in 1945, dividing the country along the 38th parallel.
South Korea and North Korea were formed and the two nations fought
the Korean War when the communist north invaded in 1950. Forces
from the United States and other nations intervened on the side of
the south as China sent troops to fight with the north and the
Soviet Union provided supplies.
   South Korea and North Korea remain bitter enemies with hundreds
of thousands of troops poised along their border. About 40,000 U.S.
troops remain in the south under a mutual defense pact.

<HEAD>Simon's Illinois Backers Unfazed By Decision To Skip Super Tuesday
Contests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BERNARD SCHOENBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To home-state backers, Sen. Paul Simon's decision
to forgo a big Super Tuesday push has an important virtue _ it
beats seeing him drop out.
   Simon advocates in Illinois contacted Wednesday lauded Simon's
decision to stay in the race following disappointing showings in
the latest contests.
   The Illinois senator announced his new strategy in Washington,
saying that because of a lack of campaign money, there was little
he could do in the 20 states that vote on Super Tuesday, March 8.
   He is on the ballot in all the Super Tuesday primaries, but he
said he will do little or no campaigning in those states _ except
for the nationally televised debates that are a major feature of
the next two weeks.
   And, of course, he'll have a big edge in the Illinois primary,
which is a week after Super Tuesday.
   Simon, meeting here with about 150 supporters, many of them
delegate candidates and elected officials, offered assurances that
he's in the race to stay.
   ``So, there is no misunderstanding, I am on the ballot in every
state. We are in every district, and we are going to contest and
fight for every delegate and every vote,'' Simon said to cheers and
whistles.
   Some of Simon's Democratic rivals suggested that a candidate
who's not campaigning in the Super Tuesday contests poses little
threat.
   ``I have always believed that to win the nomination and to
ultimately win the presidency you can't have a regional strategy
and you can't run in just one part of the country and not others,''
said Rep. Richard Gephardt.
   And Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore, who is concentrating on the
Southern states, was asked whether any contender could afford to
sit out Super Tuesday.
   ``No,'' he said.
   Simon's backers were undaunted, though.
   ``We urged him to take a Midwestern industrial strategy,'' said
state Sen. Vince Demuzio, D-Carlinville, state Democratic chairman.
   Some supporters held out hope that Simon still has a chance to
win the Democratic nomination for president despite the lack of a
first-place finish in any of the early primaries and caucuses.
   Others said Simon has leverage to fashion the party ticket in
case there is no clear winner by the beginning of the Democratic
National Convention in Atlanta _ leverage that would be lost if
Simon were to drop out now.
   Simon himself cited ``growing evidence that for the first time
in recent history there will be no first-ballot winner at the
Democratic convention.''
   One delegate candidate, state Sen. Patrick Welch, D-Peru, also
said some politicians in Illinois, seeking to be Simon delegates
but facing their own races for offices from the county to state
legislative levels, don't want to be embarrassed with losses in the
delegate races.
   ``His (Simon's) campaign recruited a lot of elected individuals
to use their political operations to get Simon elected,'' Welch
said. ``This works both ways.''
   Simon also acknowledged he has had some pressure from Illinois
delegate candidates to stay in the race so they could get to the
convention.
   ``There are people in Illinois who want to go to the convention
and who are Simon delegates,'' he said at a news conference. But,
he said, ``This is not just an Illinois strategy. It is a strategy
to win.''
   State Sen. Dawn Clark Netsch, D-Chicago, said she is among
candidates for Simon-committed delegates who were dismayed when
Simon announced, after a third-place showing in New Hampshire, that
he would drop out of the race if he did not win in either Minnesota
or South Dakota. He later took back that statement and placed
fourth in both races Tuesday.
   Simon came in second in Iowa's Feb. 8 caucuses and third in New
Hampshire's Feb. 16 primary.
   Mrs. Netsch said she knew of no delegate candidate whose only
concern was getting to the convention.
   ``There may be some individuals who feel that way,'' she said,
but ``I can't imagine someone who is angry or upset only because
their ticket to the convention has gone down the drain.''
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., said he had counseled Simon not to
waste resources in the Super Tuesday states.
   ``Whatever he gets (in delegates on) Super Tuesday, fine, but
don't spend any money,'' Dixon said.
   ``I firmly believe that he'll run first in Illinois,'' Dixon
said. ``He'll pick up a large bloc of delegates there, and I think
that will give him a bump _ the kind of a bump that (Rep. Richard)
Gephardt got coming out of Iowa.''
   Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., said Simon's support may have waned but
is still deep. Simon's campaign plunged into debt before the New
Hampshire primary, but he has collected close to half a million
dollars in the past two weeks.

<TEXT>
   A judge deliberated on the 65-year-old
puzzle of President Warren G. Harding's untimely death before
concluding, ``It's a mystery to me.''
   The ``ruling'' by Judge George T. Choppelas came after an
uproarious session Wednesday of the mock Court of Historical
Review, which considered suggestions that Harding's wife killed him
in 1923.
   But the ``spirit'' of Harding's widow, testifying in a
standing-room-only City Hall courtroom, said ``Madame X,'' her
fortuneteller, told her that Vice President Calvin Coolidge killed
the 29th president.
   It was the 50th session of the just-for-fun court that since
1975 has taken up such weighty questions as ``Who invented the
fortune cookie?'' and ``Is chicken soup Jewish penicillin?''
   Harding, whose administration was torn apart by such corruption
scandals as Teapot Dome, died at age 57 on Aug. 2, 1923, in San
Francisco's Palace Hotel. No autopsy was performed, and his body
was whisked back to Washington for burial.
   Attorney Frank Winston, arguing that Florence Harding killed her
husband, opened by ordering the courtroom to pay no attention to
his opponent, U.S. Attorney Joseph P. Russoniello.
   ``We'll set the record straight,'' snarled Winston, drawing
snorts of derision from Russoniello.
   ``Hmmm,'' said the judge, raising an eyebrow.
   ``I stand for truth, justice and the American way!'' announced
the government prosecutor.
   ``History can be tedious at times,'' sighed Choppelas, a
municipal court judge.
   Russoniello, arguing that the widow did not kill her husband,
claimed Mrs. Harding hated Coolidge and would hardly have done
anything to speed him into the presidency.
   Coolidge was ``a scoundrel,'' testified the ``widow,'' played by
attorney Diane Elan Wick, president of the Lawyers Club of San
Francisco.
   Police Chief Frank Jordan, who was ``sworn in'' and promised to
testify truthfully ``to the limit of my instability,'' affirmed
that local officials did not investigate Harding's death.
   ``It's a mystery to me,'' Choppelas concluded.

<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key Nikkei average
closed above the 25,000-point level for the first time since the
October stock crash today, while the dollar rose marginally against
the Japanese yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average rose 132.01 points, or 0.50
percent, in active trading to finish the day at 25,100.66.
   Sato Yamashita of Goldman Sachs in Tokyo said the market was
upbeat, although there was no special driving force behind its
rally.
   ``It's generating its own momentum,'' he said.
   Last October, on the day after a plunge of more than 500 points
in Wall Street's Dow Jones industrial average, the Nikkei index
fell more than 3,800 points, from 25,746.56 to 21,910.08.
   On Tokyo's foreign exchange market today the dollar closed at
128.80 yen, up a slight 0.05 yen from its close on Wednesday. Spot
volume totaled $13.3 billion.
   A dealer at a major commercial bank in Tokyo said Wednesday's
release of fourth-quarter U.S. trade figures showing that the
nation's trade deficit had declined from the previous quarter had
no major effect on the Tokyo market.
   ``Everyone's just ignoring the report,'' he added, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The U.S. foreign trade deficit stood at $40.2 billion for the
October-December 1987 quarter, down $200 million from the
July-September period, U.S. commerce officials said Wednesday. The
trade deficit with Japan, however, increased by $1.3 billion
dollars to $15 billion dollars.

<HEAD>Dole Stumps In South Carolina, Stopover On Road To Super Tuesday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FLORENCE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bob Dole is playing catch-up in South
Carolina and it helps to talk textiles and tobacco and have Strom
Thurmond at his side.
   Hopping from airport to airport on Wednesday, Dole was battling
to become competitive in a state where Vice President George Bush
and former television evangelist Pat Robertson were conceded to
have a large lead.
   In the battle for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination,
South Carolina has a unique role. Its primary is March 5, three
days before Super Tuesday when Republican voters in 17 states will
express their presidential choices in primaries or caucuses.
   ``The threshold to Super Tuesday,'' was how the Kansas senator
referred to South Carolina at Columbia, his first stop.
   Each of Dole's four stops followed the same pattern.
   First, his state campaign chairman introduced Thurmond, the
state's senior senator.
   ``In the beginning, I thought I'd remain neutral,'' said
Thurmond, describing all the Republican candidates as ``friends of
mine.''
   But, he went on, ``people came to me and wanted to know where I
stood.''
   So this week he announced he was supporting Dole.
   Thurmond called Dole ``the head man among the Republicans in the
Senate,'' a man who rose from humble beginnings, the son of
hard-working parents.
   ``In other words,'' he told people crowded into the Florence
airport ``they're not of the so-called elite, they weren't born
with silver spoons in their mouths.'' That's the kind of reference
Dole often uses to contrast his background to that of Bush.
   Thurmond found other, more practical aspects of Dole's
background to recommend the Kansan to South Carolina voters.
   ``Bob Dole supported the textile bill,'' said Thurmond, pointing
out that 300,000 textile industry jobs across the country had been
lost to foreign competition and that 126 textile plants had closed
in South Carolina.
   The South Carolina senator said that 45 percent of the jobs in
his state were in the textile industry.
   The legislation he referred to would limit imports.
   ``We have a textile bill up now,'' he said ``and he (Dole) is
obligated _ not obligated _ he has promised to support that and we
are proud of that.''
   As Republican leader of the Senate, Dole can play a significant
role in determining whether textile import legislation can come to
a vote in Congress, certainly more of a role than Bush or Robertson
could hope to play.
   Florence also is tobacco country and Dole was asked his view on
tobacco subsidies.
   He talked about his role in passage of the current subsidy
program which he described as operating at no cost to the taxpayers.
   ``A lot of people think, why are you subsidizing tobacco,'' he
said.
   ``Those people are farmers, too,'' he went on ``and they've got
a right to, make a living. I've supported the tobacco program in
every vote since I've been in Congress and I'm going to continue to
do so.''

   To guarantee the comfort of Secretary of State
George P. Shultz, the holy city saved him the best hotel room in
town, stocked up on exotic fruits and made him chocolates shaped
like the dove of peace.
   A white sculpture of a dove with a 12-foot wing span hangs in
the lobby of Hilton Hotel where the secretary will stay.
   When he arrives today for a five-day Middle East shuttle to
launch a new peace initiative, Shultz will occupy the 20th floor
Royal Suite in the hotel, which dominates the northwestern
outskirts of Jerusalem. His entourage will fill about 160 rooms,
hotel officials said.
   ``When you open the doors leading to the balcony, you see really
a stunning view of Jerusalem, with the whole Old City spread before
you,'' Alon Ben-Gurion, the hotel's deputy manager, told Israel's
army radio.
   Dina Doron, who will be responsible for the reception, said the
rooms have been decorated with orchids and other plants.
   Ben-Gurion said a cook ``was flown from Germany especially for
the occasion to make some sweets, chocolates in the form of doves.''
   ``Shultz ... likes very much seafood, and he usually tries local
dishes, so we brought a selection of Mediterranean fish. He also
likes beer, and usually drinks local beer. During his last visit he
drank (Israeli) Maccabee beer,'' he said.
   ``And, of course, the local fruits, all the exotic fruits that
we have today in Israel, like strawberries, kiwi, and oranges,''
Ben-Gurion added.
   The army radio reported that the hotel's pool has been heated to
the temperature of 79 degrees preferred by Shultz and that several
couples have been invited to play tennis with the secretary of
state.
   But other sights Shultz is likely to encounter in Jerusalem are
bound to be less peaceful.
   Airport police said special riot units were called in and will
stay on duty through Tuesday as Shultz conducts his mission.
   Jerusalem's police force was doubled to 3,000 to forestall
Palestinian protests during the Shultz visit, said city spokeswoman
Sivana Meryn.
   An army spokesman said Israeli police approached the army with a
request for extra manpower in Jerusalem and the military agreed. In
the mixed Arab-Jewish Abu Tor neighborhood, troops were seen
checking the identities of Arab teen-agers.
   It was apparently the first time troops were used in the holy
city since Israel united it after capturing the Arab east Jerusalem
from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.

<HEAD>Test Of Booster's Nozzle-To-Case Joint Called Success</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The space shuttle program took another
step toward America's return to space with the apparently
successful fourth test of a joint on the redesigned booster rocket,
a NASA official says.
   Flaws deliberately built into the nozzle-to-case joint for
Wednesday's test allowed hot gases to reach the joint's primary
O-ring seal. But the O-ring stopped the gases from reaching the
secondary or final seal, said Royce Mitchell, NASA solid rocket
motor manager.
   ``It will prove that we can give up two of our seals, or two of
our lines of defense against this hot gas, and still have a good,
safe motor,'' Mitchell said following the six-second test at Morton
Thiokol Inc.'s Wasatch Operations plant 25 miles west of here.
   ``All indications are it's a good test, but we've got another
couple of these to go and, of course, our next motor test will be
in April,'' Mitchell said, adding that a complete analysis of the
joint's performance was not expected for several weeks.
   The solid-fuel rocket booster has undergone extensive redesign
since the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the shuttle Challenger that
killed the seven-member crew. The disaster was blamed on a faulty
seal in a booster joint that allowed hot gases to escape and ignite
the fuel tank.
   Wednesday's test, delayed two hours by replacement of a computer
board, was the fourth of six Nozzle Joint Environment Simulator
experiments and one of hundreds of booster component tests.
   The initially favorable results showed the shuttle program is
moving slowly but surely toward resumption of flights, Mitchell
said.
   ``We are maintaining our schedule for the August launch of
Discovery,'' he said. ``It's a very conservative approach.''
   The test was designed to evaluate the main seal's ability to
contain any gases that might leak through bonded adhesive
insulation and a rubber-like ``wiper'' O-ring during launch, said
Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab.
   Engineers made a quarter-inch-by-five-hundredths-inch hole
through the insulation and disabled the wiper ring, creating two
flaws that assured a gas path to the primary seal.
   The double defects simulated coincidental manufacturing defects
in the insulation and wiper O-ring, a ``worst possible case'' that
likely could never occur, Raab said. It also subjected the joint to
more severe conditions than previous tests.
   The next test will increase the pressure because the primary
O-ring will be purposely flawed to permit gases to reach the
secondary O-ring, Mitchell said. The final test will simulate
complete failure.
   Engineers concluded after the third nozzle-joint test Oct. 8
that the O-ring system withstood gas pressure after a single flaw
was built into the joint, which connects the nozzle to the body of
the segmented booster rocket.
   However, during a full-scale test Dec. 23, a ``blow hole'' was
detected in the joint's adhesive sealant, a defect NASA had not
built into the test.
   Blow holes can occur during assembly of the 126-foot-long
rocket, ``so it happens here at the factory, if it happens,'' Raab
said.
   While the blow hole was not considered a major problem, the
failure of a nozzle boot ring during the December test prompted
NASA officials to delay the scheduled June 2 resumption of shuttle
flights.
   Raab said the test Wednesday simulated ``the most difficult
portion of the environment for the O-rings, that is the first one
second'' of launch.
   In addition to the final two nozzle-to-case tests scheduled
before shuttle flights resume, NASA and Thiokol will conduct
several more Joint Environment Simulator Tests of the booster
rocket and three more full-scale horizontal tests, in April, June
and July.

<HEAD>Advisory Panel Urges Approval Of Women's Birth Control Device</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The birth control device known as the cervical
cap appears headed for regulatory approval after seven years of
testing.
   The device, already used by women in Great Britain and several
other countries, received the green light Wednesday by the Food and
Drug Administration's Obstetrics-Gynecology Devices Advisory Panel.
   The unanimous recommendation was non-binding, but the FDA
usually follows the advice of such panels of outside experts it
maintains to help assess clinical studies.
   The cervical cap is medically similar to the diaphragms already
used by an estimated 3 million U.S. women, but it was not widely
used in the United States in 1977 when Congress ordered FDA to
strengthen its regulation of birth control and other medical
devices.
   Diaphragms and condoms were given ``grandfather'' FDA approval
at that time without the stringent testing subsequently required of
new medical devices.
   In the testing financed by the National Institutes of Health,
the cap has been available to about 50,000 women in 29 states and
the District of Columbia.
   Rather than covering the entire roof of the vagina as a
diaphragm does, the cap fits over the tip of the cervix and thus
allows for more sensitivity during intercourse.
   Another advantage is that it can remain in place longer than the
diaphragm without additional application of spermicide, which is
recommended for use with the cap as it is with the diaphragm.
   Although many women typically wore the cap for three days at a
time in the clinical trials, the panel decided to recommend that it
remain in place no longer than two days at a time. Similar
recommendations for the diaphragm say it should not stay in place
more than 24 hours.
   The cap was found to be 94.6 percent effective in preventing
pregnancy when worn for every instance of intercourse compared to
96.4 percent for the diaphragm.

<HEAD>Hemlock Society Burns Survey in Which Doctors Admit Euthanasia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Survey forms on which doctors admitted
helping with mercy killings of terminally ill patients have been
burned to protect the doctors from possible criminal prosecution, a
``right-to-die'' group said.
   The survey responses, including 20 signed forms from doctors who
said they had helped patients, were destroyed because of a ``witch
hunt'' for a doctor who described a mercy killing in a medical
journal, said Derek Humphry, executive director of the Hemlock
Society.
   ``Some people have noticed evidence buried in the survey of what
I would call compassionate crimes,'' Humphry said Tuesday. ``We
decided to destroy the evidence before there is any official
inquiry, and therefore not break any law. We would not want to get
these kindly doctors into trouble.''
   The society, which promotes euthanasia, or mercy killing, last
week released results of the survey showing 51 percent of
California doctors responding would practice euthanasia where they
considered it appropriate.
   Asked if they had ever helped a patient die, 79 of 588 doctors
responded positively, and 20 of those put their names on their
responses, Humphrey said. Of those doctors who had taken the life
of a patient, 15 said they had done it once, 35 said they had done
it two or three times and 29 said they had done it more than three
times, he said.
   The society's news release didn't describe how the doctors
surveyed were selected or how representative they are.
   Humphry said concern over possible prosecution was prompted by
calls for criminal charges against a doctor who wrote anonymously
in the Jan. 8 issue of the Journal of the American Medical
Association of a mercy killing.
   The letter to the editor, titled ``It's Over, Debbie,'' prompted
calls for prosecution from New York Mayor Edward Koch among others.
The district attorney in Cook County, Ill., where the journal is
published, is seeking the name of the letter writer, but the
journal has resisted.
   The Hemlock Society, which claims 23,000 members, is based in
Los Angeles.

   Violent Palestinian riots have spilled onto
canvas and into lyrics as many Israeli artists and intellectuals
rebel against government policy in the occupied territories.
   The intellectual rebellion has galvanized the dovish camp but so
far has had no noticeable effect on the middle-of-the road voter
whose support will determine what path Israel follows in the peace
process in elections this November.
   One hundred writers, actors, singers and other well-known
figures in the arts published an advertisement in Israeli
newspapers last week calling for an end to army brutality against
the Palestinians.
   On Saturday, more than 100 artists and photographers are
scheduled to take part in a protest exhibition, many of them
displaying works made since the unrest broke out.
   ``It is not as much the occupation that worries me as what has
happened to us,'' said Nira Yitzhaki, an art gallery owner who is
organizing the exhibition. ``We have lost our humanity.''
   Six art galleries will host the show under the banner: ``We
Favor Immediate Talks With the Palestinians and an End to the
Occupation.''
   Representatives of more than 10 groups of writers, playwrights,
students and university academics are co-ordinating a protest
campaign.
   Playwrights are mounting a vigil outside Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's home, calling for negotiations with Palestinian leaders.
   A growing number of Israelis in the arts, many of them leaders
in their fields, have started to protest the 20-year-long
occupation and the harsh army crackdown on Palestinian
demonstrators.
   According to U.N. figures, more than 60 Palestinians have been
killed since violence began Dec. 8 in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, which Israel captured from Jordan and Egypt during the
1967 Middle East war.
   Some of the more popular entertainers could be putting their
careers on the line by taking sides in Israel's highly polarized
and emotional debate.
   Among them is Cee Heiman, an up-and-coming rock 'n' roll singer
who recently cut her first record.
   During an appearance last Saturday at an avant-garde theatre run
by the left-wing Mapam Party, Heiman sang the first Israeli protest
song of the current Palestinian uprising.
   The song, ``Shooting and Crying,'' has some tough lyrics.
   ``The window in my home is broken and Tel Aviv rushes in,'' sang
Heiman. ``Even its smell has changed. Boys play with lead and girls
with dolls of steel. Life looks different in the shadow of the
filth.''
   ``We shoot and cry, laugh and burn. Whenever did we learn how to
bury people alive. We shoot and cry, laugh and burn. When did we
forget there was a time our children were also killed.''
   But Aharon Appelfeld, a Holocaust survivor and one of Israel's
internationally known writers, said the intellectuals are
contributing to the discord which is ripping Israeli society apart.
   ``Instead of being a moderating influence, the intellectuals are
adding to the extremism,'' he said in an interview. ``I'm very
afraid of the polarization and they keep fanning the flames.''
   Appelfeld, author of such books as ``Badenheim, 1939'' and ``The
Age of Wonders'' said he agreed Israel should not rule over the
Palestinians but disliked the way the intellectuals were presenting
their arguments.
   ``They are saying that in the present situation the Arabs are
the good guys and the Jews the bad ones,'' he said. ``The Arabs
want to negotiate with us and we don't want to. But this is not
true.
   ``Most Israelis feel that the Arabs still do not accept us in
this region,'' Appelfeld said. ``We want to hear voices from the
other side telling us we are welcome, telling us they won't throw
us into the sea.''
   He warned that the arguments used by Israeli intellectuals were
alienating the silent majority of Israelis who strive for peace but
have genuine and legitimate concerns.
   ``The mainly Ashkenazi (European-origin) intellectuals have not
found a way to reach the religious community or the Sephardis (who
come from Arabic-speaking countries),'' Appelfeld said. ``They are
not rabble. They are people with genuine fears and they must be
understood.''
   ``I am very afraid that two large camps may be formed which
could reach the point of civil war,'' said Appelfeld. ``It's our
job not to light that fire. That's a heavy responsibility.''

   David Walter says customers will have
to wade for a table at the restaurant he hopes to moor off this
Gulf Coast resort.
   Walter has applied to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for a
permit allowing him to moor a 50-foot-long oil field jack-up boat
converted into a restaurant and bar.
   The restaurant would sit in the surf within 50 feet of the beach
in about 3 feet of water, he said recently.
   The eatery would be jacked up on four legs and would face the
beach. Customers would wade through the water and walk up a ramp to
enter the restaurant.
   ``You have to wear something you can get wet,'' Walter said.
Shoes aren't required.
   Walter said he expects his customers to be ``the bathing suit
people'' who lie on the beach, and hopes to do business from May 15
to Sept. 15.
   He said the restaurant initially won't be open at night for
safety reasons. He also has yet to work out a menu, but said the
food will be ``nothing elaborate.''
   If the establishment is not successful, Walter said, he can just
``push two levers and move the boat off and drive away.''

   Soviet soldiers have started
loading shorter-range SS-12 nuclear missiles onto railroad cars in
preparation for the rockets' removal from Czechoslovakia, the
official news agency said today.
   The loading was taking place in the Moravian town of Hranice,
the news agency CTK added.
   According to the report, the missiles were transported during
the night from a nearby military zone to the railway station where
the loading operation began.
   Czechoslovakia announced Wednesday that the Soviet rockets would
be removed before the U.S. Congress votes on ratification of the
superpowers' missile treaty signed last December in Washington.
   CTK added that the first of the missiles would leave Hranice for
the Soviet Union this evening.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Dusan Rovensky said Wednesday evening
that under an agreement between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet
Union, ``the withdrawal of Soviet army rocket units armed with
operational-tactical missiles from Czechoslovak territory will
start on Feb. 25.''
   CTK said the removal of the Soviet missiles was being watched by
60 reporters, but it was not known if any Western journalists were
invited.
   A farewell meeting between Hranice citizens and Soviet soldiers
was scheduled for the afternoon, CTK noted.
   Hranice, with a population of 12,500, has been singled out by
Czechoslovak officials as the only place in the country where
Soviet missiles had been stationed.
   ``The step of the Soviet government, the removal of
operational-tactical shorter-range missiles before ratification of
the Soviet-American agreement, is further proof of the sincerity,
concreteness and constructive approach of the Soviet peace policy
to nuclear disarmament and the creation of a more secure world,''
CTK said.
   The withdrawal coincides with the 40th anniversary of Communist
rule in Czechoslovakia.

<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Milos Jakes
condemned the social reforms that were crushed by Soviet-led troops
20 years ago, and said the nation will maintain central planning of
the economy.
   Speaking at a celebration Wednesday marking the 40th anniversary
of the communist takeover in Czechoslovakia, Jakes gave little
indication he is about to favor economic and political reforms
similar to those being tried in the Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary
and Bulgaria.
   The 65-year-old Jakes also ruled out all non-communist
opposition.
   Jakes took over party leadership last December from Gustav
Husak, now 75, who was chairman of the solemn meeting on Wednesday.
   Jakes' hourlong speech to 500 party members in Prague's Hradcany
Castle did not essentially differ from the cautious conservatism
Husak displayed during his 18-year tenure.
   The speech preceded celebrations that will include a mass rally
today in Prague's Old Town Square, scene of a triumphant speech by
then-Communist Party leader Klement Gottwald on Feb. 21, 1948.
   Jakes asserted that an economic restructuring process was under
way concerning ``a new framework of the sphere of action for
central bodies.''
   But he hastened to add, ``These measures are in no way meant as
steps toward weakening the role of the centrally managed economy.''
   He revealed that part of the ministerial bureaucracy will be
reassigned to productive work, and, in an apparent allusion to
reform-minded neighboring Hungary, said: ``There is no threat of
unemployment in Czechoslovakia.''
   Jakes attacked the communists who, under the leadership of
Alexander Dubcek, tried in 1968 to introduce some reforms
resembling those recently instituted or proposed by Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in the Soviet Union.
   As head of the party's chief disciplinary body from 1968 to
1977, Jakes was responsible for purging 500,000 people from the
Communist Party after the invasion. Jakes denied there is a need to
reassess the official view of 1968.
   He also rejected any comparison between Dubcek's reforms and
Gorbachev's innovations. The party chief lauded the ``assistance''
Czechoslovakia received from the Soviet Union and its allies to
obliterate Dubcek's reform efforts.
   The communists received nearly 40 percent of the vote in
elections in 1946, but assumed sole power only after a series of
political maneuvers from Feb. 20-25, 1948. Czechoslovakia was the
last country in Eastern Europe to turn communist, setting the seal
on Kremlin domination of the region.
   ``It was no communist coup, as it's always described by hostile
propaganda,'' Jakes said of the 1948 takeover. ``It was the will of
the people.''
   He also issued a warning to the Charter 77 human rights movement
and other non-conformists who are banned from public life in
Czechoslovakia.
   ``The broadening of democratization in no case means the
creation of space for the legalization of political opposition
which, as all experiences to date show, cannot be other than
anti-Socialist,'' said Jakes.

   Rock 'n' roll singer Frank Zappa has pledged

   The alliance prompted one elderly league member to joke that he

said Pittsburgh League President Marsha Bingler.
   ``I consider that an upbeat comment,'' said Ms. Bingler. ``The
gentleman who said that is about 70 years old. He does have trouble
with his hearing.
   ``I've had no one in the league say anything other than that
this is a worthwhile effort,'' she said. ``The league encourages
the widest participation in the electoral process.''
   Zappa said 400 people registered at his recent concert in
Boston, and about 380 registered at a stop in Hartford, Conn.
   ``The only way to change what is going on is to vote,'' he said.
``Unless young people get involved, their decisions will be made by
people older than them who don't know or don't care.''

<HEAD>Judge Orders April 15 Ban on Termite Pesticides Chlordane,
Heptachlor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has told the Environmental
Protection Agency it has until April 15 to ban the sale and
commercial use of products containing an anti-termite pesticide
believed to cause cancer.
   U.S. District Judge Louis Oberdorfer ruled Wednesday that the
EPA had acted illegally by allowing 197 holders of federal
pesticide licenses to sell existing stocks of products containing
the pesticides chlordane and heptachlor.
   Oberdorfer said the EPA failed to take into account whether
continued sale or use of the products ``would pose any unreasonable
risk to man or the environment.''
   Last year, Velsicol Chemical Corp., the nation's only
manufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor, agreed to stop selling
the chemical while it tries to find an acceptable method of
applying the pesticide.
   But the EPA's agreement with Velsicol did not cover products
containing chlordane made by other companies for the retail market.
   The agency estimates these companies have 1,700 pounds of
chlordane products in their stocks compared with the 110,000 pounds
in Velsicol's inventory.

   A federally imposed waiting period for
would-be gun buyers would save lives by letting violence-prone
customers cool down, say olice officials.
   Representatives of national, state and local police Wednesday
urged the House Judiciary subcommitee on crime to advance
legislation requiring a waiting period after any request to buy a
handgun.
   The crime panel is considering a number of bills that would
require a delay of at least seven days between the time a buyer
enters a gun store and when the customer gets the weapon.
   Also under consideration are plans to require background checks
of would-be buyers, including comparison of their fingerprints to
FBI records.
   Both ideas were strongly opposed by pro-gun groups and some
members of Congress as ineffective against violent crimes and
unfair to legitimate gun buyers. The National Rifle Association
called the plan ``irrelevant, useless, costly and
unconstitutional.''

<HEAD>Filing Tax Forms Through Computers Speeds Returns, IRS Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 1 million taxpayers will receive federal
refunds as much as three weeks earlier this year by having a
professional file their tax returns directly into the IRS computer.
   Already this year, 119,494 returns have been filed
electronically _ compared with 77,612 for the entire filing season
in 1987. If the taxpayers choose, their refunds will be deposited
directly into their bank account.
   Although the number of electronic returns are up considerably
this year, the volume of ordinary, paper returns filed so far is
6.7 percent below last year's pace. However, the gap _ which
officials blame partially on the new tax law _ is closing each week.
   Through Feb. 19, the Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday,
23.55 million returns had been filed, compared with 25.24 million a
year ago. The IRS has processed 9.74 million of this year's
returns, up slightly from 9.72 million last year.
   The inventory of unprocessed returns totaled 13.8 million last
week, compared with 15.5 million a year ago.
   The average refund is bigger this year: $782 compared with $727.
By the time all 107 million individual returns are filed this year,
the IRS estimates, nearly 80 percent will qualify for refunds
averaging about $1,000.

<TEXT>
   The election of a dynamic tycoon as
president and a thaw in Greek-Turkish relations has raised hopes
for a settlement of ethnic disputes on this Mediterranean island.
   The Cyprus question has long soured relations between Greece and
Turkey, two NATO allies, posing a potentially serious weakness in
the Atlantic alliance's vulnerable southern flank.
   George Vassiliou, 56, a self-made millionaire, was elected
Cyprus' president for a five-year term Feb. 21. He ran as an
independent with the powerful Communist Party his main backer on a
platform of ``time for change.''
   He vowed to be flexible and work for ``quick results'' to
reunite Cyprus, partitioned since Turkey invaded in 1974 and
occupied the northern third of the island.
   As leader of the 500,000-strong Greek Cypriot majority,
Vassiliou has said he is prepared to meet with Rauf Denktash,
president of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot republic proclaimed in
the north in 1983 and recognized only by Turkey.
   But Vassiliou must overcome deep distrust and military buildups
on both sides which U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
has warned could trigger a new confrontation.
   Vassiliou, a political newcomer, is widely viewed as more
flexible than his predecessor, Spyros Kyprianou. But Vassiliou
remains committed to the withdrawal of some 30,000 Turkish troops
and 50,000 Turkish settlers from the north and the return of
200,000 Greek Cypriot refugees.
   Turkey and Denktash insist the troops are needed to protect the
120,000 Turkish Cypriots.
   Hints by the Turkish government that it might be prepared to
pull out some troops in advance of any agreement fueled hopes of
progress.
   It is not clear what concessions Vassiliou is prepared to make.
   Negotiations under U.N. auspices have been deadlocked for three
years because of Kyprianou's hard line.
   Kyprianou had the rug pulled from under him two weeks before the
election, when Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, who for
years refused to negotiate with Turkey, changed his mind.
   Papandreou conferred with Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal in
the Swiss resort of Davos in late January. The meeting ended with a
``no war'' agreement and an announced determination to settle all
outstanding differences peacefully.
   Apart from the Cyprus problem, what has brought brought Greece
and Turkey to the brink of war repeatedly in recent years is the
issue of territorial waters and underwater oilfields in the Aegean
Sea.
   Greece and Turkey sought to patch together a settlement of the
Cyprus problem in 1958 in what Greek Cypriots refer to as ``the
ignominious, imposed Zurich agreement.''
   This laid the groundwork for independence from Britain two years
later. Under that agreement, the island's constitution gave the
Turkish Cypriot minority, 17 percent of the population, equal
political status with the Greek Cypriots.
   The agreement also made Britain, Greece and Turkey guarantor
powers with the right to intervene.
   That is widely seen by Greek Cypriots as sowing the seeds for
Turkey's subsequent invasion on the pretext of protecting Turkish
Cypriots after a short-lived coup by supporters of union with
Greece plotted with the colonels' junta then in power in Athens.

<HEAD>Relations Getting Worse Almost Day by Day Over Northern Ireland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCUS ELIASON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a prolonged warm spell, relations between
Britain and Ireland appear to be going into a dangerous free fall
over a spate of incidents involving the conduct of British security
forces in Northern Ireland.
   So severe is the strain that fears are being voiced for the
survival of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, the accord that gave
Dublin a say in the running of Northern Ireland and was responsible
for the relative amity that existed between Britain and Ireland
until the beginning of the year.
   The harmony was jolted on Jan. 25. The British government
announced that, having investigated the shooting of six unarmed
Roman Catholics by Northern Ireland police in 1982, authorities
uncovered evidence of a conspiracy to pervert the course of justice
_ yet no policemen would be prosecuted.
   Matters grew worse the same week when a British court rejected
the appeal of six Irishmen who claim they were wrongly convicted of
a 1974 bombing attack in mainland Britain that killed 21 people.
   The Irish government said that despite the ruling, it continued
to believe a miscarriage of justice may have occurred.
   That dispute was quickly followed by a new one as Ireland
accused London of failing to abide by the conditions Dublin has set
for extraditing Irish Republican Army suspects to Britain.
   Next, the British government announced it was making its tough
anti-terrorism law, which requires annual parliamentary renewal,
permanent. Many Irish believe the law tars them with the brush of
the IRA. Only after outcry in Ireland did Britain restore
Parliament's right to review the law annually.
   Tempers grew worse on Sunday when Aidan McAnespie, a 23-year-old
Catholic and supporter of the outlawed IRA's legal political wing,
Sinn Fein, was shot dead from an army observation tower as he was
walking through a security checkpoint on the Ireland-Northern
Ireland border.
   The army expressed regret and the soldier who fired the shot was
charged Wednesday with unlawful killing.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said it was investigating the
shooting, but Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey ordered his own
force to investigate, too.
   This outraged the British, who saw it as a gesture of disdain
for the Royal Ulster Constabulary's efforts. Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher pointedly warned the Irish to keep their
investigation to their own side of the border.
   She also voiced annoyance at Dublin's behavior on the
extradition issue.
   But then, on Tuesday, the army dropped a new bombshell. It
announced that Pvt. Ian Thain, the only British soldier ever jailed
for life for killing a civilian in Northern Ireland, was free on
parole and back in his regiment, having served only three years of
his term.
   Even the conservative Daily Telegraph, which usually takes
Britain's side in disputes with Britain, called it an act of
``stunning insensitivity.''
   Among Northern Ireland's Catholic minority, angry reactions came
not just from Sinn Fein militants, but from moderates like Cardinal
Tomas O Fiaich, head of Ireland's Roman Catholic church. He called
McAnespie's death ``murder,'' and said Thain's release ``add insult
to injury.''
   A British official who spoke on condition of anonymity said the
incidents were ``a spasm'' in Anglo-Irish relations, not a pattern.
He said Britain's critics were failing to take into account that
the security forces in Northern Ireland were up against a terrorist
organization in a civil war that has claimed more than 2,500 lives
since 1969.
   But Merlyn Rees, a former Northern Ireland secretary, warned
that the Anglo-Irish Agreement was ``tottering.''
   In Dublin, the Irish Press commented: ``There is an alarming but
unmistakable pattern emerging from the behavior of the British
government toward our government. It is almost as if it is trying
to provoke Mr. Haughey into a rash decision.''
   So far the Irish prime minister has kept cool and refrained from
anti-British rhetoric. Most important, perhaps, is his clear
determination to carry on fighting the IRA.
   Police have uncovered several large IRA arms caches north and
south of the border, including one on Wednesday night near Dublin
that contained explosives, grenades and two dozen assault rifles.
   The Irish Press editorialized that it was Britain's system of
justice that had alienated Northern Ireland's Catholics and pushed
some of them into the IRA's embrace.
   It was that alienation that was supposed to be tackled by the
Anglo-Irish Agreement, the paper said, adding: ``That hope is
fading by the week.''

   Insurance companies led the gains after Royal Insurance
announced 1987 earnings that were generally better than market
expectations. Royal's pre-tax profit fell 10 percent to 274.0
million pounds in calendar 1987 from 304.8 million pounds the

gained 10 to 330.
   The early trend followed a small gain in New York Wednesday,
where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.83 to 2,039.95, and a
rise in Tokyo overnight, where the Nikkei index climbed 132.01 to

<TEXT>
   Democrat Mike Dukakis and Vice President George
Bush appear to be the favorites in the March 8 Super Tuesday
primary elections and caucuses, according to The Denver Post-Gallup
Poll.
   The poll showed Dukakis as the runaway favorite in his home
state of Massachusetts, with 61 percent of the voters saying they
favor their governor. Thirteen percent said they supported Richard
Gephardt; 7 percent Sen. Paul Simon; 6 percent for Jesse Jackson; 3
percent for Sen. Albert Gore, and 2 percent for Gary Hart,
according to the poll.
   Democrats in the 13 Southern states holding primaries or
caucuses on March 8 give Dukakis 26 percent; Gore 18 percent;
Jackson 16 percent; Gephardt 12 percent; Hart 11 percent and Simon
6 percent, the poll results show.
   The poll showed that while Bush still is the solid GOP favorite
in the South and in Massachusetts, Sen. Bob Dole has made
significant gains during the past month of campaigning.
   Bush is favored by 54 percent of the Republicans most likely to
vote in the Southern states March 8, while Dole has the backing of
33 percent the poll shows.
   The poll was conducted by the Gallup Organization of Princeton,
N.J., on Feb. 19-21 through telephone interviews with 1729
registered Republicans and Democrats in the Southern states,
Massachusetts an Oklahoma.
   In the GOP races, the poll's margin of error was plus or minus 6
percent, and in the Democratic contests, the margin was 5 percent.

   The coordinator of Gary Hart's New York
campaign effort says he is in a race against the clock to get the
former Colorado senator on New York's April 19 presidential primary
ballot.
   ``It's pretty close,'' said John Kaiman. ``The system itself

impossible.''
   Hart was forced out of the presidential race for a time after it
came out that he had spent a weekend in the company of Miami model
Donna Rice.
   To get on the New York ballot, Democratic candidates have until
midnight tonight to get postmarks on petitions containing the
signatures of at least 10,000 registered New York Democrats. At
least 100 signatures must come from each of 17 of the state's 34
congressional districts.
   With New York sending the second largest delegations, after
California, to the national conventions, the state's April 19 could
be crucial to both Democratic and Republican candidates.

presidential primary, said South Dakota Secretary of State Joyce
Hazeltine.
   ``There were definitely statewide problems. Some exit pollsters
thought that they had been mistreated,'' Hazeltine said in a
telephone interview.
   Hazeltine said she was pleased with the number of people who
voted.
   ``I thought it was great,'' she said of the 43 percent overall
turnout.
   Just over 45 percent of the state's 206,585 registered
Republicans and almost 40 percent of the 179,641 registered
Democrats voted Tuesday.

   Illinois Sen. Paul Simon may have bowed out of
Super Tuesday contention in the South, but he hasn't written off
Washington and will make a campaign swing here, according to state
campaign organizers.
   But Jeff Smith, executive director of the Washington State
Democratic Party, said the senator's campaign moratorium could
greatly dampen his chances of doing well here.
   Simon had been seen as No. 2 presidential hopeful in Washington,
behind Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. But with Simon
downplaying Super Tuesday, the race is ``increasingly defined'' as
a strong Dukakis victory, with Simon slipping, Smith said.
   Simon has scheduled campaign appearances in four Washington
cities early next week, and still hopes to come in no worse than a
strong second in the state's March 8 caucuses, insisted state
organizer Beth Doglio.
   Simon announced in Washington, D.C., on Wednesday he is
bypassing the 20-state Super Tuesday, mostly in the South and
border states, because he was low on funds and did not see the
day's caucuses as being decisive or critical.

<HEAD>Robertson Campaign Asks For Vote Recount, Secretary Of State Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pat Robertson, who fell just short of
the threshold needed to win Republican South Dakota delegates, has
asked for a recount of presidential primary votes, according to the
secretary of state.
   Robertson received 18,279 votes or 19.6 percent of the
Republican votes cast in Tuesday's election. A candidate needed at
least 20 percent of Republican votes in order to receive any of
South Dakota's 18 delegates to the Republican National Convention.
   Kansas Sen. Bob Dole garnered 55 percent of the vote, the only
Republican to receive more than 20 percent.
   Secretary of State Joyce Hazeltine said Robertson would need 382
more votes to reach the 20 percent mark.
   Her staff and Attorney General Roger Tellinghuisen are reviewing
South Dakota statutes to see whether a recount is allowed after a
primary election.

<HEAD>Robertson Campaign Will Register New Voters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for presidential hopeful Pat
Robertson says the former television evangelist will try to mold an
Ohio version of his ``invisible army'' through the registration of
new voters during March.
   Ray Jeske, executive director of the Republican's campaign, said
Wednesday the effort will include a mailings, along with direct
appeals to members of about 3,000 Ohio churches. ``March is going
to be voter registration month,'' he said.
   He said there also will be training seminars and other events at
which Democrats will be advised how to cross over and obtain GOP
ballots in order to support Robertson in the May 3 primary.
   However Ohio law will require a strategy adjustment because it
requires voters to register 30 days before the primary. While
registrants do not declare their party affiliations up front, they
later join one of the major parties by requesting its ballot at the
polling place.
   Democrats or Republicans already registered on May 3, as a
result of past voting, can cross over by signing a statement that
they now support the principles of the other party, Jeske pointed
out.
   Robertson claims strong support among Democrats, who apparently
have backed his campaign in other states. In Iowa, for example,
crossover voting, which does not require advance registration, and
what Robertson calls his ``invisible army'' showed up at
neighborhood caucuses to help him finish second.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with comments today from Shamir and
Peres, Shultz saying en route to Jerusalem that Israel's occupation
is the source of violence in territories. TRIMS to tighten. No
pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leaders of Israel's divided coalition
government today argued over how to respond to new U.S. peace
proposals that will be presented during a visit by Secretary of
State George P. Shultz.
   In another development, Shultz today said that Israel's longtime
occupation _ not outside agitation _ is to blame for the violent
unrest now occurring in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``Its fundamental origins are essentially indigenous,'' Shultz
said of the violence.
   He spoke to reporters traveling with him during a refueling stop
in Shannon, Ireland. Shultz was to arrive in Jerusalem later today
for five days of shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East.
   Shultz appeared to disagree with remarks President Reagan made
at a news conference in Washington Wednesday night. Reagan said
some of the violence in the occupied lands was inspired from
outside. The president cited intelligence reports but gave no
details.
   Shultz said the intelligence showed ``a mixed picture'' with
``interaction with outside force.''
   But, he added: ``There is an underlying problem consisting of a
large number of people in occupation who haven't had the basic
rights of governance. So we seek among other things consistent with
Israel's security, to look at things that will help Palestinians
gain legitimate rights.''
   Shultz faces a difficult task in selling his proposals because
Palestinians have refused to meet with him and Israelis are split
over how to make peace with the Arabs.
   U.S. officials and Palestinians say there is little chance
Shultz will meet with Palestinian moderates in Jerusalem because of
a ban imposed by the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Shultz also will have to deal with the sharp differences
separating conservative Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his
liberal political rival, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.
   Speaking today on Israel's armed forces radio, Shamir said
ongoing rioting in the occupied lands will inhibit negotiations.
   ``Certainly what's happening in the West Bank and Gaza doesn't
create the atmosphere for serious political discussions since our
prime attention isn't on these efforts but on easing the situation
and returning the area to a normal life,'' he said.
   Shamir restated his opposition to an international conference to
discuss peace and rejected the land-for-peace formula proposed by
Shultz as a basis for talks. The prime minister made it clear he
would not make concessions under the the pressure of the riots or
diplomatic arm-twisting by the Americans.
   ``I don't think we'll surrender to pressure. And I don't think
someone will be able to achieve something from pressure,'' he added.
   Shamir said only early elections could resolve the division in
Israel on which direction to take in dealing with the Arabs. He
said such elections would be possible in July or August. But he
added: ``We will try to garner from these discussions something
serious that will be able to advance the peace process.''
   In an interview today with Israel Radio, Peres indirectly
attacked Shamir, accusing the Likud Bloc leader of inaction and
stressing the need for Arab-Israeli negotiations as a way out of
the dilemma in the occupied lands.
   ``I think it's wise not to create expectations, but it's not
wise to ignore the need to get out of the present situation. And I
think that without a peace process the situation won't improve but
will get worse,'' said Peres.
   Peres warned Shamir against a policy of ``doing nothing.''
   ``In my opinion, it's a situation that causes the greatest
damage to the state of Israel,'' Peres said. ``The attitude that
nothing is burning. Supporting the status quo. All of the world
against us. Everyone running away (from talks). Where does it
lead?''
   He also rejected Shamir's hints the November national elections
should be advanced.
   ``A renewal of the peace process doesn't depend on advancing the
elections. It's desirable that the elecetions be held when there's
a peace process. In the final analysis, the problem is more of the
state than of the parties,'' he said.
   Without Palestinian participation, the new U.S. peace plan is
also unlikely to have the desired calming influence on the rioting
that began Dec. 8.
   Palestinian notables said they would obey PLO orders and not
meet with Shultz in Jerusalem.
   ``As far as we are concerned, there won't be a meeting. The PLO
has made clear its conditions,'' said Fayez Abu Rahme, a Gaza Strip
lawyer.
   Hanna Siniora, a Palestinian newspaper editor, said the PLO has
sanctioned a meeting in Amman or Cairo.
   A U.S. government source said Shultz refused to meet
Palestinians anywhere but Jerusalem. ``We are not taking directions
from the PLO on how to meet with Palestinians,'' the source said.
``Meeting outside Jerusalem is a no-go.''

<HEAD>Parents Protest Demotion of 250 Students</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A principal decided to get tough and demoted 250
of her elementary school's 830 pupils because of poor reading
skills, but the move outraged many parents in one of the city's
poorest neighborhoods.
   In the third day of a school boycott, angry parents kept about
400 children out of their Beethoven Elementary School classrooms on
Wednesday to protest the midyear demotions to lower grades. Parents
have been teaching the children themselves in a park fieldhouse.
   ``I don't think it's fair to demote the children in midyear,''
said Dorothy Lee, whose 11-year-old son, Alex, was demoted from the
sixth to the fifth grade. ``If she was going to demote them, I
think she should have waited until the end of the year.''
   Principal Grace Dawson said she would try to make her decision
stick.
   ``I took the step because my children were so far behind _ two,
three, four years behind in reading _ that we had to do
something,'' she said.
   ``We had to take a stand that children can't just sit in the
classroom and do nothing.''
   The principal said demoted students were not shifted to other
classrooms but were being taught materials and subjects from the
lower grades.
   In some cases, entire classrooms were being taught at a lower
grade level, Ms. Dawson said.
   The principal appealed to the parents to come in for meetings on
their children's academic problems.
   While some parents ran their makeshift alternative school
Wednesday, about 20 met with Ms. Dawson and another contingent
attended a Chicago Board of Education meeting to protest the
demotions.
   But school board spokesman Bob Saigh said the administration
supports Ms. Dawson. ``Certainly there's support for her because it
appears what she's doing is for the benefit of the students,'' he
said.
   ``There were a number of comments from board members and the
superintendent that the parents must work with the principal to
improve achievement at Beethoven,'' Saigh said.
   Most of Beethoven's students live in the Robert Taylor Homes,
the nation's largest high-rise public housing project, on the
city's South Side.
   Ms. Dawson said the students were demoted Feb. 15 because of low
reading scores on the Iowa Basic Skills Test given last year and on
the Metropolitan Achievement Test given in January.
   ``It's very difficult as a professional educator to sit back and
do nothing when students are so far behind,'' said the principal,
assigned to Beethoven in September.
   The school mailed demotion notices to parents Feb. 9, and Ms.
Dawson invited them to schedule individual conferences.
   About 25 percent of the affected parents met with her, and most
then supported the demotions, she said.
   Children whose parents still had strong objections were returned
to their original class work, Ms. Dawson.
   She said the school has mailed a second notice to parents asking
them to come to the school and talk.
   But many parents objected to having their children demoted in
the middle of the school year. Some predicted it would cause
students to lose interest in education and drop out in later years.
   ``I will never agree to demoting my child,'' said Brenda
Wimberly, whose 9-year-old son, Dontae, was demoted from the third
to the second grade. ``If his reading doesn't come up in April,
then he can remain in the third grade for next year.''

   Protesters today hurled rocks and
firebombs at riot police, while new President Roh Tae-woo promised
during his inauguration to end decades of authoritarian rule and
bring full democracy to the country.
   About 2,000 radical students and dissidents shouting ``Down with
Roh Tae-woo the murderer'' battled police in the center of Seoul
for a second day to protest the inauguration. Police with riot
shields charged the protesters.
   Police said there were injuries on both sides, but had no
figures.
   The general public was barred from the inauguration ceremony in
front ot the National Assembly building and there were no public
celebrations. The invitation-only ceremony was subdued and Roh
received mild applause from the 25,000 guests, most of whom were
officials.
   Roh looked calm and thoughtful as he took the oath of office to
become South Korea's sixth president.
   He vowed to end human rights abuses and dictatorial rule. He
promised sweeping democratic, economic and social reforms to give
all Koreans a voice in society.
   ``The day when freedoms and human rights could be slighted in
the name of economic growth and national security has ended. The
day when repressive force and torture in secret chambers were
tolerated is over,'' Roh said in a speech.
   Outgoing President Chun Doo-hwan, disliked by many Koreans for
his tough authoritarian rule, listened impassively. The two men
embraced at the end of the ceremony and shook hands.
   Roh, taking office in the first peaceful transfer of power in
the nation's turbulent 40-year history, said the time had come for
South Korea to become a full democracy.
   After Roh was sworn in, 1,000 pigeons were released into hazy
winter skies and army cannons fired a 21-gun salute, choirs sang
patriotic songs and a traditional orchestra in red robes played
oriental songs.
   Thousands of riot police and plainclothes agents, anticipating
violence after clashes with students in Seoul and two other cities
Wednesday, stood guard at the inauguration and there were no
incidents.
   But around Myongdong Cathedral, masked protesters pelted riot
police with rocks, bricks and firebombs that exploded in orange
showers of liquid flame, setting several officers ablaze.
   Many students shouted anti-American slogans claiming the United
States had rigged the election that put Roh in power. ``Down with
the U.S.,'' protesters yelled.
   Riot police chased bands of students who blocked main roads and
tied up rush-hour traffic. Clashes were also reported in the
southern cities of Masan, Sunchon, Pusan and Kwangju.
   Hundreds of protesters hurling firebombs set fire to a wooden
arch set up to celebrate the inauguration in Kwangju, site of a
1980 anti-government uprising that was bloodyly suppressed by the
army.
   But onlookers ignored calls by the demonstrators to support
them. Police broke up the protests with a huge show of force and
dozens of students were arrested.
   Roh rode to and from the ceremony in a heavily-guarded convoy.
Detachments of riot police in green combat fatigues and black metal
helmets stood guard in nearby sidestreets.
   Roh appealed to opposition groups to join him in building an
enduring democratic system but warned that the violent,
confrontational politics of the past had to end and he would not
tolerate disorder.
   One of the country's two main opposition parties, the Party for
Peace and Democracy, promptly rejected Roh's peace offering, saying
he had no right to rule and won election with massive fraud.
   Roh won the country's first democratic presidential election in
16 years on Dec. 16 with 36.6 percent of the vote. He defeated
rival opposition candidates Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung, who
split the opposition vote. Kim Young-sam later resigned as
opposition leader.
   Chun, who stepped down at the end of a seven-year term, bowed to
demands for direct presidential elections after massive violent
protests last June.
   In his inaugural speech, Roh said South Korea had to end the
political and regional divisions that have split the nation of 41
million people. He appealed to the nation to bury past hatreds and
strive for reconciliation.
   Many Koreans distrust him because he is a former general and say
he lacks a mandate since he did not win an electoral majority. His
decision to retain hardliners in his Cabinet also has worried
Koreans who want reforms.

   Police today arrested a man who, upset over a
bad haircut, bashed a man over the head with an ashtray, tied him
up and set him and his apartment on fire, authorities said.
   Pedro Ramirez, 26, of Bayshore was arrested today in Suffolk
County, said Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell, a police spokesman. Charges
included attempted murder, arson, and robbery, O'Donnell said.
   Ramirez apparently went to the home of a friend on Monday,
O'Donnell said.
   The friend, whose identity was not released, gave Ramirez a
haircut and Ramirez then ``went nuts,'' O'Donnell said.
   ``He didn't like his haircut, I guess,'' he said.
   Ramirez then allegedly knocked the victim out with an ashtray,
tied him up and set the apartment on fire.
   Firefighters found the man tied to a chair with a blanket over
his head. He was taken to New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center
with burns over 19 percent of his body.
   A hospital administrator said she could not give out any
information about his condition.

   Detective Hans Olvebro believes the
identity of the gunman who killed Prime Minister Olof Palme is
buried somewhere in the tons of documents or megabytes of computer
data in police files.
   ``I am an optimist. We have him somewhere in our material,''
said Olvebro, the third detective to lead the hunt since Palme was
assassinated two years ago.
   But despite 16,000 tips and a $8.3 million reward, police
acknowledge they don't know much more about the killer or his
motive than when they began.
   Olvebro, who took over the investigation earlier this month, is
leading the 35 detectives working full-time on the case. At one
point there were 300.
   The most intensive investigation in Swedish history has produced
several by-products: books, plays, libel suits and, according to a
police spokesman, the solution to several other crimes, including
at least one unrelated murder. He refused to elaborate.
   Palme, a four-term premier, was killed in downtown Stockholm on
a midnight walk home from a movie with his wife, Lisbet, on Feb.
28, 1986. She was grazed by a bullet.
   He was the first Swedish leader to die violently in two
centuries. The assassination rocked the self-image of a nation that
treasures its soft-spoken civility and non-violent character.
   Mourners erected a foot-high mound of flowers on the sidewalk
hours after he died. It has been replenished daily, chiefly with
red roses, the symbol of his Social Democratic Party, and the spot
has become a bizarre tourist attraction.
   The trauma of the killing is fading, judging by the organized
events marking the anniversary. Last year, 10,000 Swedes held a
torch-lit march, but this year the only planned commemoration is by
a few party members holding banners in salute on the site.
   Palme was a high-profile figure at home and abroad. He was an
upper-class boy turned Socialist and an international disarmament
activist who was often perceived as having a pro-Soviet slant.
   ``A political murder or the murder of a politician is always
more difficult to solve,'' said Ingvar Eriksson, spokesman for the
investigating team.
   The list of suspects ranges from right-wing extremists who
objected to Palme's socialism to Kurdish terrorists, said to be
outraged at Sweden's refusal to grant refugee status to one of
their leaders.
   The ousted president of Iran, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, claimed the
killing was ordered by the regime of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
because Palme had discovered and tried to stop Swedish arms
smuggling to Iran. Bani-Sadr offered no evidence to support his
claim.
   Two policemen are suing a Swedish television producer for
writing in a book that he saw them acting suspiciously immediately
after the killing. The officers were cleared by a parliamentary
commission.
   One man who was arrested for one week in 1986 won $30,000 in
damages from a major daily after it published his name and picture.
Under Swedish press laws, suspects cannot be identified until their
conviction.
   The same man was detained again a few weeks ago and questioned
for two days. This time, no paper published his name.
   Olvebro's predecessor, Detective Superintendent Inge Reneborg,
said when he left the investigation last month that he believed the
killing was the work of an organization rather than an individual.
   Reneborg left to go into retirement. The first chief
investigator, Hans Holmer, was forced to step down when the case
foundered after a year.
   Official reports have charged that the police work was sloppy
during the crucial first 12 hours after the killing, and that the
probe was hampered by Holmer's refusal to let prosecutors lead the
chase.
   Hoping to find a defector among those involved in the killing,
the government raised the reward tenfold last November, advertising
the prize in the international press.
   Spokesman Eriksson said one source of tips in the case has been
the Swedish underworld, which found the heat too intense from the

   Despite frustrations, Eriksson said, the search for the killer
will go on, if necessary, for another 23 years until the statute of
limitations takes effect.

<HEAD>Iran Reports Fighting In Northeast Iraq; Iraq Denies It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran said its Revolutionary Guards
destroyed 14 Iraqi military bases near the northestern Iraqi oil
city of Kirkuk, then crushed an Iraqi counterattack. Iraq denied
there had been any fighting.
   Iran said the guards were assisted in the military operations
Wednesday and today by guerrillas fighting the Iraqi government and
by Kurdish rebels.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said the raiders
killed or wounded 500 Iraqi troops in the area 50 miles southeast
of Kirkuk, a major oil center located 110 miles northeast of the
Iraqi capital of Baghdad.
   Iraq denied fighting occurred in the area. The official Iraqi
News Agency quoted a military spokesman as saying the claim that
hundreds of Iraqis were killed or wounded was ``a new lie which
will be added to many other lies.''
   The Iranian agency said the Iraqi counteroffensive failed and
the Iraqi troops were forced to retreat. It said the guards, the
Iranian-backed Iraqi Moslem guerrillas and the Kurdish rebels
destroyed 14 Iraqi military bases and seized several strategic
heights near Kirkuk.
   The location of the attack, and its apparently modest scale,
indicated it was not the major offensive Western military analysts
had expected Iran to launch this winter. Iran and Iraq have been at
war for more than eight years.
   The analysts say Iran is facing difficulties recruiting enough
volunteers for the front. They say only 150,000 Iranian warriors
were massed on the southern border, at least 100,000 less than
earlier estimates.

<HEAD>Dollar Slightly Higher In Thin Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar edged higher in thin European
trading today as the market waited for the release of revised U.S.
economic growth figures for the fourth quarter of 1987.
   Gold prices were slightly lower following heavy falls on
Wednesday.
   Dealers said they hoped the gross national product figures,
scheduled for release later today, would give some new direction to
the market and lift it out of the doldrums.
   ``A good GNP figure would reduce worries about the U.S. economy,
but it wouldn't change the fundamental (negative) picture,'' one
dealer at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt said.
   Other dealers said they don't expect more than a short burst of
activity from the GNP figures.
   ``Indicators have been mostly ignored recently,'' a Frankfurt
dealer said. ``Beside the trade figures, nothing is really
important.''
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's business
day begins, the dollar rose 0.05 yen to a closing 128.80 yen.
Later, in London, it climbed to 129.02 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late
Wednesday's rates:
   _1.6968 West German marks, up from 1.6925
   _1.3965 Swiss francs, up from 1.3908
   _5.74145 French francs, up from 5.7240
   _1.90375 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8990
   _1,249.50 Italian lire, up from 1,246.25
   _1.2658 Canadian dollars, up from 1.2651
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.76135 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.7640 late Wednesday.
   Bullion dealers said gold remained weak after falling through
several technical resistance points on Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $433.20 a troy ounce and
at mid-morning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $433.95. Both were down from Wednesday's late
bid of $434.70.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $433.40, down from $434.70 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $7.85 to close at a bid $436.35.
   Silver was quoted in London today a bid price of $6.20 a troy
ounce, down from Wednesday's $6.26.

   Undersecretary of State Michael
Armacost today discussed with Pakistan's president recent moves
toward a Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, officials said.
   Armacost also met for nearly two hours with Afghan Moslem
guerrilla leaders in Pakistan in what a U.S. Embassy official said
was a ``frank and open'' exchange Wednesday.
   He was scheduled to travel next to India for similar talks
before flying back to Washington.
   Armacost's swing through the region follows Secretary of State
George P. Shultz' trip to Moscow this week, where Shultz discussed
the Soviets' pledge to begin leaving Afghanistan by May 15,
depending on the outcome of the next round of U.N.-sponsored peace
talks in Geneva.
   Pakistan, a participant in the Geneva talks, has added a
condition that a military settlement to the fighting in Afghanistan
be coupled with a political settlement to ensure Afghan stability
during a Soviet troop pullout.
   Washington has said only that a political solution would be
``desirable'' and indicated it is willing to settle for an
agreement on a timetable for a Soviet pullout in exchange for a
halt in U.S. military aid to the guerrillas.
   The rebel alliance, under Chairman Yunis Khalis, reportedly
reiterated its vow to Armacost that the guerrillas will continue
fighting until they install themselves as an all-Moslem government
in Kabul.
   One of the more extremist resistance leaders, Gulbaddin
Hekmatyar of the Hezb-i-Islami party, on Wednesday accused
Washington of betraying the guerrilla cause by striking a secret
deal with Moscow on ending the war.
   Pakistani President Mohammad Zia ul-Haq has said Pakistan will
not sign any accord with the present Kabul government, headed by
communist leader Najib.
   Pakistan, in addition to serving as headquarters for the
guerrillas, also shelters about 3.5 million refugees from the
9-year-old Afghan civil war.
   The past weeks have seen hectic diplomatic activity in all
countries involved in the Afghan conflict to prepare for the next,
and possibly final, round of Geneva talks between Pakistan and
Afghanistan, scheduled to begin March 2.

   Magistrates fined an unemployed

into England.
   Linda Squire, 21, hid the 5-week-old black and white rodent in
her sweater during the 32-hour flight from Perth, Australia, to
London.
   She did not declare the rat to customs officers at London's
Gatwick Airport, and police later arrested her at her home in
Dawlish in southwest England, said prosecutor David Bick.
   Miss Squires bought the rat in a Perth pet shop for $2.60 at the
end of an 11-month trip to Australia.
   Because she could not afford to put it in quarantine for the
mandatory six months, the rat was cremated by a local vet.

<HEAD>7 of 8 Convicted in Westies Racket Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The racketeering conviction of seven members of
the Westies has put the murderous Manhattan gang out of business, a
federal prosecutor says.
   A federal jury convicted the seven Wednesday of taking part in
the Westies' violent dealings, including seven murders, three
attempted murders and four kidnappings.
   An eighth defendant was acquitted of all charges, but still
faces a state murder charge in an unrelated case.
   In addition to racketeering, several of the seven, including
Westies boss James ``Jimmy'' Coonan, also were found guilty of
various crimes ranging from attempted murder and loansharking to
drug dealing and tax evasion.
   But the key verdict was the jury's decision that the Westies did
exist, that it constituted a racketeering enterprise and that the
convicted defendants had participated in activities to further the
gang's criminal goals.
   ``The group has been incapacitated and put out of business,''
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary Lee Warren.
   During the nearly five-month trial, defense lawyers contended
there was no such organization as the Westies. Even former gang
members testifying for the prosecution conceded the name
``Westies'' was created by the police and the news media to
describe Irish-American hoodlums on Manhattan's West Side.
   Ms. Warren and the other prosecutor, David Brodsky, claimed the
six men and two women on trial were the violent core of the
Westies, which seized control of a neighborhood once known as
Hell's Kitchen on the edge of Manhattan's theater district near
Times Square.
   For 20 years, they claimed, the gang maintained its rule ``with
horrible and ghoulish acts of murder.''
   Witnesses testified that in at least three murders, the victim's
body was cut up and disposed of in what Ms. Warren called ``the
nightmarish signature crime of the Westies.''
   Most of those murders and murder plots were not separate charges
in the indictment, but listed as acts in furtherance of the
racketeering enterprise. To be convicted of racketeering, each
defendant had to have committed at least two of the 28 racketeering
acts charged.
   The 14-count indictment also listed 10 alleged co-racketeers who
were not named as defendants because they had been slain.
   Several witnesss also testified that the Westies forged an
alliance with the Gambino organized crime family, said to be the
largest, most powerful Mafia group in the country.
   The verdict was reached on the eighth day of deliberations.
   Coonan was convicted of attempted murder, murder conspiracy,
loansharking, extortion and income tax evasion, among other crimes.
His wife was convicted of loansharking and tax charges.
   The jury also found that Coonan participated in most of the
racketeering acts charged against him, including seven murders.
   ``A trial on any single act in this indictment would have
resulted in an acquittal,'' said his lawyer, Gerald Shargel. ``It's
just a matter of the government, piling it all together. That's the
nightmare of RICO (the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations
Act).''
   In addition to Coonan and his 44-year-old wife, Edna, both of
Hazlet, N.J., the others convicted of racketeering and racketeering
conspiracy were: William ``Indian'' Bokun, 30; James ``Jimmy Mack''
McElroy, 42; Richard ``Muggsy'' Ritter, 50; Thomas Collins, 53, and
his wife Florence, 52, all of Manhattan.
   Only John Halo, 36, of New York was acquitted on all charges. He
still faces trial for the June 1985 fatal shooting of his
21-year-old nephew.
   U.S. District Judge Whitman Knapp scheduled sentencing for April
18. All seven face up to 20 years apiece on both racketeering and
racketeering conspiracy.

   The villagers in Karaga fled when police sent reinforcements

   Police found the bodies of police inspector P.C.K. Dotsey and
Sgt. Mandoh Kokomba, who were killed Saturday when a police squad
arrived for talks with village elders and to arrest several
villagers for recent assaults against police officers, the radio
said.
   It quoted Kwesi Nkansa, the northern region police commissioner.
   The radio did not give details about the chieftaincy dispute, or

   Nkansa told Ghana radio that only one villager, a man in his
70s, was arrested and 15 others were being sought.

   A man who said he put a rattlesnake over
the shoulder of a 21-month-old girl to show her it would not hurt
her was convicted of manslaughter in the child's death from
snakebite.
   Darrell Wessendorf, 24, faces a possible one- to 15-year prison
sentence for the May 8, 1987, death of Stevie LuRen Kirkwood of La
Verkin.
   Wessendorf had been charged with second-degree murder, which
carries a possible sentence of five years to life. He had pleaded
innocent by reason of insanity.
   Wessendorf had caused a ``grave risk of death'' by bringing the
snake so close to the girl and ``engaging in activities that
eventually caused the reptile to bite the child,'' District Judge
J. Phillip Eves said Wednesday.
   Wessendorf, a former Page, Ariz., resident, said he was trying
to show the girl that the snake would not hurt her when it bit her
on the shoulder.
   He said he showed her the snake that he had found on a nearby
road and partially placed it over her shoulder. The child's mother
entered the room and screamed, causing Wessendorf to flinch and the
snake to bite the child, he said.
   Defense attorney J. MacArthur Wright argued that only 0.2
percent of those bitten by rattlesnakes die and that those bitten
often are not treated. He said the judge had to ``make a
distinction here on what constitutes a grave risk of death.''
   Eves set sentencing for April 11.

   An 84-year-old woman was killed when a
stray bullet from youths target-shooting nearby shattered her
kitchen window and struck her in the chest, authorities said.
   Neighbors expressed anger that the youths were allowed to go
free after the shooting.
   Rose Cudigan died at AMI Valley Medical Center in El Cajon less
than two hours after being shot Wednesday morning. Her husband,
Raymond, who was standing near her in the kitchen when she was
struck, was not injured and summoned help.
   Three youths admitted they had been target shooting with a .22
caliber rifle about 100 yards away from the Cudigans' home in the
Lakeview neighborhood of Lakeside, said San Diego County sheriff's
Sgt. Danny Goodrich.
   No charges were filed pending further investigation, and the
teen-agers later were released to the custody of their parents.
   ``I'm mad and I'm bitter,'' neighbor Sharon Dudley said. ``We've
lost a wonderful neighbor and the suspects are free.''
   Neighbors said youths had fired guns in the area before.
   ``The (deputies) told me they had no evidence, that I'd have to
get a restraining order against those boys to stop them from firing
their guns. What good is a piece of paper?'' Dudley said.
   Lt. Bill Baxter said the entire case may ``simply be handed to
the district attorney for a review and final determination on any
charges.''
   Under the state penal code, discharging a firearm at an
inhabited dwelling is a felony, punishable by three, five or seven
years in state prison, or by six months to a year in county jail.

   Secretary of Education William J. Bennett said
today that college entrance test scores ``are in a dead stall'' and
the public is still not getting its money's worth from the schools.
   ``In saying that I am disappointed, I think I speak for the
American people,'' said Bennett in his annual report card on the
states.
   Bennett was delivering that verdict at a news conference where
he was also releasing two wall charts nearly six feet wide crammed
with statistics ranking the states on test scores, dropout rates,
how much they pay teachers and other measures.
   It was the fifth straight year that an education secretary has
released the controversial wall charts. Bennett's predecessor, T.H.
Bell, initiated the practice.
   John Weiss, executive director of FairTest, a Cambridge, Mass.,
group that is critical of standardized tests, said, ``It makes no
sense to use a faulty thermometer to measure the nation's
educational health.''
   Bennett said the school reform movement is alive and yielding
positive results in some states, but ``there is still too much
resistance to sensible and needed reform,'' including
accountability measures and merit pay.
   This year, for the first time, the wall chart includes a list of
seven states (Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, Ohio, South
Carolina and Texas) with laws allowing state officials to intervene
in ``academically bankrupt'' school districts.
   It also lists the percentage of high scorers on the Scholastic
Aptitude Test and American College Testing program, and the
percentage of high school graduates who took Advanced Placement
exams.
   The college entrance test scores were not new. They were made
public last fall.
   Bennett lamented that they ``are in a dead stall. The 1987
scores are basically unchanged from last year. The ACT average
dipped by 0.1 point to 18.7, and the SAT remained the same _ 906.''
The ACT is graded on a scale of 1-36 and the SAT on a scale of
400-1,600.
   Bennett said the graduation rate from public high schools
slipped from 71.7 percent in 1985 to 71.5 percent in 1986. No
figure was available for private schools.
   ``All of this is not particularly good news,'' said Bennett, who
recently began his fourth year as ecretary of education. But he did
find some encouraging signs.
   ``Last year a greater proportion of students took the ACT and
SAT tests and the Advanced Placement exams than ever before,'' he
said. That ``means we are succeeding in keeping scores level
despite a larger pool of test-takers.''
   The percentage of high school graduates taking Advanced
Placement tests has doubled since 1982, from less than 5 percent to
nearly 10 percent. Minority participation has grown by 78 percent
since 1984, double the increase among whites.
   Test results ``show that poor, black and Hispanic children are
performing better,'' said Bennett, although there is still a wide
gap between minority and majority scores on the college entrance
tests.
   Bennett said that since 1976 black students' scores on the SAT
have risen by 42 points to 728, while white students' scores fell
eight points to 936.
   He singled out South Carolina as a state that has made progress
in setting high academic expectations, holding educators
accountable and encouraging parental choice.
   Although South Carolina ranks last in SAT scores among the 22
states where that is the dominant test, its scores have risen 17
points in two years to an average of 832.

<DATELINE>BISCHOFSWERDA, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet troops today began the
early removal of nuclear missiles from East Germany and
Czechosolovakia under terms of a new superpower arms agreement yet
to be ratified.
   Western reporters this morning saw a train loaded with 32
containers leave Bischofwerda, about 20 miles east of Dresden.
   Officials at the scene said the containers were packed with
parts of dismantled SS-12 rockets and that the train's destination
was the Soviet Union, where the missiles are to be destroyed.
   In addition to the missile parts, 150 of 400 Soviet soldiers
stationed at Bischofswerda also left on the train. Officials at the
site said the remaining soldiers will leave by the end of the month.
   A large banner displayed at Bischofswerda's railroad station
read: ``Removal of Shorter-Range Rockets, a Contribution to
Security and Peace.''
   A local kindergarten class sang: ``We greet you soldiers, you
protect the happiness of children.''
   The top Communist Party functionary of Bischofswerda, Hannelore
Strugalla, said ``the first practical step in nuclear disarmament
is being accomplished in our hometown.''
   The SS-12s are included in the superpower treaty on removal of
medium- and shorter-range nuclear missiles from central Europe. The
accord was signed by President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev in December.
   Dmitri T. Yazov, the Soviet defense minister, said Monday while
Secretary of State George P. Shultz was in Moscow that withdrawal
of the SS-12s would begin this month as a ``display of goodwill.''
   The treaty is before Congress and the nominal Soviet parliament
for approval.
   There were five rocket launchers, eight missiles and four
practice missiles stationed at Bischofswerda, according to
officials.
   Removal of the warheads from the missiles was completed one week
ago, officials said, and additional rocket parts are to be removed
from the site within the next two days.
   Soviet troops were also removing SS-12s today from Waren, East
Germany, where there are 22 missiles, nine launchers and seven
training rockets, according to figures released after the
superpower treaty was signed.
   Waren is about 90 miles northwest of Berlin.
   The East German government arranged to transport 100 Western
journalists to the two sites to witness the removal of the rockets.
   The SS-12s _ which have a range of about 560 miles _ fall under
the ``shorter-range'' classification in the superpower arms treaty,
which covers rockets with a range from 300 to 3,100 miles.
   In Czechoslovakia the loading was taking place in the Moravian
town of Hranice, the country's official news agency CTK said.
   According to the report, the missiles were transported during
the night from a nearby military zone to the railway station where
the loading operation began.
   CTK added that the first of the missiles would leave Hranice for
the Soviet Union this evening.
   CTK quoted Soviet Lt. Col. Vyacheslav Granovsky as saying Soviet
officers, mechanics and drivers who had serviced the missiles being
dismantled would leave with the first transport today.
   Granovsky did not say how many rockets and Soviet personnel will
leave Czechoslovakia. He also did not say when withdrawal of all
the missiles would be completed, and gave their destination only as
''a predetermined place in the Soviet Union.''
   CTK said the removal of the Soviet missiles was being watched by
60 reporters, but it was not known if any Western journalists were
invited.
   Hranice, with a population of 12,500, has been singled out by
Czechoslovak officials as the only place in the country where
Soviet missiles had been stationed.
   ``The step of the Soviet government, the removal of
operational-tactical shorter-range missiles before ratification of
the Soviet-American agreement, is further proof of the sincerity,
concreteness and constructive approach of the Soviet peace policy
to nuclear disarmament and the creation of a more secure world,''
CTK said.
   The withdrawal occurs during the 40th anniversary of Communist
rule in Czechoslovakia.

<TEXT>
   A polygamist charged in the bombing of a
Mormon chapel and a standoff with police has asked that his trial
be moved out of state because of publicity and the dominance of the
Mormon Church in Utah.
   The polygamist, Addam Swapp, and co-defendants Vickie Singer and
John Timothy Singer also want separate trials, court documents
indicated Wednesday.
   Mrs. Singer and Swapp also are asking again to be released from
jail. A magistrate ruled earlier that they were unlikely to
voluntarily return for trial.
   A similar request was filed late Wednesday on behalf of Jonathan
Swapp, Addam's brother, but it had not yet been added to the court
file.
   Earlier this month, Mrs. Singer, 44; John Timothy Singer, 21;
Addam Swapp, 26, and Jonathan Swapp, 21, pleaded innocent to
charges stemming from the Jan. 16 bombing of the Mormon chapel in
Marion and the subsequent 13-day standoff at their nearby farm.
   The siege ended Jan. 28 with the shooting death of a corrections
officer and wounding of Addam Swapp. State murder charges have not
been filed yet.
   Mrs. Singer is the widow of John Singer, a polygamist killed by
police nine years ago during an arrest attempt, and the mother of
John Timothy Singer. Two of her daughters are wives of Addam Swapp.
   Addam Swapp's lawyers are asking U.S. District Chief Judge Bruce
S. Jenkins to transfer the trial on the ground that Swapp ``cannot
obtain a fair and impartial trial in the District of Utah.''
   Defense attorney Bill Morrison said news coverage and religious
prejudice make a fair trial impossible.
   ``The atmosphere is charged and volatile and rife with
misinformation,'' he said. ``The LDS (Mormon) Church represents a
sizable portion of the population.''
   Government attorneys were not available to comment on whether
they would contest any of the defense requests.

<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino and
thousands of Filipinos joined hands today in a ``chain for peace''
to mark the second anniversary of a popular revolution that ended
decades of authoritarian rule.
   The country's leading churchman, meanwhile, warned that the
Philippines cannot survive with huge gaps between rich and poor.
Leftists staged protest marches and accused the president of
abandoning promises of reform.
   Several hundred followers of former President Ferdinand Marcos
rallied at a downtown Manila square, calling for the ousted ruler
to be allowed to return. Police said the Marcos loyalists dispersed
peacefully after nearly three hours.
   About 50,000 people jammed a 1{-mile stretch of Epifanio De Los
Santos Avenue, or EDSA. On that same avenue in February 1986,
hundreds of thousands of people formed a human wall for four days
to protect mutineers holed up in two military camps from Marcos'
forces.
   The civilian-backed military mutiny, popularly called the
``People Power'' revolution, forced Marcos into exile in Hawaii on
Feb. 25, 1986, after he had ruled for more than 20 years.
   A Philippine Air Force T-28 airplane swooped low over the crowd,
which also participated in a procession of images of the Virgin
Mary, including one borne by an armored personnel carrier.
   Officials said the images were the ones carried by priests and
nuns during the 1986 revolt in this heavily Roman Catholic land.
   The day began with the pealing of church bells and Mrs. Aquino
clasping hands with Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos and Chief of
Staff Gen. Renato de Villa on EDSA, in front of the Camp Aguinaldo
general headquarters.
   The ceremony was followed by a daylong carnival, featuring
singing, folk dancing and performances by well-known entertainers.
   But during an afternoon mass, Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, archbishop
of Manila, warned that the government must address the urgent
social and economic crisis facing this nation. Half of the 58
million Filipinos live in poverty.
   ``The ever-growing gap between rich and poor in our society must
be drastically reduced,'' Sin said. ``Only then can our nation
survive and go forward.''
   Sin said the need for land reform ``hangs over us like a sword
of Damocles'' and added ``urgent reforms must be taken without
delay.'' Mrs. Aquino ordered a land reform program last July but
left details to Congress, which has yet to approve the legislation.
   Parades and festivities were held in other major cities across
this nation of more than 7,100 islands.
   But from a shopping center near EDSA, about 10,000 leftists
marched to the presidential palace, waving red banners, chanting
slogans and accusing Mrs. Aquino of betraying the reformist ideals
of the uprising two years ago.
   On Wednesday, about 20,000 leftists chanting slogans in support
of communist rebels, marched to the scene of today's celebrations
and burned an effigy of Mrs. Aquino.
   In 1986, Sin called on Filipinos to turn out into the streets to
back mutineers led by then-Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and
Ramos.
   Enrile and Ramos had broken with Marcos, charging him with fraud
in the Feb. 7, 1986, presidential election in which he ran against
Mrs. Aquino. The rebels' action galvanized the opposition that
began after the 1983 assassination of opposition leader Benigno
Aquino, Mrs. Aquino's husband.
   Prospects for broad social, economic and political reform since
Mrs. Aquino rose to power have been clouded by a $28 billion debt,
a cumbersome legislature and political polarization widened by the
19-year-old communist insurgency and the military's rising clout.
   As chief of staff, Ramos has fended off six coup plots. But
social activists fear Mrs. Aquino's reliance on Ramos has lessened
the government's commitment to reform.
   The government so far has not prosecuted soldiers for alleged
involvement in several widely publicized killings of civilians. Nor
has it fulfilled Mrs. Aquino's 1986 campaign promise to abolish the
Civilian Home Defense Force, a military-backed militia widely
accused of human rights abuses.

<HEAD>Gunmen Hurl Grenade At Militiamen Searching for Higgins</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen today hurled a hand grenade at
Shiite Moslem militiamen searching for a kidnapped U.S. Marine in
south Lebanon. Police said eight people were wounded.
   A police spokesman said two gunmen threw the grenade from a
speeding car at an Amal militia checkpoint near the inland village
of Dweir. Militiamen at the checkpoint were searching cars looking
for Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.
   The attack coincided with a threat by Amal to use force to free
Higgins. Amal also summoned Shiite clerics to a meeting to discuss
his abduction.
   ``Six Amal militiamen were wounded along with two civilians,''
said the police spokesman. He cannot be named in line with standing
regulations.
   Higgins, 43, was abducted Feb. 17 near Tyre, 50 miles south of
Beirut. He headed an observer group assigned to a United Nations
peacekeeping force in south Lebanon.
   The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth claimed
it abducted Higgins and alleged he was a CIA spy. U.S. and U.N.
officials denied the accusation.
   Higgins is one of nine Americans and 25 foreigners missing in
Lebanon.
   The Shiite militiamen, the police spokesman said, opened fire at
the speeding car, but the two gunmen escaped. He did not elaborate.
   Amal, in a statement, identified the attackers only as
``suspicious elements.'' It confirmed that six of its militiamen
were wounded in the blast.
   Dweir, a stronghold of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, is 15 miles
northeast of the port of Tyre.
   ``The resort to force to free Higgins is not unlikely once we
locate the place where he is being held,'' said Daoud Daoud, Amal's
military commander in south Lebanon.
   Daoud, who has been supervising the search for Higgins, said he
had ``confirmed information that 25 people specializing in
kidnapping have been sent to south Lebanon to abduct more
foreigners.'' He did not elaborate.
   Daoud's remarks were broadcast by the Beirut-based Voice of the
Nation radio. It was not the first statement by Amal that it would
use strong measures to free Higgins, but it was the most clear-cut
reference so far to using force.
   A spokesman for the Syrian-backed Amal said improved weather
conditions ``allowed us to speed up the search'' for Higgins
southeast of Tyre.
   ``We believe Higgins is still in the area south of the Litani
River,'' he said. He refused to elaborate on the remark. The Litani
River is four miles north of Tyre.
   The spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said every
car leaving the area south of the river was being searched.
   Amal, he said, also summoned Shiite clerics in south Lebanon to
a meeting in Tyre to discuss Higgins' abduction and its effect on
the Shiite community.
   Amal has arrested six men it says were involved in the
kidnapping. The detainees, however, have not been able to provide
information on the whereabouts of Higgins and the mastermind of the
abduction, who reportedly has fled the area.
   The detainees, according to the spokesman, include the three
gunmen who seized Higgins and the three who monitored his movements
before the abduction.
   Amal also has arrested the man who was supposed to take Higgins
to Beirut, the spokesman said.
   The seven detainees are among 42 members of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah captured by Amal in the Tyre region in connection with
the abduction of Higgins.
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth is a pro-Iranian
underground faction believed linked with Hezbollah. Hezbollah is
believed to be an umbrella for underground factions involved in the
kidnapping of the 25 foreigners in Lebanon.
   The longest held foreign hostage is Terry A. Anderson, 40, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was seized
in Moslem west Beirut March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
   A former Argentine general accused of
kidnapping and killing civilians in his country was told his
refusal to answer lawyers' questions would harm him in a U.S. civil
suit by a former prisoner.
   U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti told Carlos Suarez Mason on
Wednesday that if he continued his silence, any fact he was asked
about would be considered true for the purposes of the $20 million
lawsuit.
   Suarez Mason, who is fighting extradition to Argentina, defied
an order by a federal magistrate earlier this week and refused to
answer questions about his alleged responsibility for atrocities in
military prisons during the late 1970s.
   The proposed questions include whether Suarez Mason had
authority to order torture and executions at prisons run by the
First Army Corps, which he commanded from 1976 to 1979.
   The former general said Monday he would not answer questions
without having a lawyer. The issue of whether the lawyer Suarez
Mason has hired for the extradition case must also represent him in
three civil suits without additional pay is now before the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Conti told the lawyers to submit written questions and ordered
Suarez Mason to be ready to answer on March 28, a day before the
scheduled trial of the civil suit and a week after his scheduled
extradition hearing before another judge.
   Suarez Mason, 63, is charged in Argentina with 43 murders and 24
kidnappings of civilians, allegedly committed by soldiers under his
command during the so-called ``dirty war'' against suspected
leftists.
   He fled Argentina after a civilian government came to power in
1983 and was arrested in January 1987 at his home in Foster City,
south of San Francisco. He is being held without bail.
   Three civil suits have been filed against him by former
Argentinians now living in the United States, who say they were
tortured or their relatives were killed by soldiers under the
general's command. U.S. courts have allowed damage suits for acts
committed abroad in violation of international law by a foreigner
who is physicially in the court's district.

   A witness said at the
kidnapping trial of Abbas Hamadi that a Lebanese mediator may have
been involved in the 1987 abduction of two West Germans whom he was
reputedly working to free.
   Ronnie Andrea Klein told the court Wednesday that she once lived
with the mediator, businessman Rashid Mahroum, and had last talked
with him in November 1987.
   ``I had a feeling that he (Mahroum) might be involved with the
kidnappings,'' she said.
   Mahroum, who now lives in Lebanon, has denied any involvement in
the January 1987 kidnapping of West Germans Rudolf Cordes and
Alfred Schmidt in Beirut.
   Hamadi is on trial in Duesseldorf on charges of masterminding
the abductions in a bid to win the release of his brother, Mohammed
Hamadi, who is charged in connection with the 1985 hijacking of a
TWA airliner.
   The West German government last year arranged for Mahroum to act
as a middleman with the captors of Cordes and Schmidt.
   Federal police have said they are now seeking Mahroum for
questioning in the kidnappings.
   Ms. Klein told the court she lived with Mahroum in the West
German city of Fuerth from April 1984 to December 1985, and that
the two were still on friendly terms up to late last year.
   ``I last spoke to him on the telephone in November,'' Ms. Klein
said, adding she believed he was then in Beirut.
   Mahroum traveled to Beirut as a mediator in February 1987,
returning with a photocopy of Cordes' passport and demands by his
captors that West Germany reject a U.S. extradition request for
Mohammed Hamadi.
   ``Are you aware if he (Mahroum) has any special political or
religious convictions?'' chief Judge Klaus Arend asked Ms. Klein.
   ``None that I know of,'' she testified.
   West German security officials say they believe Cordes is being
held by Hezbollah, or Party of God, a radical Shiite Moslem group
with close ties to Iran.
   Mohammed Hamadi is being held in a Frankfurt prison, awaiting
trial on charges of air piracy and murder in connection with the
June 1985 hijacking. No date has been set for the trial.
   Thirty-nine Americans were held hostage for 17 days and a U.S.
Navy diver was killed during the TWA hijacking.
   West Germany last year turned down the U.S. extradition request,
saying it would try Mohammed Hamadi instead.
   In earlier trial testimony, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of
staff, Wolfgang Schaeuble, said the government was forced into
making that decision, fearing for the lives of Cordes and Schmidt.
   Schmidt and Cordes were kidnapped in Beirut shortly after the
Jan. 13, 1987 arrest in Frankfurt of Mohammed Hamadi. Cordes
remains a hostage in Lebanon, but Schmidt was released in September.
   Another West German, Ralph Rudolph Shray, was kidnapped on Jan.
27 and remains a hostage. There have been no claims for that
abduction.
   Abbas Hamadi's trial resumes March 1, with further testimony
expected about Mahroum.

   The Census Bureau called today for local
govrnment help updating the accuracy of maps to be used in the 1990
national head count.
   Each of the approximately 39,000 municipal and county
governments across the nation will be sent a computer-drawn map
next month, showing the most current boundaries on file at the
bureau.
   Census officials are asking that local government leaders review
these maps and make any changes necessary.
   Even if local boundaries have not changed, local leaders were
urged to carefully inspect the maps, which are the first prepared
by the bureau's new computerized mapping system, said Robert W.
Marx of the Census geography office. He said the agency wants to
promptly catch any errors that may have occurred in preparing the
maps.
   The bureau estimates that one municipality in five has had some
boundary change since the 1980 census through annexations,
detachments, incorporation or disincorporation.

   A strike by public school teachers set for
today was put on hold this morning as union negotiators considered
the district's latest contract offer and school officials canceled
classes because of snow.
   Talks recessed at 6:30 a.m. today when negotiators for the
Cleveland Teachers Union agreed to take the school board's latest
proposal to the union's executive board later in the day.
   Superintendent Alfred Tutela called off classes for the
district's 72,639 students, citing the weather, although no other
area school districts were closed. Cleveland received up to 3
inches of snow overnight.
   The district is Ohio's largest public school system.
   Union negotiators had set a bargaining deadline of 3 p.m.
Wednesday and a strike deadline of midnight, but talks continued
into early this morning at a downtown hotel under the supervision
of federal mediator Jack Buettner.
   Union President Eugene Kolach said teachers would not set up
picket lines outside schools because classes had been canceled. He
declined further comment.
   The union's executive board agreed to meet at 3 p.m. today to
consider the board's proposal, Buettner said. He declined to say
whether he believed the proposal could lead to a tentative contract.
   ``Both sides were probably shooting for higher goals than they
were able to obtain,'' Buettner said. ``There are several stumbling
blocks, and I can't really get into a lot of detail.''
   The union, which has 5,093 members, has been without a contract
since Sept. 1.
   The school system had planned to close schools if a strike
materialized, but continue classes for the district's 3,600 high
school seniors.
   Bargainers would not comment on details of the negotiations, but
both sides have differed on the issues of teacher salaries and a
career ladder system.
   The latest bargaining session began at 10 a.m. Tuesday and
continued almost non-stop until 6:30 a.m. today, except for a
three-hour break Wednesday night. Buettner shuttled offers back and
forth between the bargaining committees, which were in separate
rooms at downtown hotel.
   Tutela last month urged teachers to accept a mandatory career
ladder system that would hinge pay raises to performance
evaluations.
   Union negotiators have said they want participation in the
career ladder to be an option.
   The union had been seeking a 5.8 percent wage increase this
year, while the district was offering a 2 percent one-time bonus
payment. Union negotiators said the amount of the increases could
vary depending on the length of the proposed contract.
   Annual salaries for teachers range from $17,687 for beginners to
$37,457 for teachers with a master's degree and 35 years
experience. The average teacher pay is $29,000.
   The union represents classroom teachers, guidance counselors,
teacher aides, librarians and reading specialists.
   About 40 parents and others staged a demonstration Wednesday
outside the hotel where talks were being held to encourage
continued negotiations. The rally was organized by the Interchurch
Council of Greater Cleveland.

   A U.S. Supreme Court ruling overturning a
$200,000 award won by the Rev. Jerry Falwell against Hustler
magazine has dashed a legal argument that could have stifled
political satire, constitutional lawyers say.
   The unanimous decision Wednesday held that even pornographic
parodies about public figures are protected by the First Amendment
as long as the satire could not be reasonably interpreted as
factual.
   The decision was greeted with relief by First Amendment
specialists.
   ``I've been telling my class, if that one makes it, we're in
trouble, the First Amendment is in serious difficulty,'' said
Professor C. Thomas Dienes of the George Washington University
National Law Center.
   Falwell had successfully argued in lower courts that he had
suffered emotional distress as a result of an ad parody in
Hustler's November 1983 and March 1984 issues. The
``advertisement'' had a photograph of Falwell and purportedly
quoted him discussing a sexual encounter with his mother and
describing himself as a habitual drunkard. At the bottom in small
print, readers were told that the ad was ``not to be taken
seriously.''
   The jury in the original Falwell suit found that there was no
libel, but awarded Falwell $200,000 after finding the magazine
parody had intentionally caused him emotional distress.
   Falwell stood by his arguments Wednesday.
   ``I fully appreciate the deep concerns the court has shown for
the sacredness of the First Amendement,'' Falwell said in a
statement. ``However, I respectfully disagree with their ruling.
Just as no person may scream ``Fire!'' in a crowded theater when
there is no fire, and find cover under the First Amendment,
likewise, no sleaze-merchant like (Hustler publisher) Larry Flynt
should be able to use the First Amendment as an excuse for
maliciously and dishonestly attacking public figures as he has so
often done.
   ``I believe the Supreme Court has given the green light to Larry
Flynt and his ilk to print what they wish about any public figure
at any time with no fear of reprisal.''
   But First Amendment lawyers said Falwell's claim of distress as
the basis for a libel judgment invited such chaos in the libel
field that even such Supreme Court justices as William Rehnquist
and Antonin Scalia, not considered steadfast supporters of press
rights, could not accept it.
   The high court also rejected Falwell's claim that the parody was
libelous because of its ``outrageousness.''
   ``The concept of outrageousness is so ambiguous that it is just
not viable as a basis for First Amendment standards,'' said Dienes.
``If they allowed that, it would have opened an incredible amount
of litigation against the media. Just imagine the number of
parodies that cause humiliation, embarrassment.''
   Don Gillmor, director of the University of Minnesota's Silha
Center for the Study of Media Ethics and Law, said the language in
Falwell's argument actually dates back to an 1897 case in England,
Wilkinson vs. Downston, which held that a statement could be
libelous if it was ``extreme and outrageous exceeding all
reasonable bounds of decency, leading to emotional distress that is
severe and is intentionally reckless.''
   Gillmor said the high court apparently rejected that theory
because it ``opened up indefinition, confusion and even judicial
chaos, and (the Supreme Court) just didn't want to deal with it.
Even if they didn't like the press protections, this doctrine was
just too complex an alternative.''
   ``I think rough-and-tumble should be the rule,'' said A.E. Dick
Howard, a University of Virginia law professor. ``I think the
opinion is right on.''

<TEXT>
   Iran said today that Saudi Arabia has
forbidden a representative of Iranian revolutionary patriarch
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini from visiting the country to prepare
for the Moslem pilgrimage.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Prime Minister
Hussein Musavi as saying this was evidence of the insolence of the
Saudi government. The agency did not provide a direct quote.
   It said the Saudis refused to let Emam Jamarani, Khomeini's
representative and head of the pilgrimage and religious endowments
organization, travel to Saudi Arabia in preparation of the July
gathering.
   Last summer, riots in the holy city of Mecca during the
pilgrimage left 402 people dead, more than half of them Iranians.
Tehran said police sprayed pilgrims with machine-gun fire. Riyadh
said the violence was planned by Iran and many of the victims died
in stampedes.
   There was no immediate Saudi response to Musavi's comments.
   Saudi Arabian Interior Minister Prince Nayef has affirmed that
the kingdom will not tolerate a recurrence of last year's
``sacrilegious acts.''
   ``Any acts against the safety and security of the pilgrims and
the holy sites will be sternly dealt with,'' he said.
   Iran has said it plans to send 150,000 pilgrims this year and
will organize ``antipathy towards pagans'' rallies again, similar
to the event last year that ended in death.
   Moslems are required to undertake the pilgrimage at least once
in their life if they can afford it.

<HEAD>Bork Says His Defeat Stifled Lawyers Who Want To Be Judges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Bork said today the defeat of his
Supreme Court nomination has discouraged lawyers from publishing
controversial legal articles and advised future nominees to
consider waging a national campaign to get on the court.
   ``I think this has been very bad for the intellectual life of
the law,'' said Bork, who resigned as a federal appeals court judge
three weeks ago.
   His experience has led several lawyers to withdraw articles from
legal publications, Bork said in an interview on ABC's ``Good
Morning America.'' He described the new lawyers' credo as:
``Express only noble sentiments and arrive at only noncontroversial
results.''
   Bork said judges who have written less than he has could simply
refuse to answer questions about their judicial philosophy at
confirmation hearings, but he felt it necessary to discuss issues
about which he had written.
   ``It certainly will inhibit the development of their thought,
and it will certainly inhibit the development of the law's evolving
intellectual structure,'' he said.
   Bork said that as a judge he did not think it proper for him to
wage a media campaign for his appointment, but said of future
nominees: ``I would advise them to think about it because I think
the alternative is defeat if this kind of campaign is waged against
them.''
   Bork said he wished the White House had done more to counter the
media and mail campaign against his nomination, which was rejected
by the Senate.
   ``The White House was caught flat-foooted by an unexpectedly
virilent campaign and just didn't get around to responding in time.
I understand that,'' said Bork, who is joining the Institute for
Public Policy Research, an educational and research organization
that says it takes no positions on public policy issues.

   While police investigated the explosion, a soldier charged in
the shooting death of a Roman Catholic civilian was freed on bail
and then turned over to military custody.
   The IRA, which is fighting to end British rule in Northern
Ireland, claimed responsibility for the Wednesday night bombing in
a telephoned statement to Belfast news organizations.
   Police said Pvt. James Cummings and Pvt. Frederick Starrett,
both 22, were killed by the remote-controlled explosive as they
locked the steel anti-terrorist gates on Royal Avenue in downtown
Belfast. Two soldiers and a 57-year-old civilian bystander were
slightly injured.
   Belfast police said the bomb probably contained about 150 pounds
of explosives. The blast shattered the windows of shops and offices
several hundred yards away.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King called the attack ``a
carefully planned and very vicious one indeed.''
   The anti-terrorist gates are guarded by Ulster Defense Regiment
soldiers, who search the bags and other items of shoppers and
others passing in and out during the day.
   Police said the bomb went off at 11 p.m. when few civilians were
about and that there was no warning from the bombers.
   The two deaths brought Northern Ireland's death toll since
sectarian and political violence flared in 1969 to at least 2,628.
   On Wednesday, police charged an 18-year-old British soldier,
Pvt. David Jonathan Holden, with unlawfully killing an unarmed
Catholic civilian last Sunday. A Northern Ireland court today
turned Holden over to military custody on $1,925 bail.
   The defense said Holden will plead innocent to the charge of
unlawfully killing Aidan McAnespie, 23, from an army observation
post at a checkpoint near Auchnacloy, half a mile from the Irish
Republic's border. Holden's court appearance is set for March 9.
   McAnespie was an election worker for Sinn Fein, the legal
political arm of the IRA. The British army said McAnespie was
killed by a ricocheting bullet after a machine gun was fired
accidentally.
   But Cardinal Tomas O Fiaich, Roman Catholic primate of all
Ireland, has said he believes McAnespie was murdered. Catholic
leaders in the province said McAnespie had been regularly harassed
by the army.

<HEAD>Dallas Officer Shoots Man to Death During Robbery Attempt</HEAD>

   An off-duty police officer shot a man to death
early today during an armed robbery attempt in a restaurant after
the man reached for a weapon and challenged the officer to shoot
him, police say.
   The shooting was the fifth involving Dallas police in less than
two months. Six people have died, including two officers.
   ``Shoot me,'' Dallas Police Lt. Ron Waldrop quoted the man as
telling the off-duty officer as he reached for the weapon in his
waistband. The officer was not in uniform.
   The man was shot twice and was pronounced dead at the scene,
Waldrop said.
   Police withheld the names of the officer and the victim.
   ``We are still doing the interviews,'' Detective Rick Silva
said. ``More details will be available later.''
   The off-duty officer entered a Denny's Restaurant in southwest
Dallas to purchase food when he saw that a man had confronted a
waitress near a cash register, Waldrop said.
   The officer said he heard the man demand money and saw what
appeared to be a pistol in the man's waistband, Waldrop said.
Investigators later discovered that the weapon was actually a knife
with a handle similar to a pistol's, Waldrop said.
   The officer displayed his badge and gun and identified himself,
Waldrop said. It was then that the man went for the weapon and
challenged the officer to shoot him.
   Dallas police have come under fire by minority leaders and City
Hall in the past two years for being trigger-happy when confronting
suspects, especially blacks and Hispanics.
   However, tension flared last month after Police Chief Billy
Prince accused council members of fostering anti-police sentiment
that led to the death of Officer John Chase in a highly publicized
shooting Jan. 23.
   Witnesses told police that Chase was shot by a transient who had
wrestled his gun from him and was egged on by some spectators. The
transient was later shot to death after firing at police.
   Since then, many rallies have been staged in support of the
department.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan's assertion that Secretary of
State George P. Shultz and former Defense Secretary Caspar W.
Weinberger did not object to the idea of an arms-for-hostages deal
with Iran goes against earlier statements by himself and the two
Cabinet officers.
   The president, responding to a question about whether Vice
President George Bush objected to the failed policy, said at his
news conference Wednesday night that he did not ``want to be
surrounded by yes men. And yes, there were reservations.''
   The president, as in the past, declined to elaborate on Bush's
role. He then pointed to Shultz and Weinberger as others who voiced
objections _ but he said they were not opposed to the basic policy.
   ``They did not object to the idea that we were trading arms for
hostages,'' the president said.
   He said that Shultz and Weinberger ``knew what we were trying to
do'' and implied their main concern was public image.
   ``Their objection was that, if and when this became known, as it
would be, it would appear that we were trading hostages for, or
arms for hostages,'' he said.
   A year ago, after the two Cabinet secretaries complained about
the Tower Commission report statement that they didn't fight the
policy hard enough, Reagan backed their position.
   ``Both Secretary Shultz and Secretary Weinberger advised me
strongly not to pursue the initiative,'' he said. ``I weighed their
advice and decided in the end that the initiative was worth the
risk and went forward.''
   Shultz, asked about the comments today during a flight to
Israel, said he had testified ``endlessly'' and that it was based
largely on his own records.
   ``I am not going to go over it anymore,'' he said. ``I've
testified and I really don't have anything to add or subtract
because my testimony is based to a very healthy extent on records
and notes and so on.''
   Shultz and Weinberger, testifying last summer before
congressional investigators, said they were kept in the dark by the
White House aides arranging the deals.
   Shultz said he was ``sick to my stomach'' when he first learned
some of the details of the policy. He said he fought a ``battle
royal'' to make sure Reagan was aware of what was going on.
   Both Shultz and Weinberger said they objected to the plans in
1985 and at a Dec. 7 meeting that year ``I made a very strong
objection to the whole idea, as did the secretary of state,''
Weinberger said.
   Weinberger said he objected because the United States was asking
other countries not to sell arms to Iran, that there was no one
reliable to deal with there, and that if it were an
arms-for-hostages deal the government was laying itself open to
blackmail.

   An armored truck hauling $400,000 in
coins overturned on a freeway, spilling a torrent of change that
broke through the truck's roof and scattered across the lanes,
authorities said today.
   Three people were treated for minor injuries.
   ``The weight of the coins actually blew the top of the vehicle
right out,'' said California Highway Patrol Officer Lyle Whitten,
describing the accident late Wednesday on the eastbound Pomona
Freeway.
   A guard riding in the back of the truck was ejected by the
force, but he escaped serious injury.
   ``He wasn't buried (in coins), and that's what saved him,''
Whitten said.
   The guard and two other people in the truck were treated and
released at Queen of the Valley Hospital for minor injuries, said
nursing supervisor Terri Coleman. Their names were not released.
   ``I understand they're all OK,'' said Bill Beamon of Brink's
Inc. in San Bernardino.
   The three-ton armored truck was hauling $400,000 in coins from
Los Angeles to San Bernardino-area banks when both right rear dual
tires blew out, Whitten said.
   The truck careened out of control and rolled onto its side as
boxes of coins knocked the roof off and scattered onto the freeway
lanes.
   Brink's and highway patrol officials said they couldn't estimate
the weight of the coins, but Nelson Italiano at the Union Plaza
Casino in Las Vegas said an average weight of the various coins
could equal 38 tons.
   ``It's approximately a half-million dollars in the No. 4 (lane),
the on ramp and the right shoulder,'' said Officer Richard Perez of
the highway patrol.
   Most of the money was boxed, Whitten said, but about $300 in
loose half dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies rolled
across some 35 feet of roadway.
   Sgt. John Williams, an off-duty highway patrol motorcycle
officer, on his way home from work, saw the accident and stopped to
secure the area, Whitten said.
   ``People had already started to stop, even before he got off his
motorcycle ... and he shooed them away.''
   Another Brink's truck carrying paper money stopped to help the
victims, Whitten said.
   The highway patrol shut down several freeway lanes as Brink's
employees gathered the boxed and loose change and loaded it into
another armored vehicle, dispatcher Sabrina Elswick said. Most of
the money was recovered, officials said.
   ``Police are everywhere guarding it; you couldn't get near it,''
said Los Angeles County fire Capt. Art Montgomery.
   Industry is about 15 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.

   Pentecostal leaders gathered today to
deliberate the fate of TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart after an
admitted prostitute said she performed pornographic acts for him
for about a year.
   The woman's account, in a New Orleans television interview
Wednesday, added to pressures besetting the Executive Presbytery of
the Assemblies of God, at its international headquarters here.
   The nation's largest Pentecostal denomination, which gets $12
million a year from Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries in Baton Rouge,
La., reported being swamped with up to 300 calls an hour since the
evangelist confessed last Sunday to unspecified sexual misconduct.
   About half of the callers complained that the denomination's
Louisiana council's recommendation that Swaggart be suspended from
preaching for three months and receive counseling was too lenient,
said Juleen Turnage, Assemblies' secretary of information.
   ``A lot of people are unhappy with the initial recommendation,''
said the Rev. Richard Champion, editor of the denomination's
weekly, Pentecostal Evangel. ``Many thought it too light. Some
thought it too severe.''
   Mrs. Turnage said public sentiment would not be a factor for 12
presbyters who planned to convene this afternoon in a closed
session to discuss Swaggart's punishment.
   The church's final verdict will be in accord with ``the
seriousness of the offense,'' Mrs. Turnage said.
   An unwritten church precedent is that those involved in sexual
offenses are barred from preaching for at least a year. ``It's
never been less than a year,'' she said.
   Church sources raised the possibility that the presbytery could
instruct the Louisiana district council to reconsider its
recommendations on grounds that members of Swaggart's board
improperly participated and the results were announced prematurely.
   ``It created tremendous pressures, appearing that the Louisiana
district was trying to dictate its judgment,'' said the Rev. Howard
Cummings of Aurora, Colo., a former district presbyter.
   Swaggart, whose ministry brought in $142 million in 1986, is the
denomination's most prominent evangelist with fire-and-brimstone
broadcasts in more than 100 countries. He has been known for his
harsh denunciations of sexual lapses by other preachers, including
PTL founder Jim Bakker.
   Evangelist Marvin Gorman has a $90 million lawsuit pending
against Swaggart, claiming Swaggart falsely accused him of numerous
acts of adultery. Gorman reportedly gave the denomination
photographs of Swaggart entering and leaving a motel room with a
prostitute.
   A woman who gave her name as Debra Murphree told WVUE-TV of New
Orleans that she had met with Swaggart for about a year at various
motels to perform pornographic acts.
   ``To me, I think he's kind of perverted or, you know, talking
about some of the things that we talked about in the rooms, you
know, I wouldn't want him around my children,'' Murphree told a
reporter who traced her to a motel in West Palm Beach, Fla., on
Wednesday.
   The station did not say how the reporter tracked the woman down,
but said it did not pay for the interview.
   The station quoted her as saying she was the woman with Swaggart
when he was photographed last October, and that she did not have
sexual intercourse with Swaggart.
   ``He wanted me to get naked and maybe lay on the bed and pose
for him,'' she said.
   ``He asked me if he could take me home and get dressed up in a
dress or something, you know, no underwear and ride around you know
and just, maybe in the evening, and take my clothes off and maybe
get out of the car and just get back in and, you know, it sort of
turned him on.''
   The Jefferson Parish sheriff, in New Orleans' western suburbs,
said Wednesday that Murphree had been arrested for soliciting for
prostitution. Police in Tampa, Fla., similarly reported that
Murphree had been arrested in 1985 and 1986 for loitering for
prostitution and soliciting for exposure.
   Tampa police said Murphree also was known to them as Deborah
Arlene Hedge, 28, a native of Princeton, Ind.
   Murphree said her trysts with Swaggart occurred in motels on
Airline Highway between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. She said
Swaggart would pick her up once or twice a month in his
telephone-equipped Lincoln Town Car.
   She said Swaggart never discussed God or religion with her.
   The Washington Post reported today that witnesses said Swaggart
wore hats, sunglasses and headbands, or combed his hair down in
front to help disguise himself.
   Murphree said she was sure her companion was Swaggart even
though he did not use his name:
   ``Oh, I knew who he was.''

<HEAD>New Drug Effective Alternative For Endometriosis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new drug for treating endometriosis may provide
an alternative for women unable to tolerate the side effects of the
only medicine now available for this common condition, doctors say.
   A report published today concludes that the drug, called
nafarelin, works as well as danazol, the standard medical treatment.
   About 5 percent of all women during their reproductive years
have endometriosis. The disorder occurs when tissue from the lining
of the uterus grows in other places in the female reproductive
system. Symptoms can include back and abdominal pain during or
after menstrual periods. Severe cases may require drug treatment or
surgery.
   Although danazol is highly effective, some women cannot take it
because of its side effects. Nafarelin also causes some unwanted
symptoms, but experts say these may be less offensive to some
patients.
   A report on a comparison of the two drugs in 213 women was
published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The test was
directed by Dr. Milan R. Henzi of Syntex Research, a pharmaceutical
firm in Palo Alto, Calif.
   ``In my opinion, this is the best-designed and best-executed
trial of drug therapy for endometriosis ever reported,'' Dr. Robert
L. Barbieri of Harvard Medical School wrote in an accompanying
editorial.
   Danazol is derived from the male sex hormone testosterone. Some
women who take it complain of weight gain, swelling, acne, hair
growth and deepening of the voice, among other side effects.
Danazol also causes unfavorable changes in blood cholesterol levels.
   Nafarelin, which is given as a nasal spray, does not affect
cholesterol levels, but it has other side effects, mainly hot
flashes, descreased sex drive and vaginal dryness.
   In the study, both drugs reduced the extent of the disease in
more than 80 percent of patients.
   Barbieri said that for women who cannot tolerate danazol,
nafarelin ``represents an important therapeutic alternative.''
   The new drug is one of a class of synthetic hormones that
temporarily shut off the body's production of sex hormones.
Nafarelin is also being tested as a treatment for prostate
enlargement in men. Currently, the drug is approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration only for treatment of prostate cancer.

   Two South African church
leaders, including Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, today called
for nationwide services to protest the government crackdown on 18
opposition groups.
   ``I hope our people will still be willing to try non-violent
strategies. ... But we have nothing to show for our non-violent
approaches. If violence erupts, what will be surprising is that it
has taken so long,'' said Tutu, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize
for his fight against apartheid.
   Tutu met with the Rev. Frank Chikane, general-secretary of the
South African Council of Churches, to discuss a response to the
orders banning political activities by the opposition organizations.
   ``I would not be surprised if they (the government) act against
the church,'' Chikane told reporters.
   The meeting took place at Khotso House, the Johannesburg
headquarters for many of the restricted organizations. Black paper
was draped at Khotso House as a sign of mourning.
   Both clergymen appealed to the black majority not to lose hope,
to white voters to disassociate themselves from the government, and
to the international community to isolate South Africa.
   Newspapers, business leaders and politicans criticized the
government, saying the suppression of the major black political
groups would provoke violence.
   In Lusaka, Zambia, the outlawed African National Congress called
for ``resistance and defiance.'' The ANC is the main guerrilla
organization fighting to end white-minority domination in South
Africa.
   ``The organizations and civic bodies that have thus been banned
were committed to non-violent forms of struggle,'' the ANC said in
a statement.
   ``It is not advocacy of or engagement in armed struggle that the
regime fears, but the very expression of democratic opposition.''
   President P.W. Botha on Wednesday gave Law and Order Minister
Adriaan Vlok the power to prohibit all activity by any
organization. Vlok immediately banned 17 organizations, including
the largest anti-apartheid coalition, the United Democratic Front,
from engaging in political activities.
   He also prohibited the nation's largest labor federation, the
750,000-member Congress of South African Trade Unions, from
engaging in any political activity, including commemorating days of
importance to blacks.
   In addition, restrictions were imposed on the activities of
individual black leaders.
   ``I regret the further erosion of the rule of law. ... Banning
and detentions can never be the solution,'' said the Rev. Allan
Hendrickse, leader of the mixed-race house of Parliament. Whites
and people of mixed race are represented in Parliament, but not the
26 million black majority.
   Colin Eglin, leader of the anti-apartheid Progressive Federal
Party, said, ``The government was busy turning South Africa into a
third-grade banana republic where real power is not with the
Parliament, the courts or the people but in the hands of a
restricted political clique.''
   Gavin Relly, chairman of Anglo-American Corp., the nation's
biggest conglomerate, said, ``The curtailment of civil and
political freedoms to the interests of public order should be
subject to judicial control. Yesterday's actions are steps away
from the rule of law.''
   The New Nation, a newspaper for blacks published by the South
African Catholic Bishops Conference, was among several observers
predicting increased violence because of the regulations, which
Vlok said were meant to improve the atmosphere of peace and
security.
   ``Trade unionists have warned that by banning the commemoration
of days of mourning, the government has set the stage for massive
confrontation,'' The New Nation said. ``The ban is unlikely to stop
workers from observing these days.''
   The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, said the government
actions were inevitable but added: ``Suppression of radical or
revolutionary movements does not solve the country's problems. It
only provides the space within which solutions can be found.''
   The orders ``violate a number of basic freedoms, more
particularly the freedoms of association and expression,'' said
Robert Charlton, vice chancellor of the University of the
Witwatersrand. He said the clampdown would provoke protest and
disruption on campuses.
   The large black political organization Inkatha was not among
those restricted. But the leadership in the KwaZulu Legislative
Assembly, headed by Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, condemned
the restriction of black organizations, including those with which
Inkatha has been feuding.
   ``There would be no need for the state of emergency if black
democracy was unshackled and if blacks were free to support the
leaders and the parties of their choice,'' the KwaZulu caucus said.

   A military judge today convicted an Army
private who fled his West German post for the Soviet Union on a
charge of being absent without leave, rejecting the more serious
charge of desertion.
   Pfc. Wade E. Roberts received a bad conduct discharge and was
stripped of his military benefits, but avoided imprisonment. He
could have faced one year of hard labor on the AWOL conviction.
   The sentence, imposed by Col. Earl Pauley, brought moans and
gasps from those in the courtroom.
   The military's lawyer, Capt. Daniel Shaver, who prosecuted the
case, said afterward he was shocked by the sentence and had
expected Roberts to serve prison time.
   Roberts and his wife hugged and kissed after the verdict was
announced.
   Roberts fled his base at Giessen, West Germany, on Feb. 28 and
traveled with his girlfriend, Petra Neumann, to the Soviet Union.
He returned to West Germany on Nov. 4, and was arrested the
following day.
   The military had pressed for the desertion charge in the two-day
court-martial at Fort Dix.
   Roberts' attorney, Ronald Kuby, said Pauley's decision showed
``We're not going to have a political trial, we're not going to
have a show trial. We're not going to punish people because they
make friends in the Soviet Union.''
   Roberts testified earlier today that he returned to the West
from his eight-month self-imposed exile to the Soviet Union because
he and his pregnant girlfriend became disenchanted with communism
and feared being trapped there.
   ``I wanted to get out of the country,'' Roberts said. ``We
didn't like it.''
   The Riverside, Calif., serviceman calmly told the court that he
and his girlfriend, whom he later wed, didn't like their work at a
Soviet snake laboratory. He also said that he feared that if his
son was born there, he would automatically be granted Soviet
citizenship.
   ``We felt if he were a Soviet citizen, we'd be trapped there,
and we wouldn't be able to leave,'' Roberts said.
   On Wednesday Roberts testified he was told to stop seeing Ms.
Neumann.
   ``I was told by my first sergeant I shouldn't see my wife
anymore _ at the time, she wasn't my wife _ she was pregnant,''
Roberts said. ``I was put on restriction, and I was experiencing
some problems with my sergeants.
   ``I left, and I went to Petra's apartment,'' he added. ``I
stayed away for over 30 days, and eventually I ended up in the
Soviet Union.''
   Kuby, said Roberts' actions didn't meet the legal definition of
desertion: unauthorized absence with no intent to return to the
military.
   ``Wade Roberts panicked,'' Kuby said. ``He didn't want to be
separated from his wife.''
   Shaver called more than a half-dozen witnesses to the stand to
establish that Roberts didn't like his unit, had disciplinary
problems and wanted to leave.
   One witness, Alfred Santos, a security officer at the U.S.
Embassy in Bonn, said he spoke by telephone to Roberts the day of
his arrest. Santos said Roberts pleaded to be allowed to turn
himself in to embassy officials.
   ``He said ... words to the effect he didn't trust the military
... and that he didn't want to go back,'' said Santos.
   Kuby argued that Roberts maintained his U.S. citizenship while
in the Soviet Union and kept his military identification card.
   Roberts' attorneys argued he was the target of ``selective and
vindictive prosecution,'' and that he was being tried because he
fled to a communist country. They asked that the charge be
dismissed.
   Kuby said that of the 1,048 AWOL or desertion cases processed
last year at Fort Dix, fewer than 10 resulted in prosecutions.
   But Shaver contended the Army has prosecuted cases like
Roberts'. He said Roberts' choice of the Soviet Union is a
legitimate factor in determining whether to proceed with desertion
charges.
   Pauley agreed, and said the defense did not prove their client
had been singled out.
   The case is being heard by a judge because Roberts exercised his
option not to be tried by a jury of five officers and enlisted
personnel.
   Ms. Neumann attended the court martial, but refused to answer
most questions from reporters. The couple have a 2-month-old son.

<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein pardoned a British
businessman sentenced to life in prison for bribing Iraqi officials
after a plea from British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
officials said today.
   A British Embassy official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the Iraqi president pardoned John Smith on Wednesday as David
Mellor, a British Foreign Office minister, held talks with Iraqi
officials.
   In London, the Foreign Office said Mellor delivered a letter to
the Iraqi president from Mrs. Thatcher asking for his help in
obtaining Smith's release.
   It said 46-year-old Smith of Hazelmere in Lancashire had not
been released yet. ``We don't expect it to be too long. There are
bureaucratic procedures to complete,'' said a spokesman.
   The Foreign Office said Smith's release ``is the happy
culmination of a number of efforts over a number of years.'' It
added that ``no deals have been struck.''
   The Iraqi officials accused of being involved with Smith were
tried and executed.
   Smith, managing director of the specialist vehicle manufacturer
Hestair Dennis, was arrested in 1979 while talking with an Iraqi
official in a park.
   He was convicted in 1980 of bribing officials and sentenced to
life imprisonment, which in Iraq means 20 years.
   At the time he was also accused of ``economic espionage'' but it
was not clear whether he was ever formally charged or convicted on
such a charge.
   The Iraqis convicted in the case were executed according to an
Iraqi law that prohibits receiving bribes from foreign salesman or
providing them with information related to the state.
   Another British businessman, Ian Rechter, is imprisoned in Iraq
after being tried in 1987 and convicted of bribing the mayor of
Baghdad, who was found guilty of taking bribes from Rechter and
later executed.
   Mellor also pressed for Rechter's release but no decision has
yet been taken by Iraqi authorities.

   A bomb exploded near a crowded
grandstand tonight as thousands of Filipinos marked the second
anniversary of the overthrow of President Ferdinand Marcos, police
said.
   Elisa Florido, a nurse at the Medical City Hospital, said 14
people were injured, mostly by flying glass and debris. None was
seriously hurt, she said, and there were no reports of fatalities.
   The blast occurred at about 10 p.m. near the main grandstand set
up on Epifanio De Los Santos Avenue, or EDSA, a broad boulevard
between two military camps.
   It was at EDSA two years ago that hundreds of thousands of
Filipinos came to protect mutinous troops from soldiers loyal to
Marcos. The four-day standoff culminated in his flight to exile in
Hawaii on Feb. 25, 1986.
   The blast occurred about five hours after President Corazon
Aquino, Manila Archbishop Cardinal Jaime L. Sin and other
dignitaries attended a mass at the grandstand and prayed for peace
in this troubled island nation.
   None of the dignitaries were believed to be at the scene during
the blast.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing.
   The military had been on full alert in case Communist rebels or
right-wing dissidents tried to disrupt the celebrations.
   One witness, Monica Soliman, told radio station DZXL that she
and her family were returning to their car when they saw two men
behind the stage tying what appeared to be three sticks.
   ``When we reached the car, we turned on the radio and suddenly
we heard an explosion,'' she said.
   One unidentified man, interviewed by radio station DZXL, said
the blast occurred during a fireworks display.
   ``We were watching the fireworks when suddenly something
exploded behind us,'' he said. ``My brother was injured in the
back.'' The man said he was about 70 feet from the explosion.
   The blast took place near the end of a daylong celebration that
began shortly after dawn with a flag-raising ceremony and a Mass,
and continued with singing and dancing into the night.
   Earlier, Mrs. Aquino, Defense Minister Fidel Ramos and Gen.
Renato de Villa, the military chief of staff, and other senior
officials had joined hands with thousands of people for a ``chain
of peace'' along EDSA.

   Vice President George Bush, answering
presidential rivals in South Carolina, today rejected ``pure,
all-out protectionism'' and said existing trade laws are sufficient
to help the state's textile industry against foreign imports.
   Bush raised the subject of textiles a day after Republican
candidate Bob Dole campaigned in the state and called for passage
of legislation restricting foreign textile imports.
   Republican Pat Robertson has also backed the textile bill and
has declared South Carolina _ a state where textiles are an
important industry _ a major battleground for his campaign.
   ``Don't go for this pure, all-out protectionism that may save
one job and then throw three neighbors in this burgeoning state out
of work,'' Bush said. ``That isn't the answer.''
   He spoke to several hundred students, teachers and others at an
assembly at Tri-County Technical College. He also spoke briefly
with students in an industrial electronics class, accompanied by
South Carolina Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr., his state campaign
chairman.
   The textile import legislation has support in South Carolina and
other textile and apparel-producing states of the South. President
Reagan vetoed similar legislation after it passed Congress two
years ago.
   ``What I propose is that we enforce the law,'' Bush said.
   Campaigning Wednesday in Vermont, Bush demanded an apology from
Robertson for indicating Bush's campaign was somehow responsible
for the timing of allegations of sexual misconduct against Jimmy
Swaggart, a television evangelist.
   Robertson, however, suggested in Louisville, Ky., today that if
Bush had heard exactly what he said there would be no apology
demand.
   ``I was, frankly, misquoted in the press,'' he said.
   Robertson _ a former television evangelist himself _ said
earlier this week he thought it odd that the Swaggart controversy
erupted just to weeks before Super Tuesday, when 20 states will
choose delegates to the national party conventions, suggesting that
the controversy was timed to embarrass him.
   Robertson said he had no proof of political involvement in the
Swaggart revelations. But in the same interview, Robertson accused
Bush's campaign of ``dirty politics'' and ``trickery.''
   ``By sundown in the old South, I'd like to see him stand up like
a Southern gentleman with a little evidence,'' Bush said Wednesday
in Burlington, Vt. ``I'd like to see an apology or proof.''
   Bush was campaigning today in South Carolina, which holds its
primary on March 5, three days before the Super Tuesday contests in
20 states, mostly in the South.
   Bush also expressed puzzlement over another Robertson contention
_ that his Christian Broadcasting Network at one point had
information about the whereabouts of the American hostages in
Lebanon and that ``they could have been saved.''
   Robertson spokesmen later said Robertson had been referring to
passengers and crew members of a TWA flight, who were held briefly
in Lebanon following a 1985 hijacking.
   ``My question would be, how come he didn't get a hold of the
proper authorities in the United States government that were
working day and night, trying to figure out how they could get
those people out?'' Bush said at a stop in Boston.
   Bush, in appearances Wednesday in New England, sought to set
himself apart from his rivals _ Rep. Jack Kemp, Dole, and Robertson.
   ``You're selecting a president, not a congressman, not a
senator, not a preacher,'' he said.
   On another matter, the vice president said he expected to win in
Vermont's non-binding presidential primary next Tuesday.
   Bush said he did not think his campaign was damaged by a pair of
losses in Minnesota's GOP caucuses and South Dakota's primary, both
Tuesday. Dole won in both states.
   Bush's campaign had pulled resources out of South Dakota and
Minnesota in order to concentrate on the contests of March 8, Super
Tuesday.
   The vice president said he didn't believe the results had any
effect on a subject he ``learned the hard way about in 1980 _
momentum.''
   During that election, Ronald Reagan overcame Bush's early
primary victories to win the Republican nomination.
   Reagan, at a nationally broadcast news conference on Wednesday
night, took the opportunity to defend Bush, who has come under
questioning on the campaign trail about his role in secret arms
sales to Iran. Bush has refused to detail his advice to the
president on the matter, citing confidentiality, but has said he
expressed private reservations.
   Reagan corroborated that, adding: ``I don't want to be
surrounded by yes men.''
   ``There were reservations, but I'm not going to go into (them)
just as he wouldn't go into the private discussions that we may
have had,'' the president said.

   Secretary of State George Shultz said today
the origins of Palestinian rioting in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank are ``essentially indigenous,'' a statement the White House
said was consistent with President Reagan's assessment that the
riots do not appear to be ``home grown.''
   Shultz, speaking during a flight to Jerusalem, where he hopes to
amerliorate the conflict in the occupied territories, said, ``It's
fundamental origins are essentially indigenous.''
   He also told reporters that ``there is an underlying problem
consisting of a large number of people in occupation who haven't
had the basic rights of governance.''
   Hours earlier, Reagan said at a nationally televised news
conference that ``there is every evidence that these riots are not
just spontaneous and home grown.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked about the two
men's statements, said, ``Those are totally consistent.''
   ``The president said the same thing,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
``He just said they (the riots) were partly influenced by outside
sources.''
   ``He is saying that it is indigenous in the nature of the
political problem there but there has been some outside influence
as well,'' the spokesman said. ``He is saying exactly what we have
said all along.''
   Fifty-nine people have died since the rioting began, most of
them shot by Israeli troops.
   Reagan said, ``We have had intimations that there have been
certain people suspected of being terrorists, outsiders coming in,
not only with weapons, but stirring up and encouraging the trouble
in those areas.''
   Asked about saying the riots were not ``home grown,'' Reagan
added:
   ``That isn't something you can go out and say we absolutely
know, but certainly the violence is both ways.''
   Shultz said intelligence showed ``a mixed picture'' with
``interaction with outside force.''
   But he said ``there is an underlying problem consisting of a
large number of people in occupation who haven't had the basic
rights of governance. So we seek among other things consistent with
Israel's security, to look at things that will help Palestinians
gain legitimate rights.''
   Reagan offered no evidence to support his assertion that
outsiders and terrorists are to blame for the violence, saying
security rules prevented him from doing so.
   He declined to criticize Israel's policy of beating large
numbers of Palestinians and occasionally firing on the protestors.
   But he said, ``We don't support that sort of thing and we are
trying to persuade all the participants to try to arrive at a
solution representing justice for all.''
   Reagan added that ``we have spoken to the government there and
we have also spoken to the Palestinian leadership because there is
every evidence that these riots are not just spontaneous and
home-grown.''
   Previously, administration officials had not given any
indication that any outside involvement was suspected in the
rioting.
   The president said ``it's time for us to arrive at a true peace
and recognize the rights of all'' in the Middle East.
   He said peace in the Middle East ``would be one of the greatest
achievements of this administration.''
   Reagan did not go into detail about U.S. proposals, but Israeli
officials have already said they oppose two elements. One part is
an international conference in April to seek an interim solution in
the occupied territories, while the second is a December date for
talks to begin on a final settlement.
   The president said ``it's time for all parties to rid themselves
of old ideas and stances that cannot work and to begin a serious
process of negotiation and reconciliation.''
   ``Any process that is undertaken must meet Israel's security
needs and satisfy the legitimate rights of the Palestinians,'' he
said.

   India successfully test-fired its first
surface-to-surface missile Thursday, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
announced in Parliament.
   The missile has a range of 155 miles, used a computer-aided
navigation system and could be fitted with different warheads, the
United News of India reported.
   The new missile _ named ``Prithvi,'' the Hindu word for Earth _
was designed by scientists at the government-owned Defense Research
and Development Organization, the news agency said.
   Gandhi did not say where the test took place.
   He said India was the fifth country in the world to successfully
develop this class of missile, the others being the United States,
the Soviet Union, France and China.
   In April, India tested its first domestically produced
surface-to-air missile. India exploded a nuclear device in 1974,
but says its atomic program is for peaceful purposes.

   The government destroyed more than 41,000
acres of illicit poppies last year, it was reported Thursday.
   The state-owned Working People's Daily said the government also
seized 3,250 pounds of raw opium, 178 pounds of heroin and 66
pounds of morphine base during 1987.
   The poppies were destroyed both by hand and by aerial spraying
of herbicides, it said.
   In 1986, the government destroyed more than 40,000 acres of
poppies and seized 3,900 pounds of raw opium, 105 pounds of heroin
and 63 pounds of morphine base, the newspaper said.
   The opium is grown mostly by hill tribes in eastern Burma and
refined into heroin by armed trafficking groups operating along the
Thai-Burmese border.

   It was one of those days for the Daily Telegraph.
   The masthead of the Wednesday's editions of the newspaper
mistakenly said it was Thursday, and it reportedly caused havoc
throughout the land.
   The Telegraph reported on Thursday's front page that one reader
complained he had traveled to Birmingham a day too soon after being
misled by Wednesday's paper.
   Someone else went to the dentist a day early, and some elderly
readers went to post offices to collect pensions that normally
arrive on Thursday.
   Several hundred people called to point out the mistake, the
paper said.
   ``The majority were puzzled and confused,'' it quoted
switchboard operator Rita Sherman as saying. ``But some were very
annoyed and upset, particularly those who had traveled all over the
place thinking it was Thursday and got there before they found out.
But a nice cross-section saw a funny side to it.''
   The Telegraph said the misprint in 300,000 copies of Wednesday's
final edition.
   ``To all of you _ those who saw the funny side and those who did
not _ we offer our humble apologies,'' the paper said.

   Nine of those countries _ Angola, Benin, Botswana, Chad,
Ethiopia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique and Niger _ will require
exceptional emergency relief, the statement said.
   Althoe than 1 million of the 1.3
million tons of food aid needed by drought-stricken Ethiopia,
relief operations there face logistical problems, the report said.
   Edouard Saouma, FAO director general, appealed to donors to send
Ethiopia trucks, spare parts, fuel and port-handling equipment.

   The Federal Election Commission said today it
is all right for a presidential campaign to write off half the cost
of a TV ad as a fund-raising expense even if the overt money
solicitation is only a tiny part of the commercial.
   In its 4-2 decision, the commission signaled to the presidential
campaigns that it will allow a practice that some critics have said
is a method of evading the state spending limits imposed on the
campaigns.
   Dissenting from the ruling, Commissioner Joan Aikens said the
agency was merely ``sanctioning creative accounting to get around
the limits.''
   ``I think we are absolutely blowing the state limits out of the
water,'' she said.
   But other commission members said the FEC should not be getting
involved with scrutinizing every campaign ad to determine what
portion contained a fund-raising appeal.
   Commissioner Thomas Josefiak said that even if an ad appears to
be mostly issue-related, as long as it has an overt fund-raising
message as well as information on how to contribute _ such as a
telephone number to call _ the ad can be considered to have a dual
purpose. In that case, a 50 percent allocation for fund-raising
would be appropriate, the commission determined.
   Fund-raising allocations are important to presidential campaigns
because they are not counted against the federally mandated limits
on spending in each state.
   The opinion comes in answer to a query from Sen. Albert Gore
Jr., the Democratic contender from Tennessee, whose staff
complained about the approach used in Ioa by rivals Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.
   The issue involves how much of the costs of TV ads can be
excluded from the total that a campaign spends against an
expenditure ceiling in each state. Fund-raising costs are not
counted against the cap, which in Iowa this year was $775,000.
   Gore did not mention the other campaigns in his request for an
FEC opinion, but posed his question as a hypothetical involving a
60-second ad for his own campaign, with a fund-raising appeal in
the last three seconds.
   Gore asked if he could count only 50 percent of that ad's cost
against the cap. The legal counsel's opinion was that 5 percent
would be a more reasonable figure.
   Gore's hypothetical paralleled Gephardt's commercial in Iowa in
which the final seconds contained the request for viewers to
``Vote, volunteer, contribute.'' Gephardt excluded half the cost
from the spending his campaign allocated to Iowa.
   Such a practice is valuable in Iowa because all of the campaigns
wanted to spend large sums to get high visibility in the nation's
first Democratic caucus.
   Dukakis also ran ads that contained only a brief fund-raising
appeal at the end, with the rest of the ad focused on issues, and
he counted 40 percent as fund-raising.
   In response to Gore's question, the FEC legal staff said that
writing off part of the ads as a fund-raising expense is
legitimate. But the opinion said the write-off should be generally
proportional to the portion of the ad that contains a fund-raising
message.
   The FEC opinion by counsel Larry Noble said that a 50 percent
writeoff for that would not be reasonable.
   ``Given that the only appeal to contribute occurs in the final
three seconds of the 60-second spot, an allocation of 5 percent (or
less) to the exclusion would be reasonable,'' the opinon said.
   The Gephardt and Dukakis campaigns had cited the precedent of
Sen. John Glenn's presidential campaign in 1984, in which the FEC
allowed a 50 percent fund-raising writeoff for Glenn's half-hour TV
show.
   Noble's opinion noted that the FEC decides such matters on a
case-by-case basis.
   Campaigns use the FEC case-specific rulings, however, as
guidelines for their own activities.

   President Reagan broke his silence about the
candidates vying for his job, slapping out at Republican Pat
Robertson, defending Vice President George Bush and ridiculing the
Democrats, saying, ``The kids will play.''
   The president, in fielding questions Wednesday night at his
first news conference in four months, also gave strong backing to
his embattled attorney general, Edwin Meese, saying, ``I have every
confidence in his integrity.''
   However, Reagan refused to comment on the investigation of
Meese's role in a proposed Middle East oil pipeline. Reagan said he
had no recollection of knowing about the pipeline deal until
recently.
   A relaxed Reagan opened with a smile, saying ``on the networks
at last'' _ a gibe at ABC, CBS and NBC for refusing to broadcast
his Feb. 2 speech appealing for Contra aid.
   However, he appeared uncomfortable at times, saying he was not
aware of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's complaint in
Senate testimony earlier Wednesday that the administration was
putting too much election-year pressure on the Fed to lower
interest rates.
   In his testimony, Greenspan was highly critical of a letter sent
by Assistant Treasury Secretary Michael Darby to top Fed
policy-makers 10 days before they were to meet to set monetary
growth targets for 1988.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, asked today if the
administration agreed with Greenspan, said, ``Yes, we do. We have
the highest regard for Chairman Greenspan and the work he's doing,
(we're) very concerned about any pressure being applied to the Fed
because they are an independent body, doing an outstanding job.''
   At his news conference, Reagan also contradicted his own
previous statements and those of Secretary of State George Shultz
and former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger by claiming the two
had not objected to the secret sale of arms to Iran on grounds it
was an arms-for-hostages deal.
   Shultz and Weinberger have said otherwise, and the Iran-Contra
report issued by two congressional committees said the secretaries
``called it a straight arms-for-hostages deal that was contrary to
U.S. public policy.''
   Brushing aside questions on the seemingly differing statements,
Fitzwater said today, ``I don't feel they need any reconciliation.
These are all matters of interpretation.''
   Reagan has tried from the start of the political campaign to
steer clear of the presidential race, but he suddenly switched
course with an open slap at Robertson.
   The former television evangelist had said earlier in the day
that his own Christian Broadcasting Network once knew the
whereabouts of American hostages in Lebanon ``and they could have
been freed'' if the United States had acted promptly.
   In reply, Reagan said that if Robertson knew where the hostages
were being held, ``he kept it to himself.'' The president said it
would be ``very strange'' if it happened the way Robertson
described it.
   As for the plight of the nine Americans now held in Lebanon,
Reagan declared, ``we've never let up, and we never will'' in
trying to obtain their freedom.
   Robertson, campaigning in Louisville, Ky., said today that
reporters for his network did have hostage information in 1985,
that he offered the information to the major television networks
and that he was then contacted by low-level State Department
officials.
   Reacting to Reagan's skepticism, he said, ``I wasn't meaning to
start some major confrontation with a person I admire tremendously,
but obviously the State Department must have dismissed what we had
to say, or else they didn't refer it up the line to the president.''
   In defense of Bush, Reagan corroborated the vice president's
claim that he had expressed private reservations about selling arms
to Iran.
   The president said he put down orders that ``I don't want to be
surrounded by `yes' men. And, yes, there were reservations, but I'm
not going to go into (them) just as he wouldn't go into the private
discussions that we may have had.''
   Asked about Democrats' charges that his administration has been
plagued by corruption, Reagan sidestepped the question and instead
accused Democrats of misrepresenting his administration's record on
the economy.
   ``If anyone listened for more than 15 minutes to their
candidates, he would decide that we're in an economic slump, we're
burdened by inflation, high interest rates and unemployment when,
at the moment, none of those things are true. ...
   ``So, I just think that, you know, the kids will play, and as
long as they want to do that, but I hope it'll easily be
forgotten.''
   Reagan's meeting with reporters coincided with Shultz's
departure for the Middle East to try to get Arab-Israeli peace
talks moving.
   ``It's time for all parties to rid themselves of old ideas and
stances that cannot work and to begin a serious process of
negotiation and reconciliation,'' Reagan said.
   ``Any process that is undertaken must meet Israel's security
needs and satisfy the legitimate rights of the Palestinians.''
   He said there is ``every evidence'' that outside terrorists have
been stirring up trouble in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip. He refused to say who he was talking about. Fitzwater today
insisted there was no difference between what Reagan said and
Shultz's claim that the problem was largely indigenous.
   Pointedly, Reagan passed up several opportunities to criticize
Israel's crackdown on Arab protestors in which more than 50
Palestinians have been killed. Reagan's strongest statement on the
subject was ``we don't support that sort of thing.''
   On other topics, Reagan:
   _Said Shultz had given him an ``encouraging'' report on his
just-completed trip to the Soviet Union. During the talks in
Moscow, Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze set
a one-month deadline for arms negotiators to complete drafts on key
elements of a new treaty to curb strategic nuclear weapons.
   _Said that a Democratic proposl limiting aid to the Contras to
``humanitarian'' assistance was ``fine, and then we'll take our
chances'' on another attempt at getting military aid for the rebels.
   _Said he had not decided whether to tell Congress that aid
should be resumed to Panama. To do that, he has to certify that
Panama is helping in anti-drug efforts, but Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, Panama's military leader, has been indicted on U.S.
drug-trafficking charges.

   Two journalists were charged with
defaming the army and the defense minister after reporting he tried
to sell arms to famine-stricken Ethiopia instead of offering aid,
state television said.
   France Zavrl, chief editor of the Slovenian Mladina youth
weekly, and Andrej Novak, a journalist of the Teleks weekly, were
charged with ``offending and disdaining'' the army and Adm. Branko
Mamula, the defense minister, in published articles, state
television said.
   Mamula has faced tough criticism in a series of articles
published in the liberal republic of Slovenia for his February
visit to Ethiopia.
   The articles said that Mamula traveled to Ethiopia in order to
sell arms instead of offering food and financial aid.
   The charges against the journalists followed a recent sharp
statement issued by Yugoslavia's collective presidency, which
called for action against frequent press attacks on the army and
its leadership.

   A Swedish court has ordered a
prostitute infected with the AIDS virus to be isolated to keep her
from spreading the disease, it was reported Thursday.
   The unidentified woman, also a heroin addict, said she will
appeal the ruling. She argued that she has abandoned prostitution
and does not pose a health threat.
   She is under 24-hour guard in a hospital ward for AIDS patients,
and will remain there until the government opens a planned
institution for carriers of the disease on an island near
Stockholm, the newspapers said.
   Reports about the institution last year raised protests of
infringement on civil liberties.
   Swedish law allows authorities to restrict the movement of
people with contagious diseases who ignore medical advice on how to
avoid infecting others.
   The government is reviewing the law, which originally was aimed
at venereal diseases and other maladies that could be cured in a
short time, said Agneta Lagerroth of the Social Ministry.

   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz
today blamed longtime Israeli occupation, not outside agitation,
for the violent unrest in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Shultz said, ``Its fundamental origins are essentially
indigenous.''
   President Reagan, at a news conference Wednesday night, blamed
``terrorists'' and ``outsiders'' he did not identify for the
violence in the Israeli-held territories, which Israel seized in
the 1967 Middle East war. He cited intelligence reports but gave no
details.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today that the
statements of Reagan and Shultz were ``totally consistent.''
   ``The president said the same thing,'' Fitzwater said. ``He just
said they (the riots) were partly influenced by outside sources.
... He is saying that it is indigenous in the nature of the
political problems there but there has been some outside influence
as well.''
   Shultz flew to Jerusalem today with U.S. proposals for an
overall Mideast settlement.
   He said intelligence showed ``a mixed picture'' with
``interaction with outside force.'' But he added, ``There is an
underlying problem consisting of a large number of people in
occupation who haven't had the basic rights of governance.
   ``So we seek among other things consistent with Israel's
security, to look at things that will help Palestinians gain
legitimate rights.''
   Shultz defended his decision to stop in Syria while in the
Middle East.
   In the past, he accused Syria of terrorism and said the United
States should try to isolate the country. Sanctions were imposed in
1986, including a ban on meetings between high-level U.S. and
Syrian officials.
   ``In the first place, the Syrian involvement in terrorism seems
to have diminished, and we have had some definite moves that have
been made that we found encouraging,'' he said.
   ``I don't mean to say that the problem is resolved,'' Shultz
added, but he said the United States had realized how important a
role Syria plays in the region.
   ``So we will go there and hear what they have to say and tell
them what we have to say, recognizing their significance,'' he said.
   Shultz also seemed to disagree with Reagan over the Iran-Contra
affair.
   The president said Shultz and former Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger had objected to the secret sale of U..S arms to Iran,
not because it amounted to a trade for American hostages held in
Lebanon but because it could be perceived that way.
   Shultz, asked about the statement during a refueling stop here
on the way to Israel, did not directly challenge Reagan but said,
``I've testified and I really don't have anything to add or
subtract becasue my testimony is based to a very healthy extent on
records and notes and so on.''
   Shultz testified in private and in public that he had opposed
the U.S. arms sales to Iran because it had amounted to trading
weapons for hostages.
   He said the investigations had not brought out any other
argument by him and Weinberger against the sale.

<HEAD>Queen Tops List of Britain's Wealthiest 200</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Queen Elizabeth II, whose personal fortune is a
closely guarded secret, is Britain's richest person worth an
estimated $5.87 billion, according to a list of the nation's 200
richest people.
   The list was front-page news in London on Thursday, with racy
tabloid headlines ranging from ``Filthy Rich'' in the Sun to
``Millionaires Galore'' in the Daily Mail.
   Money Magazine, which complied the list, said the
second-wealthiest Briton as 92-year-old Sir John Moores, founder of
the Littlewoods soccer pools empire, a weekly game for small-time
gamblers based on soccer results. It estimated his fortune at $2.99
billion.
   It listed the third-wealthiest Briton as supermarket chain owner
Garfield Weston, 60, chairman of Associated British Foods, with an
estimated personal fortune at $2.64 billion.
   In fourth place is the 36-year-old Duke of Westminster. His
inherited holdings include large chunks of highly desireable real
estate in central London, huge tracts of farmland and sweeping
acres of remote northern moorland. The magazine said his personal
fortune was about $2.46 billion.
   Money Magazine says Britain has seven billionaires, 18 families
and individuals worth more than $440 million each, and 20,000
millionaires as measured in pounds.
   The magazine's estimate of the 61-year-old queen's wealth makes
her the world's eighth-richest individual. It said the world's
richest person is the Sultan of Brunei, with an estimated fortune
equivalent to $24.64 billion.
   The Guinness Book of Records lists the richest person in the
United States as Sam Moore Walton, founder of Wal-Mart discount
stores in Bentonville, Ark., whose personal wealth was estimated in
mid-1987 at $4.5 billion ``and rising.''
   Money Magazine said financier Sir James Goldsmith _ fifth in its
list of Britain's wealthiest 200 with an estimated $1.76 billion _
was the only British billionaire to have made all his money since
the end of World War II in 1945.
   The youngest person in the top 200 is 31-year-old Sophie Mirman,
with an estimated $52.8 million. She and her husband, Richard Ross,
created the popular Sock Shop chain.
   Among the 12 women in the top 200 list are ``Dynasty'' star Joan
Collins and her sister, Jackie Collins, the author of a string of
best-selling raunchy novels. It said they are worth an estimated
$26.4 million between them.
   Editor Sue Thomas said it took six months to compile the list,
``consulting public sources of information and talking extensively
to analysts in the City,'' London's financial district.
   ``The people we did not talk to were the 200 themselves because
we wanted to keep the list under wraps until the last possible
minute. Many of the super-rich are very secretive,'' she said.
   Asked how it estimated the queen's wealth in view of the secrecy
maintained by her London bankers, Coutts and Co., Mrs. Thomas said:
``We found out as much as we could about the different headings
under which her wealth falls _ her castles and other properties,
her land holdings, her vast share portfolio, her stamp collection,
her art collection, her jewelry collection and so forth and we
talked to a lot of people with information.
   ``We arrived at what we estimate to be a minimum net worth for
all the people on our list.''
   It said 53 of the 200 fortunes stemmed from property. Five
percent of those listed came from abroad and only 15 percent belong
to the British aristocracy. The self-made rich outnumbered those
who inherited their wealth by 2-1.

   A French company has ordered American
subsidiaries to sell nearly 1 million acres of timberland from
Maine to New York, officials said today.
   General Occidentale wants to sell 800,000 acres of Diamond
Occidental Forest Inc. land in Maine, as well Diamond International
Corp. holdings totaling 90,000 acres in New Hampshire and Vermont
and nearly 96,000 acres in New York.
   The asking price totals more than $200 million, said Robert
Whitney, executive vice president of LandVest Inc., a Boston-based
timberland broker marketing the land in New York, Vermont and New
Hampshire.
   It would be the largest such land sale in the region since at
least 1960, Whitney said.
   A spokesman for the Diamond companies, based in Old Town, Maine,
would not comment today on the proposed sale of the Maine woodland.
Daniel Christensen did confirm the proposed sale of the New York,
Vermont and New Hampshire land.
   Whitney said the land probably would continue to be used for
timbering, and said General Occidentale hopes to find single buyers
for each of the three packages. The company decided to let its
subsidiary market the Maine package itself, he said.
   ``These 90,000 acres in New Hampshire and Vermont and 96,000
acres in New York State were too small for them to get involved in
marketing directly,'' Whitney said. ``They're used to dealing in
$100 million transactions.''
   The asking prices are $18.5 million for the New York package,
$19 million for the New Hampshire-Vermont land, and at least $170
million for the Maine land, Whitney said in a telephone interview
from LandVest's office in Portland, Maine.
   He said he expected likely buyers would be pension funds or
investment syndicates interested in stable returns from timber
sales.

<HEAD>More Medicaid Among Steps That Could Improve Child Health,
Congress Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Child health in the United States could be
improved through a number of steps ranging from an expanded
Medicaid program to child seat-belt requirements, a congressional
report said Thursday.
   The Office of Technology Assessment, which advises Congress on
scientific matters, also recommended better access to medical care
for poor children and pregnant women; newborn screening for several
disorders; and well-child care for those up to age 6.
   OTA said other promising approaches are school-based health
clinics and visiting nurse programs for families in which there is
a high risk of child abuse or the birth of low-birthweight babies.
   Judith Wagner, a senior assosciate at OTA, told the House Energy
and Commerce subcommittee on health and environment that the United
States ranked 17th among industrialized nations in infant
mortality, a position that showed no improvement in the past five
years.
   Wagner also said more than 20 percent of 2-year-olds were not
immunized against measles in 1985. He said poor children bear a
disproportionate share of illness and death, and a substantial
number of children do not have health insurance.
   OTA said it would be both effective and cost-saving to improve
access to early prenatal care for poor women, encourage
immunizations and preventive care for young children, and encourage
the use of child safety restraints in automobiles.
   The office said expanded newborn screening and universal
Medicaid eligibility for poor children would effectively improve
child health, although they would not necessarily save money.
   OTA recommended further study of two other approaches it
characterized as promising: visiting nurses for high-risk families
and comprehensive school clinics that offer family planning
services to adolescents at risk of unwanted pregnancy.
   Wagner said studies of two school-based clinics show they have
achieved some success in reducing pregnancy and birth rates. She
said Congress should seek more information on ``this rapidly
growing approach to delivering health services to high-risk
teen-agers.''
   Congress has been moving in recent years to include more
pregnant women and children in the Medicaid system. Subcommittee
chairman Henry Waxman, D-Calif., said Thursday he would introduce
legislation next week that includes several of OTA's suggestions.

   Thousands of people demonstrated today in the
Armenian capital, Yerevan, while the Soviet army sent in troops and
tanks to quell protests over a disputed area in neighboring
Azerbaidzhan, witnesses said.
   Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh virtually shut down the disputed
area with a strike, travelers from the area said. Some residents
said Armenians had been killed.
   Mofses Gorgiskyan, a resident of Yerevan, said in a telephone
interview that more than 1 million people were demonstrating there
today, but the report could not be verified. He said they demanded
that Armenian authorities act on their demand that Nagorno-Karabakh
be made part of Armenia.
   Soldiers arrived in the morning and took up discreet positions
in downtown Yerevan, particularly around key government buildings,
Gorgiskyan said. They also deployed camouflaged trucks downtown and
stationed tanks in outlying areas, he said.
   Gorgiskyan said some Azeris, members of the main nationality of
Azerbaidzhan, threw stones at a bus in an outlying area of
Nagorno-Karabakh on Tuesday and killed an undetermined number of
Armenians. Azeris also set fire to a school, resulting in other
deaths, he said.
   Gorgiskyan described himself as a 26-year-old member of an
underground group called the Alliance for National Determination.
   In Nagorno-Karabakh, virtually the entire Armenian population,
about 120,000, has been demonstrating in the main city since Feb.
13, said a 17-year-old resident.
   There was no way to verify the reports independently because the
government barred foreign reporters from traveling to the area.
   The resident, a student, also said some Armenians had been
killed by Azeris, but she could offer no details.
   Three-quarters of the residents of Nagorno-Karabakh are
Armenians. The demonstrators are demanding that Armenia's nominal
Parliament support demands that Nagorno-Karabakh be removed from
Azerbaidzhan and turned over to Armenia.
   The resident, a student interviewed in Moscow after flying from
Armenia, spoke on condition she not be identified. She said she saw
a crowd gathered this morning in Lenin Square in Nagorno-Karabakh's
main city, Stepanakert.
   ``Practically the whole population is there. They've come from
all the villages,'' said the student.
   The student confirmed that authorities brought in extra forces
at one point during the 12 days of demonstrations, but she said she
believed they were militiamen, not army troops.
   Another Armenian interviewed at Moscow's Vnukovo Airport
estimated that 1,000 people were demonstrating this morning outside
the Opera House in Yerevan.
   The demonstrations in Nagorno-Karabakh were continuing around
the clock and schools and businesses were closed in a strike, said
the student. ``No one's sleeping. No one is going to work. The only
stores open are groceries,'' she said.
   An official at the Armenian representational offices in Moscow
in charge of internal matters, Rudolf Khatchyanov, told The
Associated Press that a major demonstration by Armenians continued
in Yerevan. But he said he had no details.
   Repeated calls to Yerevan were broken off after only a few
seconds or did not go through at all.
   Paruyr Ayrikyan, an Armenian activist in Yerevan, said Wednesday
that 200,000 people demonstrated in the capital's central square,
demanding that the republic's Parliament convene to resolve the
dispute.
   Armenian officials had proposed annexing the mountainous
territory, but the party's national Central Committee earlier this
month decided Nagorno-Karabakh should remain part of Azerbaidzhan.
   On Wednesday, the Kremlin named an Armenian, Genrikh Pogosyan,
Communist Party chief in the area.
   An Armenian activist in Moscow, Sergei Grigoryants, praised the
appointment, but said it would not likely quell the protests.
   ``This was the first test of the ability of the country's
leaders to work out a compromise to a difficult situation involving
nationalities,'' Grigoryants said.
   But he said Armenian demonstrators are angered over what they
see as unconstitutional interference by the party.
   ``The demonstrators already have deemed this matter outside the
party's control,'' Grigoryants said.
   Demonstrations by Armenians against control by Azeris began late
last week after the party's decision was announced, Ayrikyan said.
   The Soviet army sent in tanks and troops as a show of force, and
rumors spread to Yerevan that some Armenian demonstrators were
killed in the melee that ensued, said Ayrikyan.
   Tass announced Wednesday night that Pogosyan had been named
party leader in the disputed region. Tass said Pogosyan was
Armenian and born in Nagorno-Karabakh. His predecessor, Boris
Kevorkov, also is Armenian.
   A later Tass report said party leaders in Yerevan met and voiced
support for the Central Committee decision to keep Nagorno-Karabakh
in Azerbaidzhan. The party meeting also issued orders to local
officials to take all steps necessary to end the protests.
   Nagorno-Karabakh is 1,760 square miles, smaller than the state
of Delaware.

<HEAD>Officials Say Missile Withdrawal Begins in East Germany,
Czechoslovakia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Communist officials and the
state-run press said Thursday that Soviet troops began withdrawing
SS-12 nuclear missiles from this town, where hundreds of people
waved flags and showered troops with gifts.
   Women pressed flowers on 150 Soviet soldiers and children gave
them books, candy and other gifts in an orchestrated, two-hour
ceremony at the train station. The troops have been here four years.
   As the train loaded with 32 canvas-wrapped containers pulled
away, the soldiers waved at the crowd and pressed the bouquets to
the windows.
   East German officials at the scene and the state-run ADN news
agency said the containers held parts of dismantled SS-12 missiles
and that the train was headed to the Soviet Union, where the
missiles would be destroyed.
   Western diplomats were skeptical.
   ``Until the arms treaty is in place, there is no way of
confirming what we are seeing, and what we are being told is
actually what it all appears to be,'' said one Western diplomat,
who asked not to be identified.
   In neighboring Czechoslovakia, the state-run CTK news agency
said Soviet SS-12 missiles were withdrawn from the town of Hranice,
southeast of Prague. It said a train carrying Soviet troops and 19
missile launchers left Hranice en route to the Soviet Union.
   The commander of Czechoslovak missile units and artillery, Lt.
Gen. Jan Krizan, was quoted by CTK as saying that Hranice was the
only place in Czechoslovakia where SS-12s were deployed.
   The shorter-range missiles, which have a range of 300 to 600
miles, would be the first nuclear weapons to be removed from
Central Europe under terms of a superpower arms treaty signed in
Washington last December.
   Soviet officials proclaimed the early withdrawal an ``act of
trust'' that the U.S. Congress would approve the accord.
   Military bands played and more than 1,000 residents waved small
East German, Soviet and Communist Party flags in Bischofswerda, a
city of about 12,000 near the Czechoslovak and Polish borders.
   Some people carried banners reading, ``An Early Missile
Withdrawal _ Proof of our Will for Peace,'' and ``Long Live the
Soviet-German Friendship.''
   Fifty-four SS-12 missiles have been based in East Germany, at
four separate sites, since 1983. They were deployed after NATO
deployed Pershing 2 and cruise missiles in Western Europe.
   ``This is an act of building trust,'' said Lt. Igor
Vladimirovich Obraszov, Soviet commander of one of the missile
batteries.
   Scores of East German soldiers were also on hand.
   ``Thank God they're leaving,'' said one East German army
lieutenant, referring to the Soviet missiles. ``For the past four
years I have had to accept being a possible target of a Western
attack.''
   The soldiers posed for photographers, shook hands with local
residents and tried to answer questions in halting English or
German.
   ``It is always good to be going home,'' said 1st Lt. Taras
Durayesky, a career army officer from Odessa as he boarded the
train. ``This is a good country, but I have been here four years.''
   More than 150 reporters watched the ceremony.
   CTK said 60 reporters were watching the removal of missiles from
Hranice, but no Western journalists were invited.

        ...   with the University of Texas as the guest team.
   It's appropriate that Texas be the opponent because the
Longhorns suffered some deep miseries in the airish, dank building
where you could catch a cold even if you had just been cured of one.
   Perhaps the worst night was when Mike Wacker, center of an
unbeaten Longhorns' team, slipped on a wet spot and so tore up his
knee that it ended any chance of an NBA career.
   Like a curse from some Egyptian tomb, the voodooed Longhorns
sank to a miserable season, giving Abe Lemons' detractors their
chance to fire him.
   The next year when Texas visited, one Baylor coach wanted to
shake the 'Horns by putting a black X where Wacker fell. But more
tasteful and cooler heads prevailed.
   Spooky things always happened at H.O.T. Of course, there was the
first rain delay in college basketball history this year when the
roof leaked, holding up play.
   But that was small trick-or-treat stuff compared to one game I
remember years ago involving the visiting Texas A&M Aggies.
   I believe an Aggie was at the free throw line when a
late-running Baylor tuba player crashed his automobile into the
power pole outside.
   It plunged H.O.T into darker darkness.
   The place had always been so dim that rival coaches threatened
to issue their players coal miners' lamps.
   Of course, A&M Coach Shelby Metcalf was fit to be fried. The
lights never were restored to full power. The Aggies finally agreed
to play the game out under eerie, twilight zone conditions. They
lost.
   ``You had to listen for the swish to know you made one,''
Metcalf quipped.
   Powers failures were always numerous in H.O.T.
   More than one deadline was blown by electrical outages which
sent stories to editorial graveyards. One sports writer slam-dunked
his chair into the stands in one outage outrage.
   More recently, the Baylor mascot knocked a Dallas radio off the
air briefly by stumbling over an electrical cord.
   Just getting into the building could be fun. I recall arriving
at a game early for prime position on gravel within several blocks
of the coliseum on a rainy evening.
   Feeling smug, I advanced to within 25 yards of the building
before almost disappearing in a mud hole large enough to lose a
Shetland pony.
   Baylor always had a big advantage in this ``pit.''
   The Bears at least knew where the dim rims could be found. Crowd
seating on the floor also gave the Bears a huge psychological edge.
   But Baylor was hurt in the recruting wars because of the
decaying coliseum.
   Former Coach Jim Haller always liked to talk about school
academics and such on recruiting visits. He knew he was dead if he
had to take the kid to the barn.
   Baylor's ``dressing room'' to this day is a trailer parked at
one end of the coliseum.
   Once a goal weighing hundreds of pounds fell to the floor only
20 feet from where Pam Davis' Baylor womens' team was exercising.
Another time a retaining wall collapsed just yards away from where
spectators were seated.
   At least the building had a heart: Nobody was ever killed in it.
   The Bears' new coliseum is expected to be ready for Coach Gene
Iba next fall. It's going to be a compact 9,000-seater which will
put the fans within easy shouting distance of the opponents' ear
pans.
   Baylor recruiting should be a lot easier, but opponents will
never have the fear they had amidst the spiders and cobwebs in
H.O.T.
   It was the pit of pits, but on March 5th will become a nostalgic
page in Southwest Conference basketball history.

   An 82-year-old house built by an explorer,
engineer and naturalist will become the new home of the institute
that supports naturalist Jane Goodall, famous for her 28 years of
chimpanzee research.
   A variance allowing the Jane Goodall Institute to use the house
for its offices, a museum and a classroom was approved Wednesday by
the Tucson Board of Adjustment.
   The house was built by Godfrey Sykes, founder of the local
Desert Laboratory. He named it Dar es Salaam after the East African
port city he visited in 1912, said Georgiana Boyer, Sykes'
granddaughter. She said the name means ``haven of peace'' in Arabic.
   Dar es Salaam also happens to be where Ms. Goodall lives when
she's not following chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park in
Tanzania.
   ``I was amazed, just totally amazed _ it just seemed unreal _
when I heard that this house was called Dar es Salaam,'' Ms.
Goodall said in a telephone interview from Washington, D.C.
   The institute functions as Goodall's U.S. office and arranges
her annual lecture tour.
   The new headquarters will include a museum and a library
featuring Ms. Goodall's handwritten field notebooks of chimpanzee
behavior.

<HEAD>Verity Urges Action on Trade Bill; Bentsen Reports Progress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary C. William Verity urged
lawmakers Thursday to produce a major trade bill but not resort to
protectionism, while a Senate chairman reported progress in
drafting such a measure.
   ``I think we should have a trade bill and it should be a good
trade bill,'' Verity told the House Foreign Affairs Committee. He
urged the lawmakers to avoid protectionism and praised them for
moving to soften a Senate provision that would ban U.S. sales of
Toshiba products.
   The Senate included its Toshiba provision last year following
reports that a subsidiary of the Japanese electronics producer had
sold sophisticated submarine-silencing technology to the Soviet
Union.
   The administration, however, has been a critic of the provision,
and House negotiators have proposed to leave the decision up to the
president.
   ``We believe that would be the correct approach,'' Verity said.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said
House-Senate negotiators had dropped ``foreign policy'' provisions
from a compromise version of the two chambers' trade bills.
   He did not specify which provisions that involved, although
House negotiators on Tuesday proposed to delete a feature that
would strip Romania of its guarantee of trade relations with the
United States that are as good as those enjoyed by any other
country. Proponents say the provision would prod Romania to improve
its emigration policies.
   Particular interest has focused on a House offer to drop a
provision of both measures that would allow a handful of sugar
refining companies to collect from the government $400 million in
tariffs paid years ago on sugar imports that since then have been
refined and re-exported.
   Among other matters facing the senators is a House proposal to
drop import curbs on lamb. The feature, contained only in the
Senate bill, was sponsored by one of the conferees, Sen. Max
Baucus, D-Mont., who emerged from the meeting and declared that
``real progress has been made'' but provided no specifics.
   In other trade action, lawmakers from wheat-producing states
sharply questioned Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S.
Trade Representative Clayton K. Yeutter at a House Agriculture
Committee hearing.
   The two secretaries were there to discuss the proposed
free-trade agreement between the United States and Canada. One
provision of the agreement would end Canadian transportation
subsidies for wheat shipped to Vancouver but leave untouched a
subsidy for shipments to the big grain port at Thunder Bay,
Ontario. Transporation costs are a key factor in grain prices.
   American wheat growers have been complaining that the Thunder
Bay payments also should have been eliminated under the treaty,
whose major provisions would phase out tariffs between the United
States and Canada.
   Lyng and Yeutter reiterated previous pledges to consider the
Thunder Bay issue in future negotiations and repeated what they
said in earlier clashes, namely that the pact represents an
improvement in U.S.-Canadian trade relations as well as being the
best deal that American negotiators could get.
   But that did not satisfy some lawmakers.
   ``Are you still looking after the interests of U.S. agricultural
producers?'' said Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-Mont.
   ``I would give an emphatic yes,'' Lyng responded.

<HEAD>Tibetan Buddhists Begin Festival Despite Fear of Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tibetan Buddhists Thursday began their most
important religious festival, an 11-day celebration that was nearly
canceled because of fears of a repetition of last fall's violent
anti-Chinese demonstrations.
   Foreign sources in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, said the start
of the Moinlam Qenmo festival passed without incident, although
some monks were reluctant to attend the ceremonies and some people
stayed away to avoid possible trouble.
   An Indian tourist guide in Lhasa, contacted by phone, said some
monks didn't want to participate because they said fellow monks,
who led the pro-independence riots in September and October, were
still detained by Chinese police.
   The guide, who refused to give his name, said there was division
in the Tibetan community over whether to hold the religious rites
as usual this year. He could not confirm reports that some monks
boycotted the festival.
   China's official media earlier said 80 people, including monks,
were detained following the disturbances in which about 14 people
lost their lives. Official reports said almost all had been
released after repenting their actions in the riots.
   A Tibetan-speaking American, who has been in Lhasa four months,
said the city was ``a little tense'' Thursday with uniformed and
plainclothes police on patrol. He said he saw police in riot gear
at the Johkang Temple where the main ceremonies for the holiday are
taking place.
   The American, who also refused to give his name, said foreigners
have been told to return to their hotels by 10 p.m., and that
police have posted signs in English warning foreigners not to
photograph or participate in disturbances.
   The official Xinhua News Agency reported from Lhasa that
ceremonies marking the start of Moinlam Qenmo began when two lamas,
or monks, blew blasts on large trumpets from the Johkang Temple in
the center of the city.
   Xinhua said about 1,000 monks gathered at the temple to mark the
annual ``grand summons'' ceremony, and that about 1,000 people
watched in the square outside the temple.
   The news agency said that with the blowing of the trumpets
dozens of believers threw letters of good wishes tied with silk
scarves to the presiding lama and begged him to pray for their
happiness.
   Inside the temple, one of Tibetan Buddhism's holiest sites,
thousands of lamps glowed while monks prayed to Zong Kaba, founder
of the Yellow Sect of Tibetan Lamaism who started the ceremony in
1409.
   The Panchem Lama, Tibet's second-holiest man after the exiled
Dalai Lama, revealed last month that officials had considered
canceling the festival because of fears that the arrival of
thousands of pilgrims from other parts of Tibet would lead to a new
outbreak of violence.
   The communists, which took control over Tibet in 1950, claims
the remote mountainous region has been an integral part of China
for centuries.
   However, there has long been considerable friction between the
Tibetans and the Hans who are the dominant ethnic group of China,
particularly as a result of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution when
leftist Red Guards destroyed temples, suppressed local customs and
language, and persecuted religious believers.
   China blames the recent disturbances on the Dalai Lama, who fled
to India following an unsuccessful 1959 uprising and continues to
speak out against what he says are China's oppressive policies in
Tibet.
   The Beijign government has also accused the U.S. Congress, which
has called on China to stop human rights violations in Tibet, of
meddling in its internal affairs
   China has said it made mistakes during the Cultural Revolution
and has tried to make amends by rebuilding temples, guaranteeing
religious freedom and paying for development of the region, one of
the poorest in the country.

<HEAD>Army Announces Steps to Reduce Officer Corps</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Army unveiled plans Thursday for cutting
officer strength in a budget move, including appointment of a board
to select more than 350 colonels and lieutenant colonels for early
retirement.
   The service said it also was beginning a voluntary release
program for all officers regardless of rank who wanted to leave the
military, and would strictly enforce guidelines specifying the
discharge of any first lieutenant who fails for a second time to
win promotion to captain.
   The Army disclosed last week in its fiscal 1989 budget proposal
that it was cutting active-duty strength by 8,600, including about
1,540 officers. The cuts _ down to a total strength of roughly
772,000 _ were prompted by a deficit-reduction agreement reached
with Congress last November.
   Earlier this month, the Army said it would trim its enlisted
ranks through a combination of early discharges for soldiers who
were already preparing to leave the service and reductions in
recruiting goals.
   The service said Thursday it had now begun focusing on the
officer community and hoped the combination of the three new
programs would allow it to reduce those ranks without causing undue
personal hardship.
   Lt. Col. Greg Rixon, an Army spokesman, said the service
expected between 750 and 800 officers to resign or retire as part
of normal attrition. To make up the difference toward the new
target, he said:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _The Army will convene a Selective Early Retirement Board in May
to pick 178 colonels and 181 lieutenant colonels for retirement.
These are officers who have already served at least 20 years, and
thus are eligible for a pension, but had not planned to retire yet.
Those selected by the board will have to retire by Nov. 30.
   As of last Sept. 30, the Army had 4,647 colonels and 11,120
lieutenant colonels.
   _The Army will immediately start a voluntary release program for
all commissioned officers. Under this program, an officer who
decides he is ready to leave the military _ but who still ``owes''
time under a special obligation _ will be allowed to resign or
retire anyway.
   The special obligations involve extra commitments of service
stemming from such things as advanced schooling or acceptance of
lengthy overseas tours.
   Younger officers who were ``commissioned through a service
academy, ROTC or Officer Candidate School may have up to 12 months
of their service obligation waived, in exchange for 12 months of
commitment in a National Guard or Army Reserve unit,'' Rixon added.
   _Strict ``involuntary release,'' or dismissal, for certain first
lieutenants no later than Sept. 30. Rixon said a younger officer
who is passed over twice for promotion is normally discharged in
any event. Under the new program, however, there will be no
possibility of a waiver that would allow the officer to remain.

   President Reagan plans to nominate Barbara
McConnell Barrett of Phoenix, Ariz., as deputy administrator of the
Federal Aviation Administration, the White House announced Thursday.
   Ms. Barrett, 37, has been a partner in a Phoenix law firm since
1985. She was vice chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board in 1983
and 1984. She is also a former corporate attorney for the Greyhound
Corp.
   The White House also announced that the president will nominate
Kenneth J. Beirne, a former executive director of the Republican
Party of Kentucky, as assistant secretary of Housing and Urban
Development for policy development and research.
   After his service in the party position in 1981, Beirne, 41,
served in a variety of positions at HUD. He has been a free-lance
writer since last year, the White House said.
   Reagan will appoint Robert B. Barker, a former executive of the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, to the new position of
assistant to the secretary of defense for atomic energy.
   Barker, 48, was with the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency
from 1983 to 1985 and has been working on atomic energy matters at
the Pentagon since then. He was at Livermore for 10 years before
coming to Washington.
   Alex R. Munson, 46, of Saipan, North Mariana Islands, chief
justice of the High Court for the Trust Territory of the Pacific
Islands since 1982, will be nominated as judge of the District
Court for the Northern Mariana Islands, the announcement said.

   A man who had been evicted from a
retirement home burst into a board meeting at the home with two
rifles today and opened fire, wounding four people, authorities
said. A fifth person suffered a heart attack.
   The gunman fled from the room at the Masonic Home for the Aged
with one rifle tied around his neck with twine, police spokesman
Dee Anderson said. Police captured him after a chase.
   A woman who was one of the four wounded also complained of chest
pain, Anderson said.
   A fifth person, Willie Joe Wright, 67, suffered a heart attack
and was in critical condition at Arlington Memorial Hospital,
hospital spokeswoman Tenya Woods said. The other shooting victims
were in fair condition, she said.
   ``Apparently, they had a board meeting and one former resident,
who was apparently disgruntled, walked into the board room and
started shooting,'' Anderson said.
   Anderson said 16 board members were in the room.
   ``When the officers went to a kitchen in the rear of the
building, the man still had one rifle. He very calmly gave up when
the officers asked him to surrender,'' Anderson said. ``He did not
give any information to police.''
   The gunman, whose name was withheld, had lived at the home for
three years and ``was aware of the time frame of the board meeting.
He had been evicted or asked to leave,'' Anderson said.

<TEXT>
   The annual search for the nation's most
colossal cockroach is off and scurrying.
   The Combat Great American Roach-Off II came to the McNicol
Middle School Wednesday to kick off the contest, which will net the
winner $1,000 and a trip to the Smithsonian Institution's Insect
Zoo in Washington to see their roach enshrined.
   Sponsors picked the McNicol school because last year's winner,
Laine Snyder, who discovered his 2-inch-long entry under a
Hollywood Beach lifeguard stand, attended the school at the time.
   Laine has since moved, but other McNicol students hope to make
their school a winner again, even if it means changing their habits.
   ``I just step on them when I see them,'' said Eric Poirot, 13.
``I guess I better stop stepping on them if I want to win this
contest.''
   Another hopeful is Frank Alvarez, 11, who let contest
coordinator Michael ``Cockroach Dundee'' Bohdan place a hissing
3-inch monster from Madagascar onto his hand.
   ``Hey, no problem,'' he said. ``I handle lizards. This is just a
cockroach.''
   Frank plans to go roach hunting as soon as he can.
   ``I'd like to get the biggest cockroaches. My mother would
scream, though, when I brought it home.''
   He thought a moment. ``She sure wouldn't scream if I brought
home that $1,000.''
   Bohdan, a Dallas exterminator, started the contest last year to
raise awareness about roaches, which he called the most serious
pest problem in the country. The makers of Combat Roach Control
System joined Bohdan in sponsoring the contest.
   The rules: Live cockroaches need not apply. They must be dead,
but not squashed. Those much smaller than last year's winner, which
was more than 2 inches long, won't have a chance.
   Competitions will be held in May in Miami, New York, Washington,
Los Angeles, San Antonio, Texas, and Louisville, Ky. The Roach-Off
finals will be in June in New York.
   Roaches can also be mailed in strong packages _ some got
flattened in transit last year _ to Bohdan at his Pest Shop in
Plano, Texas.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Two Death Sentences, Reverses One</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The California Supreme Court today upheld
the death sentences of two men but reversed a third because the
defendant was not given a hearing on his competency to stand trial.
   The two death sentences affirmed _ one for the fatal shooting of
a couple in Los Angeles, the other for the kidnapping and fatal
stabbing of an 8-year-old girl in Hayward _ marked the first time
in recent years the court has upheld more than one death sentence
on a single day.
   The three decisions were written by Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas.
The court was unanimous in two of the cases, but split 5-2 in the
Los Angeles murder. The dissenters said the judge should not have
told jurors to disregard their ``personal choice'' and consider
only the factors listed in the law in deciding on punishment.
   Since last year, when conservatives led by Lucas gained a
majority, the court has upheld six of the 10 death sentences it has
considered.
   In the case that was reversed, Brian Darle Hale was convicted of
fatally shooting two elderly men, robbing one and attempting to rob
the other in Bellflower and Cerritos in October 1980.
   During pretrial proceedings, the court said, Hale said he was
``a president'' and a better judge than the trial judge, said he
had ``little speakers in his ears,'' and called the judge
``Fatso,'' among other rambling statements. Two court-appointed
psychiatrists concluded he was incompetent to stand trial; three
others disagreed.
   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Cecil Mills ordered a hearing
to decide whether Hale was mentally able to understand the
proceedings or assist in his own defense. But for reasons not
explained on the record, no such hearing was held before the trial
in which Hale was convicted and sentenced to death.
   The court voted 5-2 to uphold the death sentence of Eric B.
Kimble for the August 1978 fatal shootings of Harry and Avonne
Margulies in the Doheny Estates neighborhood of Los Angeles, the
rape of Mrs. Margulies and the burglary of Margulies' stereo
equipment store.
   The court unanimously affirmed the death sentence of Richard
Hovey for the March 1978 kidnapping and fatal stabbing of
8-year-old Tina Salazar in Hayward.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people stood in
driving snow Thursday on the site of a triumphant rally that
ushered in Communism in Czechoslovakia 40 years ago.
   Banners and red flags decorated the central Old Town Square,
which in 1948 resounded with the cheers of tens of thousands when
the Communists took power. Thursday's anniversary rally, however,
was short and low-key.
   On Feb. 21, 1948, Klement Gottwald gave a triumphant speech on
the square four days before taking over Czechoslovakia's first
all-Communist government.
   Thursday's crowd was subdued. Huddled under umbrellas, the
number of onlookers appeared to be less than the 80,000 people
estimated by the state news agency CTK. The banners hung limp in
the snow.
   Dozens of people drifted out of the square after party leader
Milos Jakes began a 20-minute speech recalling the ``victorious
February'' of 1948 and Czechoslovakia's sometimes troubled history
since.
   President Gustav Husak, 75, who stepped down as party leader in
December, was the first member of the ruling Politburo to take the
stand where the leadership stood sheltered from the snow.
   When Husak first appeared, nobody cheered or applauded. A few
claps were heard in the crowd once he waved.
   In his speech, Jakes remembered what he called ``dramatic
moments deciding fateful questions of our life'' in 1948.
   Forty years ago, a political crisis arose when most
non-Communist ministers in the government resigned in protest at
growing Communist influence in the security and police forces.
   Five days of well-organized street rallies and fierce political
discussions followed, ending with Gottwald becoming head of a
Communist government.
   The takeover sealed the Kremlin's domination of Eastern Europe,
and installed a Communist regime that swiftly began Stalinist-style
purges of opponents and of party ranks.
   Jakes presented the 1948 takeover as a move that ensured the
triumph of the working class over the ``oppression'' of bourgeois
democrats who ruled in Czechoslovakia before World War II.
   Looking back on the ``Prague Spring'' reforms attempted under
Alexander Dubcek in 1968, Jakes reiterated the hard line voiced in
a long speech Wednesday at a ceremony marking the anniversary.
   He again rejected any comparison between the reforms of Dubcek
20 years ago and the changes said to be under way now in
Czechoslovakia following Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms in the
Soviet Union.
   Today's changes aim to strengthen socialism, Jakes said. In
1968, he added, ``the revolutionary achievements of victorious
February and our alliance bonds with the Soviet Union and other
socialist states were threatened.
   ``Such is the historical truth and nothing substantial can be
changed in it.''
   Jakes gave little indication he is about to favor the economic
and political reforms being tried in the Soviet Union, Poland,
Hungary and Bulgaria. He also ruled out all non-communist
opposition.
   His hour-long speech to 500 party members in Prague's Hradcany
Castle did not essentially differ from the cautious conservatism
Husak displayed during his 18-year tenure.
   Jakes' speech Thursday was punctuated by few bursts of applause.
Once he finished, a loudspeaker struck up the Communist anthem,
``The Internationale,'' which was sung by some of the crowd and a
few leaders on the stand.
   Men in the gray-blue uniforms of the People's Militia and
soldiers in khaki dress uniforms marched briskly past the stand.
   In his public appearances recently, Jakes has emulated
Gorbachev's style of chatting to citizens on the streets and in
factories. He closed out the brief ceremony Thursday with thanks to
the citzens for attending and good wishes for their success at work.
   Five minutes later, the square was deserted. Television
schedules had indicated the ceremony would last 75 minutes, but it
was over in half an hour.

<HEAD>CDC Says Inspections Have Curtailed Illnesses, Despite Criticism</HEAD>

   The federal government's sanitation inspection
program for cruise ships, now 13 years old, has made a marked
difference in preventing illness among travelers, officials said
Thursday.
   The national Centers for Disease Control, which oversees
periodic inspections of cruise ships sailing regularly from U.S.
ports, reported Thursday that the percentage of ships passing
inspection rose dramatically over the program's first decade, while
the number of intestinal illness outbreaks among passengers
declined.
   Despite the positive findings, the CDC has been criticized for
reorganizing its inspection program.
   In 1975, when the program began, cruise ships were reporting 7.7
outbreaks of diarrhea for every 10 million passenger-days sailed,
said Dr. Vernon Houk, director of the agency's Center for
Environmental Health. By 1985, the figure dropped to 2.7 outbreaks
per 10 million passenger-days.
   A passenger-day is one day spent on a ship by one passenger. The
CDC considers an outbreak in progress if 3 percent of the
passengers and crew are ill.
   ``This has been a cooperative effort between us and the cruise
ship industry, and ... (the study) clearly shows it has been
working,'' Houk said. ``Things are going in the right direction.''
   Only 18 percent of the ships inspected in the first year earned
satisfactory ratings, compared with 72 percent in 1985, CDC
researchers said.
   The CDC also presented new findings Thursday indicating ``that
ships that consistently have the highest sanitation scores are less
likely to have an outbreak of diarrheal disease than ships with
lower average scores.''
   On the average, for every 10 million passenger-days, fewer than
two of the ships scoring in the top 20 percent reported diarrhea
outbreaks. That compares with outbreaks aboard more than eight of
the ships scoring in the bottom 20 percent.
   The 1975-85 results aside, critics have charged that the
program's performance has suffered since a reorganization nearly
two years ago. The CDC terminated its inspections in 1986,
substituting a plan by which the cruise lines would conduct their
own inspections. In 1987, a new plan was imposed, using private
inspectors operating under CDC review.
   According to the CDC's latest summary of the 1987 and 1988
inspections, only 55 percent of the ships regularly sailing from
U.S. ports _ 30 of 55 ships _ passed. The CDC has no legal power to
block ships from sailing, but does distribute the results of its
inspections.
   Critics have said the resent inspection results are not good
news for the ``privatization'' plan.
   Thursday, Houk said it is ``too early to draw conclusions'' from
the initial reports from the revamped program. Some ships have not
yet been inspected under the new routine.
   Houk stressed that the inspection program is thorough.
   ``Travelers ought to be aware that these are very tough
inspections,'' he said, ``far tougher than the usual restaurant
inspections done ashore.''
   The CDC inspections act as ``an independent survey'' of how well
the cruise lines' own sanitation programs are working, he added.
   ``The individual traveler should not look at a single inspection
report and make that the determinant whether he'll travel on that
ship or not,'' he said. ``It seems to me the useful question is,
`What is the past history of this ship?'''
   The CDC, in its weekly report, noted that the sanitation
inspections monitor water quality, food storage and preparation,
potential for food contamination, cleanliness and other factors.

   Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour
Hersh is coming ``because you don't normally get this interesting
mix of people.'' Former CIA director William Colby will attend
``because I think someone needs to say a few good words about the
agency.''
   Hersh and Colby are among more than 30 experts and commentators
who plan to meet Friday at Tufts University for a two-day forum on
the role of covert aid and secrecy in U.S. foreign policy.
   The panelists include former and current members of the
intelligence community, military and defense officials,
journalists, educators and legal specialists. They represent
opinions ``from the left, right and center of the ideological
spectrum,'' forum coordinator Sherman Teichman said Thursday.
   Teichman said the conference, sponsored jointly by Tufts, the
National Security Archive, the U.S. Department of Defense and the
Center for the Study of Covert Action, will address more than such
obvious examples of covert action as the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``It is important to ask if the use of covert actions is a
necessary part of dealing with foreign governments,'' he said. ``If
it is a necessary evil and used to influence others to our way of
thinking, then how does a democracy justify its actions?''
   Topics at the forum include ``The Southeast Asian Experience: A
Case Study''; ``Lessons of Vietnam and Southeast Asia for the
1980s''; ``The Iran-Contra Affair: The Hostage Ransom, Iran-Israel
Arms Sale''; and ``Contra Support: Managing and Supplying a
Paramilitary Operation.''
   Also scheduled to attend are Bob Woodward of the Washington
Post; ``Pentagon Papers'' leaker Daniel Ellsberg; Thomas Polgar, a
former CIA station chief in Saigon; former Sen. Thomas F. Eagleton
of Missouri; and Scott Armstrong, executive director of the
National Security Archive.
   ``It seems like a rather contentious group of people,'' said
Colby, now an attorney in Washington, D.C. Colby said he will
defend his opinion that ``covert action is a regular part of
American foreign policy. It's perfectly compatible with American
democracy.''
   Eagleton has prepared a paper reviewing the history of
congressional oversight of covert activities. He said the symposium
is particularly timely because of a pending Senate bill that would
plug loopholes in existing laws that allowed the Reagan
administration not to notify Congress at the time of the Iran arms
deal.
   ``There can be a time and circumstances where covert action is
clearly in the American interest,'' said Eagleton. ``But the
question is: Under what conditions of shared knowledge does our
government undertake covert action?''
   Hersh, with tongue slightly in cheek, said he has split views on
the need for covert operations.
   ``I have mixed feelings about it because on one hand, people
like me get to write books on it and make a lot of money,'' he
said. ``On the other hand, I don't see, especially when you're
talking about things like Chile, what (secret actions) have done
for the American people.''

   Producer Aaron Spelling and Fox Broadcasting
Co. are turning to the time-honored tradition of a nationwide
talent search to find the young women who will be television's new
``Charlie's Angels.''
   Young women across the country will be offered an opportunity to
land one of the four roles in ``Angels '88,'' which will make its
debut this summer on Fox.
   At least five actresses discovered during the search will be
assured of roles in at least one episode of ``Angels '88,'' a Fox
spokesman said.
   Unlike the original series, which ran on ABC from 1976 to 1981,
the new show will have four angels instead of three. Farrah
Fawcett, Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith were the original angels,
although there were cast replacements during later seasons.
   The dates and cities for the auditions are as follows: March 3,
Los Angeles; March 4, Chicago, Boston, Dallas; March 11, Miami,
Denver, San Francisco; week of March 14, open calls in 50 cities
with Fox stations; March 18, Atlanta, Detroit, Nashville, Tenn.;
March 21, New York.
   Finalists will take part in auditions in Los Angeles March 31
and the new angels will be announced April 6.
   The talent search is a Hollywood tradition that goes back to the
search for an actress to play Scarlett O'Hara in ``Gone With the
Wind'' 50 years ago. At the last minute British actress Vivian
Leigh was selected to star opposite Clark Gable.
   The Disney Studio is also conducting a nationwide talent hunt
for youngsters who look like the original Mousketeers for a movie
about the ``Mickey Mouse Club.''

   A former firefighter admitted setting a
series of arson fires that burned a small town's elementary school
and two churches that opened their doors to students, a prosecutor
said today.
   Adrian Julius Howe, 23, of Omak will be charged with six counts
of first-degree arson, prosecutor Jack Burchard said. He was held
in the Okanogan County Jail.
   Howe admitted setting the fires, which caused $6.5 million in
damage, Burchard said. Each arson count carries a possible sentence
of life imprisonment and a $50,000 fine.
   Officials declined to comment on reports that Howe held a grudge
against the burned school, North Omak Elementary School.
   The six fires that began in December and hit the school twice in
eight days led to the creation of a 12-member arson task force and
door-to-door canvassing in search of leads. Two churches and a
church house were also burned; one of the churches was struck twice.
   Howe was arrested Wednesday, said Mimi Curry of the state
Department of Community Development's division of fire protection
services, who has been appointed spokeswoman for the investigation.
   The task force, set up Tuesday and composed of local, state and
U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents, was ``at a
peak of activity,'' with investigators going door-to-door, Ms.
Curry said.
   The string of arsons terrorized Omak, a placid north-central
Washington town of 4,000. Churches and schools stepped up security,
and residents formed night-time patrols.
   Howe's mother, Lena Howe, 67, said she and her 75-year-old
husband, Ben, adopted their son at age 2. He had learning
difficulties and left Omak High School in his junior year, the
mother told The Spokesman-Review in today's editions of the Spokane
newspaper.
   Howe later got a job on the fire patrol in nearby Nespelem, but
was not rehired after he lost his driver's license because of
drinking problems, Mrs. Howe said. He now works at a lumber mill on
the Colville Indian reservation, just east of Omak, Mrs. Howe said.
   Colville Indian Reservation tribal chief Harry Smiskin said Howe
was a firefighter for the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs' fire
control department. He said he gave details of Howe's employment to
investigators.
   The Washington state House voted Wednesday night to include in
its $207 million supplemental state budget a $150,000 appropriation
to help Omak and Okanogan County pay for investigation of the
blazes.
   If fully approved, the money would be used for administrative
costs to complete the arson investigation, Ms. Curry said.
   ``The (Okanogan) county budget is being quickly depleted,'' she
said. ``After all, they (county commissioners) didn't plan for this
(the arson fires) to happen.''

<HEAD>Bush Campaigns Against Textile Bill in South Carolina</HEAD>

   George Bush took on a hot issue in a
state that could be a Republican indicator for the rest of the
South Thursday, rejecting as ``pure, all-out protectionism''
efforts backed by rivals Bob Dole and Pat Robertson to help the
textile industry by limiting foreign imports.
   Bush said he opposed legislation that has been sought by many in
South Carolina and other textile states as a cure for the
industry's troubles. His comments came one day after Dole
campaigned in the same area and called for the bill's passage.
   ``I'm for the textile industry _ not the bill,'' the vice
president said while greeting several hundred people alongside a
Greenwood street. ``There have got to be some changes before I'd be
for it.''
   ``Don't go for this pure, all-out protectionism that may save
one job and then throw three neighbors in this burgeoning state out
of work,'' Bush said earlier at a technical college in Pendleton,
S.C. ``That's not the answer.''
   Bush turned aside most questions about his long-distance
exchange with Pat Robertson over the past two days. But he said the
former TV evangelist hadn't responded to his demand for an apology
or proof ``by sundown in the Old South'' to back up Robertson's
suggestion that the release of sex-scandal allegations against
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart had been timed to hurt Robertson.
   ``Haven't heard a word,'' Bush said. ``I've said all I'm going
to say about that.''
   Robertson, in Louisville, Ky., said he'd been misquoted and
suggested Bush wouldn't be asking for an aplogy if he knew what
Robertson had really said.
   Bush spoke about the textile issue to several hundred teachers,
students and others at an assembly at Tri-County Technical College,
on a day when he toured the northwestern corner of South Carolina
by motorcade and stopped at high schools, colleges and restaurants.
   Dole and Robertson support legislation that would place limits
on the amount of foreign textile products that could be imported.
The legislation is popular in textile-producing areas, but
President Reagan vetoed similar legislation after it was passed by
Congress more than two years ago.
   ``What I propose is that we enforce the law,'' Bush said.
``Sometimes we're fighting the bureaucracy in Washington. We have
the laws on the books _ enforce it, so that the textile industry
will continue to profit.''
   At evey stop Bush underscored the importance he and others
attach to South Carolina in the race for the Republican nomination.
The state holds its GOP primary on Saturday March 5, with 37
delegates at stake. But the state is given broader significance
because it comes three days before the rest of the South votes on
Super Tuesday, a day when one-third of the delegates in both
parties will be up for grabs.
   Robertson has said he must win in South Carolina and has devoted
an intensive effort. Bush has long considered it one of his best
states in the South, since he has broad party support including
that of Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr., who accompanied him at his
stops.
   Bush would like a win going into the Super Tuesday states, after
finishing far behind in South Dakota and Minnesota contests last
Tuesday, and he was spending two days campaigning here this week.
   Dole, the Kansas senator, also contesting here, was accompanied
in the state on Wednesday by Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond.
   Bush dropped in on an industrial electronics class where about
30 students interrupted their final examination to hear him speak
briefly and watch as he observed a demonstration of a small,
computer-driven robotics machine.
   He sought to tie himself closely to Reagan at his stops in this
state where the president has been a popular vote-getter. He said,
``I've taken some shots'' for remaining loyal to Reagan, ``but you
and I know loyalty is a strength, not a weakness.''

<TEXT>
   Major U.S. oil companies doing regular
business with Saudi Arabia are turning to Britain for protection of
their tankers against Iranian attacks in the Persian Gulf, shipping
executives and diplomatic sources said Thursday.
   The sources said the move by such corporations as Chevron and
Mobil apparently was prompted by loss of hope that the U.S. Navy's
escort operations would be expanded to cover U.S.-owned or operated
vessels that don't fly the American flag. The sources spoke on
condition they not be identified.
   They said Chevron and Mobil recently registered five
supertankers in Bermuda under the Red Ensign, flag of the British
merchant marine, and Exxon Corporation had brought its
Bahamas-registered Esso Atlantic out of four years' retirement to
carry crude to the United States. The 516,893-ton ship is one of
the world's three or four largest.
   Exxon already has about a dozen supertankers flying the British
flag, and another five sailing under the French flag.
   France, Britain, Italy and the Soviet Union also have naval
escort contingents in the gulf.
   Two Chevron-owned vessels, the 413,158-ton Chevron South America
and the 264,000-ton Chevron Edinburgh, were shifted from Liberian
to Bermudan registry in December. The vessels routinely operate
between Saudi Arabia's Ras Tanura terminal and a Chevron refinery
in Pascagoula, Miss. The Chevron fleet is estimated at 48, mainly
under Liberian registry.
   Mobil, with a 28-vessel fleet, has transferred three
Liberian-flagged tankers to Bermudan. They are the 277,000-ton
Mobil Falcon, the 280,428-ton Mobil Petrol and the 138,496-ton
Mobil Acme, which also routinely carry Saudi crude to the United
States.
   The U.S. Navy's Middle East Force mainly protects 11 state-owned
Kuwaiti tankers re-registered last year in the United States. Only
one of the Kuwaiti ships is a crude oil tanker, and none of them
sails regularly to the United States, which derives only 6 percent
of its oil imports directly from gulf sources.
   Although the Navy may escort any U.S.-flag vessel, few enter the
waterway, where nearly 500 ships have been hit or damaged since the
Iraq-Iran war began in September 1980 and spread to the gulf four
years ago.
   Iran strikes at neutral vessels in the 600-mile waterway in
retaliation for Iraqi raids on its own tanker routes.
   Following an increase in Iranian attacks last year, American
shipowners with vessels registered under other ``flags of
convenience'' for tax and other purposes, or carrying cargo to and
from the United States under other flags, urged the Pentagon to let
the Navy escort their vessels.
   The pressure increased just before the new U.S. defense
secretary, Frank Carlucci, visited the gulf last month to reassess
the Navy role.
   However, the policy of escorting only U.S.-flagged vessels was
subsequently reaffirmed, at the same time that Carlucci announced a
slight cutback in the number of U.S. warships in the gulf and
nearby waters.
   ``The U.S. escort operations for reflagged Kuwaiti tankers have
been a success and the Americans do not want to spoil it,'' said
one of the shipping sources.
   The U.S. administration apparently has stressed to shipowners
that protection would be given only to ships flying the American
flag and therefore subject to U.S. taxes and laws requiring
American crews. Under United Kingdom registry, vessels must have
British captains but are sheltered from taxation.
   Because Britain's gulf force sails only as far north as Bahrain,
halfway up the gulf, ships it escorts would be on their own if
heading to Ras Tanura, or to Saudi or Kuwait ports farther north.
   A knowledgeable shipping source in regular contact with oil
companies in Saudi Arabia said there was ``no need for British
escort beyond Bahrain'' because Saudi Arabia's navy had made the
area secure. He refused to elaborate.

   Israel tightened security in its capital
Thursday for the visit of Secretary of State George P. Shultz,
setting up roadblocks, searching Arabs' homes and rounding up
scores of suspected agitators.
   In Silwan at the foot of the Mount of Olives, military police in
an armored vehicle searched for Palestinians on foot and in cars,
pulling vinyl seat cushions out of vehicles and emptying the
contents of trunks onto a dirt road.
   At least nine people were hospitalized with beating injuries
after military police sealed off the Shufat refugee camp within the
city limits and then broke into homes searching for Arabs suspected
of taking part in disturbances, hospital officials said.
   Five Palestinians were detained, according to Arab reports.
   During the operation, an Associated Press photographer heard the
sound of rubber bullets and several rounds of live ammunition being
fired in the camp.
   The security crackdown, which began earlier this week, has sent
hundreds of military police into Arab villages incorporated into
Jerusalem after the 1967 Middle East war.
   The army said 114 Arabs have been detained in the last four
days, including 21 minors.
   The police force has been doubled to 3,000 and the army was
authorized to help enforce order in mostly Arab east Jerusalem for
the first time since it was annexed by Israel after 1967, the army
and municipal officials said.
   ``The people in these villages for the last two months thought
they belonged to Palestine. We are teaching them they live in
Israel and they will never forget it,'' a senior police officer
said. ``We are throwing the book at them: traffic violations, drug
trafficking, not paying taxes.''
   In Al Essawieh, a village of unpaved streets abutting the
wealthy Jewish neighborhood of French Hill, riot police ran checks
Thursday of Arabs entering or leaving and detained those whose
names appeared on a computerized list.
   Shafikh Ali Obeid, 57, said his son, Faisal, a 33-year-old taxi
driver, was held by police for 24 hours Wednesday because he was on
the list for not paying last year's municipal taxes.
   ``They took the keys to his car and took him away in a police
van,'' Obeid said. He said his son was released after he paid a
$1,500 fine, part of which will be applied to pay his tax bill.
   Obeid said the taxes did not appear to provide services to
Palestinians. Pointing to the garbage-filled streets and a greenish
stream of open sewage, he complained of the poor quality of
municipal services.
   Garbage pickup service has been stopped since January in Al
Essawieh and other Arab villages because residents stoned municipal
trucks.
   ``It is a very difficult time to pay taxes because most people
haven't worked since the unrest began. The Israelis know that,''
Obeid said.
   ``It's another way to put the squeeze on us for adhering to the
commercial strike,'' he said. ``The roundups are also a message to
us to keep in line during the Shultz visit.''

   Secretary of State George P. Shultz urged
Israel on Thursday to negotiate a prompt and final agreement with
the Arabs about the violence-plagued occupied territories.
   He said the 21-year Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip was the main reason for unrest that has cost at least 65
lives since Dec. 8.
   ``Its fundamental origin is essentially indigenous,'' Shultz
said on the flight from Washington to begin a five-day peace
shuttle in which he will present U.S. proposals to the Israelis and
Arabs.
   Shultz would give no details, but said his approach to both
sides will go far beyond an interim arrangement for the occupied
lands, where 1.5 million Palestinians live.
   Egypt, Jordan and several other Arab nations have told the
United States they reject the 1978 Camp David formula for self-rule
in the territories.
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt called the plan, which helped
produce the March 1979 peace treaty between his country and Israel,
``a thing of the past whose time has ended.''
   On the plane, Shultz told reporters ``final status issues'' must
be taken up promptly, and ``we have a proposal for that.''
   It is understood to be a two-step plan that would loosen Israeli
controls immediately and lead to negotiations for a final
settlement, even Palestinian statehood, by December.
   The secretary said the ``underlying problem'' in the West Bank
and Gaza is that people ``don't have the basic rights of
governance.''
   President Reagan said at a news conference Wednesday night some
of the violence was inspired from outside. He cited intelligence
reports but gave no details.
   Shultz said the intelligence reports provide a ``mixed
picture,'' including interaction with outside forces.
   In order to deal with the main problem, he said, ``we seek among
other things, consistent with Israel's security, to look at things
that would help Palestinians gain legitimate rights.''
   Israeli control does not lend itself to ``a stable situation''
in the West Bank and Gaza, he said.
   A ``fundamental touchstone'' of his plan are resolutions passed
by the U.N. Security Council in 1967 and 1973 calling on Israel to
cede territory in exchange for acceptance by its Arab neighbors,
Shultz said.
   The secretary said the U.S. package is not like a ``cafeteria,''
permitting the sides to choose elements they like and reject the
others.
   He also rejected a Soviet proposal for an international
conference in which the superpowers would play an active role,
contending such arrangements are not likely to produce ``good
results.''
   Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, who had urged Washington
for months to be more forceful, greeted Shultz at the airport and
said: ``There is no better alternative than to make the first step
toward the long march to bring peace to our people and our area.''
   Peres said Israelis were in the ``most demanding period in our
life.''
   Shultz responded: ``Now is the time to work for peace and I'm
convinced I'm bringing with me a workable proposal.''
   The big question is what Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir will say
to Shultz when they meet on Friday. Until now, Shamir has resisted
the ``territory for peace'' formula long advocated by the State
Department.
   On Saturday, Shultz goes to Amman to see Zaid Rifai, Jordan's
prime minister, and Damascus for talks with President Hafez Assad
of Syria.
   In the past, Shultz accused Syria of sponsoring terrorism and
said it should be isolated. Reagan imposed sanction in 1986,
including a ban on meetings between high-level U.S. and Syrian
officials.
   Shultz explained his decision to visit Damascus by saying: ``In
the first place the Syrian involvement in terrorism seems to have
diminished, and we have had some definite moves that have been made
that we found encouraging.
   ``I don't mean to say the problem is resolved. But that was the
basic problem. Beyond that, as we try to find our way to something
that can be helpful in the region, we recognize that Syria is an
important state.''

   Sidney Poitier says he has worked hard during
his 38-year-career to be considered just an actor, not a black
actor.
   ``Today we have Eddie Murphy, Denzel Washington, Richard Pryor,
Bill Cosby and James Earl Jones,'' said Hollywood's first black
leading man.
   ``We have a lot of black actors who are working. I am now
finally just another actor, and that is a hallowed place to be,''
Poitier says in the Sunday issue of Parade magazine.
   During an interview on the set of ``Shoot to Kill,'' his latest
film, Poitier reminisced about his mother and his poverty-filled
youth growing up in the Bahamas.
   ``When a mother would be giving her son a whipping for one thing
or another, she'd say, `Don't do that to the boy. Leave him alone
and let his mind work. That's the way my young Sidney was _ and
look what happened to him.'
   ``Hearing that was one of the best rewards I ever had,'' said
Poitier.

   Ilona Staller, better known as Cicciolina, the porn
star who was elected to Pariliament last year, faced new legal
problems Thursday as prosecutors pressed cases to bring her to
trial on obscenity charges.
   Rome chief's prosecutor, Marco Boschi, announced that he has
asked the Chamber of Deputies to lift Ms. Staller's parliamentary
immunity so she can be tried on charges of conspiring with other
people to produce obscene publications and take part in live shows.
   Only Parliament can decide whether one of its members can be
brought to trial.
   The Rome case is one of three pending against the Hungarian-born
Ms. Staller, who was elected on the Radical Party Ticket.
   Earlier this week, a prosecutor in Venice sent Parliament video
tapes of Ms. Staller riding bare-breasted on horseback through St.
Mark's Square last September. Another case regards photos of her in
a magazine.
   Ms. Staller has often said she would welcome a trial to
demonstrate what she calls the hypocrisy of Italy's laws defining
obscenity.

<HEAD>Congressman Says Commerce Department Making `Power Grab' In Space</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the House space subcommittee said
Thursday the Commerce Department may be trying a ``power grab'' by
granting a Massachusetts company an export license for an
experiment that is to be flown aboard the Soviet Union's Mir space
station.
   ``It's no secret that since space is a sexy subject that the
Department of Commerce wants to get its fingers into the
jurisdiction of space,'' Rep. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., said at a news
conference.
   ``Is this another power grab of trying to get into the space
business?'' an angry Nelson asked.
   Nelson said he was angry that Commerce granted an export license
to Payload Systems Inc. of Wellesley, Mass., for a protein crystal
growth experiment to be carried on the Mir without consulting with
NASA, the Transportation Department or Congress.
   The Florida Democrat said he was very concerned about decisions
being made by U.S. agencies ``who may not understand the full
implications of their decisions upon the civilian and military
space programs of this country.''
   He said there are a number of questions that need to be answered
about the Payload Systems plans and added, ``I want the whole
process put on hold until those questions can be answered.''
   Payload Systems was granted a license to export an experiment to
test techniques for growing protein crystals in weightlessness.
Such experiments have been conducted on American spacecraft in the
past, including the 1986 shuttle flight taken by Nelson. But the
U.S. spacefleet now is grounded and the Soviet spacecraft are the
only manned vehicles now available to experimenters.
   Byron K. Lichtenberg, who flew on the shuttle in 1983 as a
non-astronaut experimenter, founded Payload Systems and has
designed the experiment. The firm contacted the Soviets about
flying it on the Mir in March 1987 and then applied in October to
the Commerce Department for an export license. The license was
approved early this month.
   Nelson said that although the Commerce Department consulted with
some people in the Defense Department, it did not consult with the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of
Transportation _ both of which have responsibilites in space _ nor
with Congress.
   The Commerce Department's unilateral decision, he said, has
``ominous implications'' for the future of the U.S. space program.
   Nelson released a letter to Commerce Secretary William Verity in
which he said the process followed for the Payload Systems license
was ``confusing and must be clarified.'' He asked Verity to appear
at a subcommittee hearings on the subject, to provide information
on specific questions about the license.
   The federal government last year refused permission for General
Motors and General Electric to launch American-made communications
satellites on Soviet rockets on the basis that it could result in a
technology transfer to the Soviets.
   Nelson said he fears that Payload Systems' protein crystal
growth experiment could give technology to the Soviets.
   ``I understand enough about the (crystal growth) process that I
know there are questions that ought to be asked before we start
giving away insights into how to do this process,'' he said. Nelson
said the process may have ``important military applications.''
   But Payload Systems research director Anthony P. Arrott said
Sunday that the experiment was to investigate only protein
crystals, bits of organic matter that can be used in medical and
biological research.
   Neither Arrott or Lichtenberg were available Thursday to comment
on Nelson's statements. A secretary at the Wellesley office said
neither man was at the office and that they were not reachable by
telephone.

   A witness instrumental in an indictment of
Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega was sentenced
Thursday to 14 years in prison without parole for his part in a
drug-smuggling, money-laundering ring.
   ``Today I would like to apologize to this court and to the
United States for my crimes,'' Steven Michael Kalish told U.S.
District Judge W. Terrell Hodges in an hour-long hearing. He asked
for a ``compassionate sentence,'' promising he ``would not betray
that trust.''
   Kalish, 35, who told congressional investigators last month he
personally handed Noriega a briefcase containing a $300,000 payoff,
previously pleaded guilty to running a continuing criminal
enterprise.
   Prosecutors agreed to a cap of 20 years on what could have been
a life sentence without parole during a plea agreement struck last
March in the 1984 case, said Robert T. Kennedy, chief of the
criminal division of the Tampa U.S. Attorney's office. Kalish
agreed to forfeit $2.8 million in cash and possessions as part of
the bargain.
   ``Without his cooperation, the recent indictment (of Noriega)
would not have been possible at this time,'' the government said in
a sentencing memorandum filed earlier in the week.
   In court, Kennedy acknowledged Kalish's cooperation had been
substantial, but added that didn't diminish the seriousness of his
crimes.
   Hodges said he had ``no difficulty in substantially mitigating
the sentence'' because of Kalish's cooperation and remorse, but
noted a previous conviction in Texas and gave him 14 years without
parole.
   A recommendation of where Kalish would serve his sentence was
suppressed by the court at the request of defense attorneys, who
said their client's life was in danger.
   ``The danger is specifically that he's testified against
Panamanian strongma Manuel Noriega, who is known for having been
violent in the past toward people he deems his enemies,'' Kalish's
attorney, Alan Ellis, said outside the courtroom.
   Kalish has been in federal custody since his arrest in July
1984. He pleaded guilty to being the field supervisor of a
Tampa-based smuggling ring founded by Leigh Bruce Ritch that
smuggled record amounts of Colombian marijuana through Panama.
   Ritch was convicted and is serving a 30-year sentence without
parole.
   Noriega, who is chief of the Panamanian Defense Forces, and
business associate Enrique Pretelt were indicted Feb. 4 by a grand
jury in Tampa for allegedly taking $4 million in payoffs from
Kalish and Ritch to protect their operation.
   Noriega also was charged with laundering more than $100 million
of the ring's profits, partly through a corporation he controlled.
   The same day, a grand jury in Miami indicted Noriega on
racketeering charges accusing him of taking at least $4.6 million
from Colombia's Medellin Cartel to protect 8,800 pounds in cocaine
shipments.
   In January, Kalish told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigation that he paid Noriega more than $1 million in bribes
and agreed to pay $3 million more on behalf of the ring, including
leaving a briefcase containing $300,000 in cash the first time he
met the general.

   United Airlines Inc. has paid an $11,000 civil
penalty to settle 1987 charges that it violated federal
transportation standards involving shipments of live animals, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The penalty was assessed by the department in an administrative
action stemming from nine shipments of dogs and monkeys in 1985 and
1986. A complaint was filed against United last year by the
department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which
administers the Animal Welfare Act.
   James W. Glosser, acting administrator of the agency, said the
complaints alleged that United had accepted dogs in shipping
kennels that did not conform to size requirement, and that the
airline ``either failed to observe and care for the dogs properly''
or stowed them in cargo space without sufficient ventiliation.
   Two dogs died during shipment and another was killed by highway
traffic after it escaped shipment, Glosser said. The airline also
was cited for having ``allegedly accepted a shipment of 50 monkeys
in cages that were not structurally sound'' and had no markings to
tell they contained wild animals, he said.
   Other allegations included the company's failure to ``move dogs
expeditiously from an animal holding area to an airplane'' and to
keep shipping containers in an upright position during unloading
operations.
   Glosser said United consented to a cease-and-desist order
against future violations of the act and agreed within a year to
buy a training film approved by USDA and show it to all employees
who handle live animal cargoes.

<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court refused Thursday to
allow immediate enforcement of a new California law requiring
consent of parents or a judge for an abortion by an unmarried woman
under 18.
   The court's unanimous action apparently means the law, blocked
from taking effect Jan. 1 by a Superior Court judge's order, will
remain unenforced this year while its constitutionality is
challenged.
   Major doctors' organizations and family-planning groups contend
the law violates the right to privacy under the state Constituion
by restricting minors' ability to decide on their own whether to
give birth or get an abortion.
   The law, sponsored by anti-abortion groups, would make it a
crime for a doctor to perform an abortion on an unmarried minor
living at home who did not have written consent from one parent.
   As an alternative to parental consent, the minor could get a
ruling from a judge, after a confidential hearing, that the
abortion was in her best interest or that she was mature enough to
make the decision on her own.
   State officials say about 34,000 women under 18 had abortions in
1985, the latest year for which figures are available. Under the
old law, which remains in effect, a woman of any age can consent to
an abortion as long as her doctor concludes she understands the
procedure and is consenting voluntarily.
   San Francisco Superior Court Judge Morton Colvin issued a
preliminary injunction Dec. 28 prohibiting enforcement of the new
law until a trial could be held on its constitutionality. He said
the law would cause irreparable harm if enforced in the meantime,
and found a reasonable likelihood it would ultimately be ruled
invalid.
   The state's 1st District Court of Appeal let Colvin's order
stand. Attorney General John Van de Kamp, the lead defendant in the
suit as the state's top law enforcement officer, then appealed to
the state Supreme Court, asking the court to take over the case and
to allow enforcement of the law while the suit is pending.

   George Bush scored political points by
depicting Sen. Bob Dole as a supporter of tax hikes, but both
Republican presidential hopefuls have waffled on this volatile
issue in the past.
   Bush acquiesced in the notion of increasing taxes last fall
though he said he didn't like it. He now maintains that he, as
president, would not raise taxes.
   Dole supported the sweeping reduction in tax rates in 1981, but
helped enact a $98.3 billion tax hike a year later. He now bridles
at conservative portrayals of him as willing to support tax
legislation.
   Dole said Bush was ``lying about my record'' in a commercial
that said Dole would readily raise taxes.
   The ad damaged Dole's chances in New Hampshire. Dole admitted
later that he should have responded. He also evidently harmed
himself by brushing aside Pete du Pont's debate challenge to sign a
no-tax pledge.
   The argument revolves about the murky area of the candidates'
intentions with respect to future tax increases, mostly because
neither Bush nor Dole can cite a record of having consistently
opposed such hikes.
   Barry Bosworth, a Brookings Institution fellow who once headed
President Carter's Council of Economic Advisers, said that to the
extent Bush's commercial raised doubts about Dole's tax intentions,
voters ``responded because they vote their pocketbook.''
   The Dole campaign has put forth a truth squad to monitor Bush's
commericals during the balance of the campaign, and the Bush camp
continues to deny that it distorted the senator's position on taxes.
   But the record is full of inconsistencies regarding both general
tax increases and the question of imposing an import fee on foreign
oil.
   During the 1980 campaign, Bush labeled as ``voodoo economics''
Reagan's pledge to restore U.S. military might while cutting taxes
and balancing the budget. But the record shows no evidence of a
Bush dissent from tax increases that Reagan has signed in the
ensuing years.
   In fact, the closest Bush came to a dissent was when he told a
crowd in Iowa last November that while he didn't like the tax hikes
envisioned in the deficit-reduction package, ``I'll support
whatever compromise the president makes.''
   Bush also slipped last October by launching his presidential
campaign with an uncompromising pledge to not raises taxes, only to
subsequently leave the door slightly ajar. In an Oct. 15 interview
on Cable News Network, Bush backtracked from his Oct. 12 Houston
promise.
   ``What I have said is, if I were convinced that all spending
that could possibly be constrained or cut had taken place, then and
only then would I consider a tax increase,'' he said. Later in the
same day, when pressed for an explanation, Bush replied, ``I'm not
going to raise taxes, period.''
   The record shows that Dole supported various deficit-reduction
tax hike proposals, including the $98.3 billion package in 1981, a
$50.6 billion program in 1984 and the $22 billion in hikes
contained in a plan Reagan agreed to last Nov. 20 in the wake of
the Wall Street crash.
   But Dole and his supporters complained bitterly about the Bush
commercials in New Hamsphire _ ads which Sen. Warren Rudman of New
Hampshire called a ``misstatement of (Dole's) record.''
   Both Bush and Dole have made statements which seemed to indicate
at least a willingness to consider an oil import fee, although Dole
says he voted against it five times since 1980, and Bush said ``an
oil import fee is not the way to decrease dependence'' on foreign
oil.
   Bush talks frequently of a need to lessen U.S. reliance on
foreign oil, but discusses only generally the notion of
strengthening the American petroleum industry. An oil import fee
would do that.
   Dole's spokeswoman, Katie Boyle, recently sought to clarify
statements he made indicating he would consider such a fee, saying
that it would have to carry a rebate provision for consumers.
   Bosworth said in times of general economic prosperity,
candidates for political office score big points by suggesting an
opponent would raise taxes.
   ``I think Dole has probably learned from this (loss in New
Hampshire),'' he said. ``It appears Republicans voted for Bush
there because he appeared to be more adamant about not raising
taxes than Dole was.''
   Larry Sabato, a political science professor and presidential
scholar at the University of Virginia, said ``this (Bush) succeeded
only because Dole chose not to respond to it. It was very
uncharacteristic of him.''
   ``Bush has no position. Dole has a record, which includes
revenue increases in concert with the administration,'' said Bob
McIntyre of the private group, Citizens for Tax Justice.
   Martin Anderson, who served as a domestic policy adviser in the
Reagan White House during the first term, said ``my recollection
is'' that Bush was an even more ardent supporter of tax cuts than
was Reagan.
   ``In fact, he is pushing more, including seeking the cut in
capital gains taxes,'' Anderson said of the vice president.

   Outgoing President Chun Doo-hwan held
the hand of his 2-year-old granddaughter Thursday as he left the
presidential mansion after seven years in power.
   Looking strained, Chun shook hands with a long line of aides and
officials in the grounds of the Blue House. Occasionally he flashed
a tense smile as he quietly said farewell.
   Less than an hour earlier, Chun had sat in front of the National
Assembly and watched Roh Tae-woo take the oath of office as the
country's new president. The two men then returned to the Blue
House in the center of Seoul for Chun's formal departure.
   It was the first time in South Korea's turbulent 40-year history
that a president had left power peacefully. Officials who arranged
the ceremony said it had been a problem working out what to do
since there was no precedent to follow.
   Chun, who is to serve as an honorary presidential adviser, was
widely disliked for his tough rule and suppression of opposition.
   ``It is still hard to believe he is leaving. It is so quiet,''
said one man watching the departure ceremony that was nationally
televised.
   Roh watched briefly from the doorway as Chun left the mansion
and then went inside. Chun remained outside for a few minutes
shaking hands and then drove off.
   Hundreds of security guards and officials lined sidewalks at the
main gate and applauded as Chun drove away. He waved back as the
car sped past.
   Life at the heavily guarded Blue House quickly returned to
normal after Chun left. Squads of soldiers resumed patrolling the
mansion and its grounds.
   Chun had said repeatedly in recent weeks that he was eager to
leave office after seven taxing years. He said he had no regrets
and had never wanted to be president.
   ``Now is the time for me to leave the stage of history, the time
to be released from the bondage of public life, the time to be free
from the oppressive solitude of the executive office,'' he said in
a farewell address Wednesday night.
   Chun, Roh and other generals took power in 1980 following the
assassination of President Park Chung-hee. Roh was elected to
succeed Chun in December in the first democratic presidential vote
in 16 years.
   Some people cheered the ex-president as he returned to his home
in Seoul. They waved Korean flags and a band of folk dancers
performed a welcoming dance.
   Other spectators complained later to newspapers that they had
been ordered to take part in the ceremony.

   United Auto Workers union officials today
threatened to block special agreements at six Chrysler Corp. plants
in an effort to discourage the sale of the company's parts-making
division.
   In addition, the union threatened to suspend other programs that
call for cooperation between labor and management at plants
nationwide to persuade the nation's No. 3 automaker to keep Acustar
Inc.
   About 140 local union delegates and members today approved a
resolution calling for the suspension of the team concept operating
agreements, under which a single group of workers is assigned to
put together parts of a car. The traditional American process
involves one worker doing a single task on an assembly line.
   The union is bound by contract to honor the agreements at plants
in Huntsville, Ala.; Indianapolis; Newcastle, Ind.; Newark, Del.;
Trenton, N.J.; and Detroit. So far, the agreements are in effect
only in Huntsville, Indianapolis and Newcastle.
   But the union is looking for ways to block the agreements, UAW
vice president Marc Stepp said. He did not elaborate.
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca said Feb. 4 that Chrysler was
entertaining offers to sell all or part of the $3-billion division,
saying the company no longer wanted to invest in the research

<HEAD>Chicago Parents End School Protest of 250 Student Demotions</HEAD>

   A three-day student walkout at an academically
troubled elementary school ended Thursday after the principal
compromised on her get-tough decision to demote 250 students to
lower grade levels.
   Parents had kept an estimated 400 students out of classes at
Beethoven Elementary School since Monday to protest the demotions
of students whose reading skills were below grade level on
standardized achievement tests.
   But they ended the boycott after Principal Grace Dawson agreed
to return demoted students to their original grade levels if their
parents met individually with her and helped teachers devise
reading-improvement plans.
   Ms. Dawson said Thursday most of the school's 830 students were
back in class and that about 150 of the demoted students had been
returned to their original grade levels.
   But she said 100 students hadn't been reinstated. In some cases,
the parents had agreed to the demotions. In others, she said, the
students wouldn't be reinstated until their parents went to the
school for conferences.
   Cynthia Thomas, whose 10-year-old daughter Tamika had been
demoted from fourth to third grade, said she thought the boycott
had accomplished the parents' goal, but that the children also
would benefit.
   ``They're going to get some extra tutoring and some extra
reading programs for our kids.''
   The principal said she ordered the mass demotions because so
many of Beethoven's students were several years behind in learning
to read. Most of them live in the nearby Robert Taylor Homes, the
nation's largest high-rise public housing project, located in a
South Side neighborhood rife with crime and street gangs.
   ``Sometimes drastic action has to take place to break the ice,''
Ms. Dawson she said Thursday.
   When the demotions took effect Feb. 15, students were not
shifted to other classrooms, but were taught materials and subjects
from the lower grades.
   In some cases, entire classrooms were taught at a lower grade
level, Ms. Dawson said.
   Ms. Dawon said the demoted students scored from two years to
four years behind grade level on the Iowa Basic Skills Test given
last year and on the Metropolitan Achievement Test given in January.
   ``I will not be a party to passing students on to the next grade
who aren't qualified,'' she said. ``As a professional educator, I
will not sit back and say there's nothing we can do. Otherwise, the
children are the losers.''
   The principal said her get-tough policy worked by forcing
parents to become involved in their children's education.
   Since Wednesday, Ms. Dawson said she had met with about 60
parents to discuss the demotions. She said about 25 percent agreed
to leave their children at the lower gade level for the rest of the
year.
   ``I'm happy because we can't do anything to improve education
without parental support,'' she added.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Nominee Says He'd Drop Controversial Views If Seated</HEAD>

   A conservative judicial nominee told senators
Thursday he would discard his unorthodox views and follow Supreme
Court precedent if confirmed, but the same liberals who opposed
Robert H. Bork expressed doubts that he would keep the promise.
   In a pledge similar to that made by Bork in his tumultuous
confirmation hearing, nominee Bernard Siegan said he would
``observe the law of the land'' and added, ``I would resign'' if
unable to do so.
   Siegan, a 63-year-old professor at the University of San Diego
Law School, is President Reagan's nominee for the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
   The circuit, on which new Supreme Court justice Anthony M.
Kennedy served, has jurisdiction over Alaska, Arizona, California,
Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Guam and the
Northern Mariana Islands.
   Siegan told the Senate Judiciary Committee, ``There are times I
will rule contrary to my own feelings. It would be a direct
violation and contrary of my oath to push my position ahead of the
Supreme Court.''
   In his confirmation hearings last year, Bork was unable to
convince senators he would put aside his controversial writings,
and he suffered a crushing defeat in the Senate by a 58-42 vote.
   Siegan's free-wheeling views do not always parallel those of
Bork, but he's just as controversial when writing on subjects such
as civil rights, economic law, separation of church and state, and
equal protection for women.
   As the hearing ended, People for the American Way, which had
opposed Bork vigorously, attacked Siegan in a statement.
   ``Bernard Siegan spent the morning distancing himself from his
entire body of legal scholarship,'' the group said. But Sen. Orrin
G. Hatch, R-Utah, who was one of Bork's main supporters, told
Siegan, ``I hope people will give you a fair shake.''
   Siegan's testimony did not convince to Bork opponents: Sens.
Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.
   Leahy questioned Siegan's almost total lack of experience in
federal courtrooms. ``The last time you were in federal court (35
years ago) I was 12 years old.''
   Metzenbaum told Siegan, ``I'm concerned that if confirmed, you
will find a way to implement your views. Circuit courts are often
the courts of last resort.'' He said there would be a ``great
risk'' if the Senate confirmed Siegan.
   Responding to Leahy, Siegan said, ``A circuit court judge is
given scholarly duties to see if what the lower court did was
right. I have spent 20 years of my life in scholarly activities.
Even a lawyer with trial experience may not know how to write an
opinion.''
   Among Siegan's controversial writings:
   He would have outlawed separate but equal schools as the Supreme
Court did in 1954, but would have used a reasoning far afield from
that used by the high court in reaching its decision.
   According to Siegan, the court should have based its decision on
the right of black students to travel to the school of their
choice. Civil rights advocates have said travel to a new school
would not guarantee pupils a seat inside.
   Siegan wrote that the 14th Amendment ``safeguards only
fundamental and natural rights from violation by the states. There
is no fundamental or natural right to education, nor to an
integrated education. Each is a political right created by
government and is accordingly not within the guarantees of the 14th
Amendment.''
   He wrote that the amendment, which extended federal
constitutional safeguards to residents of the individual states,
was meant to safeguard religious liberty _ but not separation of
church and state.
   It is that view which led him to say it is ``possible to argue
that prayer in school would not be in violation of the
Constitution.'' The Supreme Court has taken the opposite view.

<HEAD>Woman Accused of Killing Husband Relinquishes Right to Bury Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman accused of murdering her
husband has given up her fight with his family over his burial, but
she will be allowed to arrange a memorial service for him,
attorneys said.
   Denise Monique Horner, 21, is charged with first-degree murder
in the contract shooting of her husband, Vincent Horner, 25, whose
body was found Feb. 2 in his pickup truck in a mall parking lot.
   Mrs. Horner, who is being held without bond at the Duval County
Jail, had arranged for her husband's body to be buried or cremated
by a Jacksonville funeral home.
   But the victim's father, Burt Horner, filed a lawsuit saying
that because Mrs. Horner is accused of killing her husband, she has
lost her right to decide how the body should be disposed. He wanted
to take his son's body to his home state of Louisiana.
   Under Florida law, a dead person's spouse has the right to
dispose of the body unless the spouse caused the death.
   Circuit Judge Charles O. Mitchell ruled that since Mrs. Horner
has not yet been convicted of the crime, Burt Horner would have to
prove during a civil trial that Mrs. Horner caused her husband's
death.
   Wednesday, however, attorneys for both sides reached a
settlement in which Burt Horner would get custody of the body. He
agreed, however, to keep his son's body in Jacksonville for 10 days
so Mrs. Horner and her family could hold a memorial service.
   Alan Chipperfield, Mrs. Horner's attorney, said Wednesday he
hopes to get a judicial order allowing Mrs. Horner to attend the
service in the custody of an officer.
   Prosecutors have said they plan to seek the death penalty
against Mrs. Horner. According to court documents, witnesses told
police Mrs. Horner told them she had arranged to have her husband
killed.
   There have been no other arrests in Horner's death.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of House members on Thursday condemned
South Africa's decision to ban activities of anti-apartheid groups
and scheduled a stepped-up timetable for action on legislation to
impose stricter sanctions on the Pretoria regime.
   Several of the members also had strong criticism for President
Reagan, who in a Wednesday night news conference said South African
unrest results from ``a tribal policy more than it is a racial
policy.''
   Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Africa subcommittee, scheduled five days of hearings next
month and said he hoped to bring a strong sanctions bill to the
floor by mid-April or earlier.
   ``Additional sanctions are the only peaceful means for the West
to hammer home to Pretoria that the West will not permit the voices
of opposition to expire,'' Wolpe said at a news conference.
   He called the white minority government's decision to outlaw
even peaceful dissent ``yet one more step towards absolute
totalitarian government control over South Africa's non-white
majority. The South African regime leaves no doubt of its
determination to systematically deny any and all forms of
legitimate protest, to criminalize what we in the United States
know are basic human rights.''
   Wolpe noted that South African Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu
had appealed to Western nations to step up anti-apartheid sanctions
in response to the latest crackdown, and said his committee would
begin working on a tough sanctions package sponsored by Rep. Ron
Dellums, D-Calif.
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, criticized Reagan's news-conference
comment as ``very insensitive and lacking any sense of history.
This is an issue of democracy. This administration has to stand up
on this issue. It can't just slough it off.''
   Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., said of Reagan: ``His idea of South
Africa is that of a 1930s Tarzan movie.''
   Wolpe noted that the State Department had protested the latest
crackdown on dissent by anti-apartheid groups. But he added, ``the
moment has arrived for the Reagan administration to back its words
with action.''

<TEXT>
   A cut in a major telephone cable 15
miles south of Newark disrupted communications along the East Coast
on Thursday, according to American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
officials.
   Bill Leach, a manager in the AT&T network operations center,
said the break occurred at about 9:40 a.m. and resulted in a
``fairly heavy network blockage'' of both voice and data
transmissions.
   About 20 percent to 25 percent of the calls running north and
south between Boston and Washington were answered with a recording
that told callers that all circuits were busy, and asked them to
try again later.
   A re-routing scheme whittled down the interrupted calls, and by
noon all calls were going through, Leach said.
   Private circuits, most of them devoted to data transmission,
would take longer to restore, Leach said. Loops were being arranged
to divert those circuits, he said, and work was underway to repair
the cable.
   Leach said the cause of the break was unknown.
   The cut disrupted Associated Press services, interrupting
dispatches from AP bureaus to the cooperative's headquarters in New
York as well as news to newspapers and broadcast outlets nationwide.
   Efforts to restore service using backup circuits were held up by
the severity of the problem, but ultimately service was restored.

<HEAD>Shipments of Federally Inspected Reindeer Steaks Would Be Allowed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shipments of federally inspected reindeer
steaks across the country would be allowed under a proposal
announced Thursday by the Agriculture Department.
   There is mandatory federal inspection of cattle, hogs, chickens
and turkeys at slaughter plants, which allows those carcasses to be
shipped across state lines.
   In addition, regulations permit the voluntary inspection of
certain exotic animals slaughtered for human food. Those include
the American bison, or buffalo, and the cattalo, a cross between
cattle and the buffalo.
   Lester M. Crawford, head of the department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service, said producers of exotic animals have asked
that the inspection list be expanded to include reindeer, elk,
deer, antelope and water buffalo.
   ``This proposal is a response to their request and could
facilitate the sale and export of the carcasses, meat and meat food
products from these animals,'' he said. ``Once the animals and
products are inspected and passed, they can be sold interstate or
exported.''
   Producers of the animals would pay fees to receive the optional
inspection service. Crawford said fewer than 2,000 exotic animals
are slaughtered annually at the present time and that the slaughter
level is not expected to increase much if the exotic list is
expanded.
   By comparison, he said, annual cattle slaughter has been running
at more than 32 million head.
   Public comments on the proposal can be sent by April 26 to:
Linda Carey, FSIS Hearing Clerk, Room 3168-S, FSIS, USDA,
Washington, D.C. 20250.

<HEAD>FEC Approves Cost-Reporting Split For Candidates' Ads</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Election Commission on Thursday
sanctioned excluding some TV costs from the state spending limits
for presidential campaigns, in what a dissenting member said was
``blowing the state limits out of the water.''
   By 4-2, the FEC told Democratic contender Albert Gore Jr. that
it is all right to count half of a television ad as a fund-raising
expense _ which is exempt from the spending limits _ even if the
overt money solicitation occurs during three seconds of a 60-second
ad.
   Commissioner Joan Aikens objected, saying it is merely
``sanctioning creative accounting to get around the limits.''
   ``I think we are absolutely blowing the state limits out of the
water,'' she said.
   Gore, a senator from Tennessee, sought the opinion after Rep.
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis,
who are among Gore's rivals for the Democratic presidential
nomination, ran ads in Iowa and counted up to half the cost as a
fund-raising expense. That allowed them to spend more money against
the Iowa overall limit of $775,000.
   Because of the need to have a good showing in Iowa, scene of the
first Democratic caucuses, candidates try to spend as much as
possible there. Most of the Democratic candidates spent the limit.
   Bob Bauer, Gephardt's campaign attorney, expressed satisfaction
with the FEC decision and discounted as nonsense the allegations
that the practice was merely a way to overspend.
   ``We didn't write the law. We simply read the law ... and
interpreted it as the FEC has interpreted it,'' he said.
   Gore's spokesman Paul Risley said the campaign was glad the FEC
had clarified the issue, but declined to elaborate.
   The commission majority said the agency's auditors should not
have to scrutinize every campaign commercial to decide what portion
should be considered fund raising.
   In arguing the prevailing viewpoint, Chairman Thomas Josefiak
said that even if an ad also has other purposes, as long as it
contains some obvious fund-raising message and information on how
to contribute _ such as a telephone number to call _ the ad can be
seen as having a dual purpose. In that case, a 50 percent
allocation for fund-raising would be reasonable, the commission
determined.
   The decision rejected the recommendation of the FEC legal staff
which had held that the write-off should be generally proportional
to the part of the ad that contains a fund-raising message.
   In the case of the 60-second ad proposed by Gore, with an appeal
for viewers to contribute in the last three seconds, a 5 percent
allocation for fund raising would be reasonable, but 50 percent
would not, FEC counsel Larry Noble contended.
   Commissioner Lee Ann Elliott, who dissented along with Aikens,
suggested a flat 10-percent write-off for fund raising should be
imposed for ads. She criticized the majority decision as a
``mushy'' one that does not give the campaigns a precise guideline.
   The law sets a spending cap for each state and an overall
campaign spending limit of $23 million, plus another $4.6 million
for fund-raising costs. The fund-raising costs can be excluded from
state limits as long as the campaign has not gone over the $4.6
million.
   The FEC for several years has asked Congress to do away with
state-by-state limits as burdensome.
   Gore did not mention the other campaigns in his request, but his
aides said the query was an attempt to get an FEC ruling on the
activity of his opponents.
   Gore's hypothetical case, involving an ad he proposed for
Colorado's April 4 caucuses, paralleled Gephardt's commercial in
Iowa in which the final seconds asked viewers to ``vote, volunteer,
contribute.'' Gephardt excluded half the cost from the spending his
campaign allocated to Iowa.
   The Gephardt and Dukakis campaigns had cited the precedent of
Ohio Democratic Sen. John Glenn's presidential campaign in 1984, in
which the FEC allowed a 50 percent fund-raising write-off for
Glenn's half-hour TV show.
   But commissioners said that example should not be a guideline,
because the FEC decided the matter well after the election during a
routine FEC audit of Glenn's finances to determine if any of his
federal matching funds were improperly spent or if there had been
any irregularities.
   That decision was in the context of negotiation and compromise,
Josefiak noted, after the Glenn campaign had initially tried to
count the entire 30-minute show as a fund-raising expense.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary William J. Bennett gave
the states mediocre grades Thursday on an annual report card that
showed dropout rates up slightly, college entrance test scores
level and spending higher than ever.
   ``The news is not what it should be. Test scores are in a dead
stall,'' Bennett said as he unveiled two wall charts crammed with
statistics ranking the states on tests, graduation rates, teacher
pay and other measures.
   ``In saying that I am disappointed, I think I speak for the
American people,'' Bennett told reporters. ``We're paying top
dollar to educate our children, but we're sure not getting top
return.''
   Mary Hatwood Futrell, president of the National Education
Association, the nation's largest teachers union, said in an
interview:
   ``The time has come to halt the wall chart charade and for
people to sit down and really talk about ways we can improve the
quality of education for all young people in this country.''
   ``The chart really doesn't give us a lot of helpful information
... other than to serve as a reminder of what we said a long time
ago: if you don't provide the support and the resources, and you
raise standards, children are going to fall through the cracks,''
Mrs. Futrell said.
   Asked if citizens should use the statistics as ammunition to
vote down school levies, Bennett said that depends on how well the
local schools are performing.
   Referring to Chicago's troubled schools, which he said recently
are in ``an educational meltdown,'' Bennett said:
   ``If I were a citizen of Chicago and they said, `We need more
money to make this school effective,' I'd tell them to take a hike.
... They're spending $6,000 per kid for a 50 percent dropout
(rate).''
   Nationally, Bennett said the graduation rate from public high
schools in 1986 was only 71.5 percent, down from 71.7 percent in
1985.
   The graduation rate is up from 69.5 percent in 1982, but it is
far short of President Reagan's goal of a 90 percent graduation
rate by 1990.
   Only Minnesota, with a 91.4 percent graduation rate, has
bettered that goal. Near it are Connecticut, 89.8 percent; North
Dakota, 89.7 percent; Nebraska, 88.1 percent; and Iowa, 87.5
percent.
   The worst graduation rates are the District of Columbia, 56.8
percent; Florida, 62.0 percent; Georgia and Louisiana, both 62.7
percent; and Arizona, 63.0 percent.
   It was the fifth straight year that an education secretary has
released the controversial all charts. Bennett's predecessor, T.H.
Bell, initiated the practice.
   The Class of 1987's scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test and
American College Testing program were released last fall. The
national average on the SAT, scored on a scale of 400 to 1,600, was
906. The average on the ACT, which has a scale of 1 to 36, was 18.7.
   Bennett provided his own rankings of the states.
   He singled out South Carolina for praise, although its SAT
average of 832 was again dead last among the 22 states where the
SAT is the dominant test. He said South Carolina has picked up 17
points in the past two years, and he called it a pacesetter in
efforts to hold educators more accountable for student performance.
   Bennett also praised California for a tough new social studies
curriculum; Virginia for efforts to make high school students take
rigorous math courses; and New Jersey for welcoming non-education
majors into the teaching profession.
   The secretary said 43 states now require entering teachers to
pass competency tests, up from 34 last year. They are not required
by the District of Columbia, Alaska, Iowa, North Dakota, Utah,
Vermont, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
   Gordon Ambach, executive director of the Council of Chief State
School Officers, said the graduation rate exceeds 75 percent if
high school equivalency diplomas are counted, but he agreed that is
not good enough. He cautioned against reading too much into
Bennett's scorecard.
   The wall chart listed seven states _ Arkansas, Georgia,
Kentucky, New Jersey, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas _ with laws
allowing state intervention in ``academically bankrupt'' school
districts.
   Bennett said nearly 10 percent of high school graduates now take
advanced college placement exams, up from less than 5 percent in
1982, and a larger proportion of seniors are taking the ACT and
SAT. That ``means we are succeeding in keeping scores level despite
a larger pool of test-takers,'' he said.
   Test results ``show that poor, black and Hispanic children are
performing better,'' said Bennett, although there is still a wide
gap between minority and majority scores.
   Bennett said that since 1976 black students' scores on the SAT
have risen by 42 points to 728, while white students' scores fell
eight points to 936.
   He was asked if it troubled him that SAT scores rose during the
early 1980s, but have stayed flat since he joined the Cabinet.
   ``I don't take that personally.'' he replied. ``I don't think
the children taking these tests are in any particular conspiracy
against me. It's more a comment on what was going on in their
classroom.''

<TEXT>
   Movie and television writers are conducting
whisper-quiet negotiations with producers for a new three-year
contract, an uncharacteristic approach for the film capital's most
militant union.
   Three years ago, the 9,000-member Writers Guild of America
shuddered under internal strife. One faction contended union
leaders had misinformed the membership about the producers' offer
and caused an unnecessary two-week strike.
   The union eventually voted to accept virtually the same contract
it had rejected. An organizational shakeup followed.
   Talks for the 1988 contract with the Alliance of Motion Picture
and Television Producers are nearing an end, with writers seeking a
greater share of foreign market income and producers hoping to
restructure residual payments for one-hour syndicated shows.
   The alliance is an umbrella organization representing about 200
studios and producers. The contract with writers expires at
midnight Feb. 29, when the producers say they will make their final
offer.
   The union and producers have been discussing their disagreements
behind closed doors, and carefully handling their public statements
with low-key information campaigns.
   Producers say that despite record box office grosses, the
entertainment industry needs a serious cost-control campaign.
   The union seeks what it calls ``parallel growth,'' meaning more
money from areas in which the producers are doing well.
   Guild West Regional Director Brian Walton said the union is
prepared to strike if necessary, ``but we would first hope to work
out the problems.''
   Herb Steinberg, a spokesman for the alliance, has characterized
chief producer negotiator Nicholas Counter and Walton as ``very
intelligent, bright gentlemen ... there is no sense of rancor or
confrontation.''
   Steinberg said the producers' offer on Feb. 29 will be ``firm
and final.'' Walton said the union has taken precautions to make
sure members are kept informed about negotiations, to avoid the
confusion and rancor of 1985.
   Since its first contract in 1947, the union has hit the bricks
in 1959, 1960, 1973, 1981 and 1985 _ the most strikes by any
Hollywood union.
   Its West Coast members, numbering about 6,500, will vote on the
producers' offer on March 1, while 2,000 of the 2,500 East Coast
members will consider the contract on March. 2. The other 500
members on the East Coast are television newswriters unaffected by
this contract.
   In 1987, union members enjoyed an 11.6 percent increase in
residual payments, to $57 million, with $39.5 million of that from
television. Currently, a writer receives $5,100 for a half-hour
television script, but experienced writers generally negotiate a
substantially higher fee.
   Motion pictures drew a record $4.25 billion in ticket sales for
1987. But producers insist development and production costs are
still overwhelming.
   Steinberg and Walton both refused to characterize any issue as
dominant. But the writers' proposal to increase their residual
share of lucrative foreign market distribution income, and the
producer's desire to cut residual costs for one-hour syndicated
television shows, appear to be the most controversial.
   Writers argue that theatrical and broadcasting product has
become one of the largest U.S. exports, registering at least a $4.9
billion trade surplus in 1986. Producers say looking at individual
growth areas without paying attention to rising production costs is
unrealistic.
   Producers have asked writers to drop the fixed residual rate for
hourlong television shows and accept a sliding scale of residual
payments tied to the show's syndication licensing success.
   Few shows these days turn a first-run profit. The deficit for a
one-hour show in 1986-1987 was $370,274, producers have said.
   While shows for prime-time television have long been
deficit-financed, producers used to make their money back with
lucrative syndication deals for reruns. But new
made-for-syndication shows have hurt that market.
   ``The one-hour show syndication market has dried up,'' alliance
spokesman Steinberg said. ``Some deals are possible, if we could
bring the price down.''
   Walton has said the producers' proposal is not in parity with
the deal movie and television directors got last summer for
accepting the same formula.
   The union said its analysis showed the producers' figures are
derived from the 15 most expensive action-adventure shows. ``Also,
they are still producing and developing these hourlong shows,''
Walton said.
   Producers also want to raise the minimum for defined ``low
budget'' movies and television shows. Writers take a substantial
cut in fees for a defined ``low budget'' work.
   Writers once again are seeking residual increases for
videocassette movies, noting directors received an increase in
their 1987 contract.
   Among the other 107 demands from the guild are increased
affirmative action hiring for women and minority writers; increased
health fund contributions by management; and creative rights for
scriptwriters.

<HEAD>Private Group Offers Low-Interest Loans To Colleges, Universities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A non-profit group on Thursday announced a new
loan service that will allow colleges and universities to borrow up
to $100 million at below prime interest rates.
   The Capital Access Trust will make loans to institutions with
good credit for new buildings, renovations or for operating money.
   It is the latest undertaking of University Support Services
Inc., a non-profit corporation started in 1986 by business and
academic leaders to lend money to students from families that do
not qualify for financial aid.
   The Rev. John P. Whalen, president of University Support
Services and former president of the Catholic University of
America, said more than three-quarters of the nation's campuses
will need to undertake renovations or new construction in the next
five years costing millions of dollars.
   He said the trust is ``a major new source of capital ... in
amounts ranging anywhere from relatively small loans to upwards of
$100 million.''
   He claimed it will be able to make the loan commitments in just
45 days at rates more favorable ``than any source of borrowing we
know, except tax-exempt financing.''
   The trust is funded by the sale of University Support Services
commercial paper notes, backed by a bank line of credit and
underwritten by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The interest rate is tied to the commercial paper note rate
quoted in the Wall Street Journal, which Whalen said is
significantly lower than the prime rate.
   Whalen said that if a college borrows $50 million from the trust
for three years instead of borrowing from a bank at the prime rate,
it could save $250,000 to $350,000 in interest.
   University Support Services' student loan program, called
ConSern, lends individuals from $1,500 to $25,000 a year for
private school or college costs. The interest rate varies; it is
currently 10.44 percent.

   A man and woman were charged Thursday
with trying to sell their 3-month-old baby girl after they
allegedly offered to trade the child for a car to drive to Mexico,
authorities said.
   A car lot worker told police that the woman said she and the man
wanted to trade the baby for an ``old junker'' to go to Mexico
because they could not afford to keep the baby.
   Detective Kevin Foster said Alicia Rodriguez, 31, and Porfirio
Noriega, 23, both of Fort Worth, were charged with the sale or
purchase of a child. They were held in the Tarrant County Jail in
lieu of $1,000 bond.
   A man and woman at the car dealership refused to make a trade
for the child, Foster said, but did offer to adopt the baby and
sell the couple a car on credit.
   The child is in the care of the Department of Human Services,
Foster said.

   Rising floodwaters forced the
evacuation of more than 10,000 people and have inundated 1,500
houses this week in the central part of the country, officials said
Thursday.
   At least 16 deaths have been reported since Monday in floods
along the Orange River in the Orange Free State and have since
spread to the northern Cape province.
   Rail traffic has been knocked out and the main highway between
Johannesburg and Cape Town is reduced to one lane. Twenty-five
magisterial districts have been declared disaster areas and farmers
are harvesting their crops 24 hours a day to save something from
the encroaching rivers.
   The strongly flowing Orange River, fed by the Vaal and Modder
rivers, has risen more than 6{ feet in two days, the South African
Press Association reported.
   Half of the town of Douglas, 50 miles west of the historic
mining town of Kimberley, was underwater Thursday and hundreds of
residents had been evacuated to a nearby hill, SAPA reported. In
the towns of Prieska and Upington, another 200 miles west along the
Orange River, residents began loading furniture into trucks in
preparation for the wall of water expected to hit them by Saturday.
   Local police said the flood line is already higher than the
level reached in 1974, when the Orange River rose more than 32{
feet, destroying 70 percent of the crops in the central part of the
country and leaving hundreds homeless.
   The Minister of National Health, Willie van Niekerk, estimated
damage to the road and rail network at about $10 million, and
damage to bridges at $3 million. Crop and housing damage could not
be estimated until the waters subside.
   Clean water is still scarce, telephone lines are down, and mail
is being delivered by boat in areas of the Orange Free State.
   Flooded roads, washed-out homes and inundated cropland have also
been reported in Lesotho, Swaziland and Mozambique, but no deaths
have been reported.

<HEAD>Drug Agents Predict Street Wars over Growing Traffic in Asian
Heroin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUE MANNING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two recently slain drug agents may have been
victims of a war pitting old-line dealers and government agents
against Asian gangs who are importing ``Golden Triangle'' heroin
into California, officials said Thursday.
   Emerging Thai, Cambodian and Laotian drug rings will likely
clash with existing Hispanic, black and white gangs, opening the
way for street wars like those in Miami in the 1970s and '80s, said
John Hensley, the top drug enforcement officer for the U.S. Customs
Service on the West Coast.
   ``If the Asians start mixing it up with the Mexican and black
gangs, we may see the gun battles and murders that marked the old
Colombian `cocaine cowboy' wars in Miami a decade ago,'' Hensley
said. ``With the kind of money involved, either side could do the
shooting.''
   Two Drug Enforcement Administration working undercover to crack
an alleged Taiwanese heroin ring were gunned down in Pasadena
earlier this month. Two alleged traffickers also were killed.
   Investigators have said the alleged drug dealers were unaware
they were dealing with federal agents and had set up a drug
purchase with plans all along to rob and kill their ``customers.''
   Such violent confrontations are typical of the turf wars waged
by smugglers and sellers, Hensley said.
   In Miami during the late 1970s and early 1980s, ``I was there
during one turf battle between Colombians and Cubans and we
(federal agents) were the only ones without automatic weapons,'' he
said.
   ``We saw the turf wars there. If we don't get a cap on it now,
it will become a reality here and we don't want it to be a
reality,'' he said.
   The amount of Golden Triangle heroin, named for the fertile
opium-growing area where Thailand, Cambodia and Laos meet, arriving
in California during the last two years has increased dramatically.
Three years ago, only about 15 percent of the heroin smuggled into
the state was of the Asian variety, said DEA spokesman Roger
Guevara.
   ``We now estimate that Southeast Asian heroin represents 50
percent to 80 percent of all the heroin coming into the country.
It's a huge influx for Los Angeles, and it has turned Los Angeles
into a major transshipment center for New York,'' he said.
   ``The Asians, including the Taiwanese, have a ready supply and
the potential growth of Asian gangs in heroin distribution can lead
to more violence,'' Guevara said. ``On the other hand, the blacks,
Mexicans and the whites have always controlled the street heroin
market.''
   It will cost some more lives to stop the war, the men agreed.
Agents dealing with drugs and gangs are always more at risk than
other agents, Hensley said.
   ``They aren't wearing body armor. Undercover you never know when
you're being burned and the backup isn't always that great,'' he
said.
   Heroin is more appealing to dealers than other drugs for several
reasons, Hensley said.
   Because of several national programs, including big anti-drug
pushes by the sports and entertainment industries and anti-drug
messages by stars, use of cocaine and marijuana has stabilized, he
said.
   ``Heroin is different. Users don't look at Michael Jackson as a
role model. The heroin user group is growing slightly, even though
there is a turnover because as new users come in, others overdose
and die out.''
   And heroin brings a distributor a much higher price than a like
amount of cocaine, Hensley added, in part because it ultimately can
be diluted to as low as 3 percent for street sales.
   A pound of heroin sells for about $50,000, and a kilo, 2.2
pounds, for between $90,000 and $200,000, ``depending on the purity
and the dealer,'' he said.
   Agents used to concentrate on couriers who brought in a few
pounds of heroin on ships or international flights, he said.
   But now, heroin has started arriving in the mail, Hensley said.
``About two weeks ago, we seized about 45 pounds at the mail
facility in Oakland.''
   ``We have to look everywhere now,'' he said.

<HEAD>EPA Unveils Policy To Involve States In Deciding On Pesticide Use</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency on
Thursday unveiled a draft policy that could let states decide when,
where and how to use pesticides which could contaminate groundwater.
   States would get such powers by adopting pesticide management
programs approved by EPA. Otherwise, EPA would forbid use of the
pesticide in states or counties with high potential for groundwater
contamination.
   Without a state plan, ``the risk-benefit determinations
underlying these EPA-determined geographic prohibitions will be
rather crude,'' the agency said.
   With a plan, states could employ more detailed land and water
data than EPA would have available. ``Where found appropriate, EPA
would consider modifying the federal registration to accomodate the
state program,'' the agency said.
   EPA published the policy as a draft, asking for comment from the
public over the next four months.
   A single national approach ``is going to over-protect, or
possibly under-protect'' in specific areas, said John A. Moore,
assistant administrator for pesticides and toxic substances, at a
news conference.
   Soils and groundwater vulnerability vary greatly even within
counties, and at the county level and below ``EPA's ability to do
something ... is not very good,'' Moore said.
   But that does not mean ``EPA would walk away from these
pesticides.'' In deciding whether to license a chemical, or
re-license it, EPA has been considering groundwater in deciding
whether to impose national conditions, he said.
   Also, the contamination standards the states would be obliged to
observe would be set by EPA _ existing drinking water standards for
chemicals that don't cause cancer, and for cancer-causing
chemicals, a concentration that would yield a one in a million
chance of cancer for someone drinking from the aquifer over a
lifetime.
   Pesticide contamination of groundwater is a relatively new
issue. The first examples were found in New York and California in
1979.
   EPA expects to complete a survey in 1990 on the extent of
contamination. Two years ago, the agency said 19 pesticides had
been found in groundwater in 24 states. Now, said Patrick Holden,
team leader of the groundwater project in EPA's pesticides office,
50 to 60 different chemicals have been found in wells in 30 states.
Iowa has found pesticides in half the wells serving cities.
   Pesticides are not the only thing that contaminates groundwater,
source of drinking water for half the population and for 97 percent
of people living in rural areas. Fertilizers, waste disposal wells
and leaking underground tanks all can contribute substantially.
   States may get federal aid for setting up wellhead protection
zones, and soon EPA expects to adopt a groundwater strategy that
would require states to classify aquifers under a three-part scheme
for high priority protection, drinking water sources and water
unlikely ever to be drunk and thus needing little protection.
   This strategy has been opposed by many environmentalists as
writing off what could a substantial fraction of groundwater
supplies.
   Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., said Thursday in introducing a
bill calling for minimum federal standards for all aquifers, ``I
cannot agree with it.''
   ``We have no right to come in on this slice of the world or life
in 1988 and say we are just going to abandon these resources,'' the
senator told a news conference about his bill, at least the 10th
dealing with groundwater this session.
   The senator said he would have to study EPA's Thursday proposal
for the states, though his bill would permit states to go beyond
federal standards.

   Democratic presidential candidate
Michael Dukakis called rival Richard Gephardt a ``flip-flopper'' as
tensions ran high between the two at a long-term health care forum
on Thursday.
   Dukakis warned Gephardt against turning the campaign negative,
but Gephardt said he thought it was important to highlight
differences on issues and experience.
   Dukakis and Gephardt are struggling for stature as the calendar
winds down toward the Super Tuesday round of primaries and caucuses
in the South. Each has won two contests to date.
   Earlier in the day, Dukakis said he learned a painful lesson
about negative campaigning when he lost a 1978 re-election bid as
Massachusetts governor and ``it's not going to happen again.''
   He went on to say in Boca Raton, ``I don't think this `prince of
darkness' routine is going to sell'' and that he would not stand
for Gephardt attacks.
   In the hour-long health care session here, Dukakis and Gephardt
largely agreed on the need for a national long-term health care
program. But Dukakis bristled when a question suggested he was
flip-flopping on the role of private insurance for long-term care.
   ``This is the flip-flopper over here; I'm not the
flip-flopper,'' Dukakis said, looking at the Missouri congressman,
whose record has been criticized by other candidates as
inconsistent.
   Both strongly supported the proposal by Rep. Claude Pepper, the
87-year-old Miami Democrat, to guarantee home health care for the
elderly and chronically ill. Pepper's bill didn't come to a vote
last year as some congressional Democrats worried about a potential
cost in the tens of billions of dollars.
   Pepper's plan would lift the 45 percent cap on income subject to
Medicare payroll tax, and both candidates agreed that extra revenue
should be able to get the program started.
   ``It's the old-fashioned American way of taxing on the ability
to pay, which is what we ought to do,'' Dukakis said.
   ``We're not doing it right today,'' Gephardt said of
government-provided health care. ``It doesn't have to cost a lot
more money.''
   Dukakis said health care presents a fundamental difference
between the Democratic and Republican parties and he called health
care an American birthright.
   ``If you lose your health, nothing else matters,'' Gephardt said
to loud applause from the audience at a retirement community.
   Dukakis said he dominated Gephardt in working-class areas of New
Hampshire and Minnesota, both contests the Massachusetts governor
won, then warned that a negative campaign would hurt the Democrats
and also that Gephardt's record was vulnerable.
   ``People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones,'' Dukakis said
after the senior forum here. He said Gephardt shouldn't attack the
establishment and then accept corporate political action committee
funds.
   ``Something could be said for consistency,'' Dukakis said.
   Gephardt denied his campaign was negative.
   ``I am trying in this campaign and will continue to try to
outline what I think are the differences,'' Gephardt said. ``Let's
have a discussion of the issues.''
   Dukakis scoffed when told Gephardt said he wasn't being negative.
   ``Everybody knows what he's doing. When you're behind you
attack,'' Dukakis said.
   On Wednesday, Gephardt gave a speech in Waco, Texas, that
harshly criticized Dukakis. ``The candidate with the most money has
the least message,'' Gephardt said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonald's has decided the British spud is a dud
when it comes to French fries, and its plan to switch to American
potato varieties has created a flap among some patriots.
   The fast-food chain plans to use British-grown potatoes of the
North American variety called the Russet Burbank. For years, it has
used British-grown potatoes of the British Pentland Dell variety.
   A company spokeswoman said Thursday the decision to make the
change in the British McDonald's outlets was made ``basically
because the Russet Burbank has got a better flavor and texture.''
   ``It is a more suitable potato for our requirements,'' she said,
speaking on condition of anonymity in accordance with British
custom.
   She said British farmers have been contracted to grow the
American variety.
   McDonald's is a big customer of the British potato farmer. It
needs 55,000 tons of potatoes a year to keep its 263 British
outlets in the chips, as the French fry is called here.
   The American variety produces French fries that hang
tantalizingly over the edge of their packets without breaking in
the middle, farmers told the Today newspaper.
   But agricultural expert Michael Shaw, who isn't happy about the
switch, told the newspaper, ``McDonald's is so powerful in the
fast-food business that they are killing off the great British
chip.''
   Conservative lawmaker Ann Winterton agreed.
   ``My primary interest is promoting food which is grown in this
country. Potatoes is a crop we grow particularly well. There are
many varieties of excellent qualities.''
   She said it would suprise her if the American variety was better.
   Another Tory member of Parliament, Jerry Wiggin, chairman of the
House of Commons select committee on agriculture, said: ``Judging
from the fantastic support from my own children, McDonald's doesn't
appear to be doing badly using British potatoes.''
   McDonald's conducted tests with the Russet Burbank on farms
throughout the country during the past eight years, according to
the Daily Telegraph.
   This year, production of the Russet Burbank, which was developed
in California 112 years ago, is in full swing on about 4,000 acres,
the Daily Telegraph said.
   Britain's Potato Marketing Board is not opposed to the switch.
   ``The amount of potatoes being taken up on the processing side
is increasing and obviously, if growers want to take advantage of
it, obviously they have to grow what the buyers want,'' said a
board spokeswoman, who didn't want to be identified further.
   ``There is not going to be an en masse switch to Russet Burbank
with everyone growing nothing but that,'' the spokeswoman said.
   McDonald's main rivals say they are sticking with their British
spuds.
   John Shedden, a spokesman for Burger King, said the British
variety meets all of Burger King's requirements. Burger King has 18
outlets in Britain.
   Wimpy, a British fast-food chain, operates 400 restaurants that
fry about 8,580 tons of potatoes a year. It uses the British
Pentland Dell variety, as well as another British variety called
the Maris Piper and a Dutch variety called Bintje.
   A Wimpy spokeswoman said the type of potato used has less to do
with the chips' flavor than the fat or oil used to fry it.
   Wimpy says its uses vegetable oil. McDonald's says it uses a
combination of cottonseed oil and beef tallow. Burger King won't
say.

<HEAD>Solidarity Says Authorities Blocking Walesa Trip To Australia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polish authorities are blocking Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa and three top aides from traveling to Australia
to attend an international trade union congress, a spokesman for
the banned union said Wednesday.
   ``The authorities are trying to block the procedure at every
possible stage,'' said Solidarity's national spokesman Janusz
Onyszkiewicz, in a telephone interview. ``They are trying to play
formal, bureaucratic tricks ... Without actually refusing to grant
them passports.''
   Walesa and three other Solidarity leaders are trying to obtain
passports to allow them to travel to Australia to attend the March
14-18 World Congress of the International Confederation of Free
Trade Unions in Melbourne.
   They were invited by the Australian Confederation of Trade
Unions.
   ``Lech wants to do everything possible to go there, as this is a
congress of a trade union organization of which Solidarity is a
member,'' said Bogdan Olszewski, a Walesa aide, contacted at the
union leader's Gdansk apartment.
   Walesa has not left Poland since the December 1981 imposition of
martial law that suppressed Solidarity.
   Walesa applied 10 days ago for vacation leave from his job as an
electrician at Gdansk's Lenin Shipyard, but so far he has not
received any response from shipyard authorities, Olszewski said.
   Poles must have the approval of their workplace in order to file
an application for a passport, which then can take two to four
weeks to be processed.
   Walesa expected the shipyard would delay its decision until it
was too late for him to make the trip, Olszewski said. Walesa once
earlier tried to obtain a passport to travel to Italy, but was
refused leave from the shipyard.
   Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, the Wroclaw Solidarity leader, said the
local passport office refused to accept his passport application on
Thursday, claiming his invitation was invalid because it was not
issued by a private individual but an institution.
   Bogdan Lis, the Gdansk Solidarity leader, said he would try to
apply for his passport Friday, while union adviser Bronislaw
Geremek of Warsaw has filed his passport application and is waiting
for a decision.
   Polish government spokesman Jerzy Urban told a news conference
Tuesday that if Walesa is granted a leave from work his request for
a passport ''will be examined in accordance with the existing
regulations, as is the case with every other Polish citizen.

   A secret presidential study harshly criticizes
State Department officials, the American ambassador and Marines for
neglecting security at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow where a
sex-for-secrets scandal erupted last year.
   ``A fundamental reorientation of the way we do business in the
Soviet Union is critical,'' according to the report by a
blue-ribbon panel that President Reagan appointed last spring.
   The report scores the ambassador for his ``aloof'' management
style, calls working conditions at the embassy a ``national
disgrace,'' and says Marine guards ``tolerated'' and then ``covered
up'' incidents of misconduct, including sexual activities,
drunkenness, brawling and currency manipulation.
   ``Many share responsibility for the security vulnerabilities
that existed and in some cases still exist,'' said the panel,
headed by former Defense Secretary Melvin R. Laird.
   The so-called Laird report was submitted to the State
Department, which has refused to release it. Charles Redman, a
department spokesman, said the report has not been made public
because it is a confidential document for Secretary of State George
P. Shultz.
   Laird urged release of an unclassified version of the document,
but said he could not talk about its substance unless the
department unseals it. There is also a classified version of the
report containing more sensitive information.
   The Associated Press was shown a copy of the report, the result
of the panel's work from May 7 until July 17.
   Since the panel finished work, one Marine has been convicted of
spying. But some of the more sensational allegations _ such as
reports that KGB agents were allowed to prowl the embassy's
top-secret areas _ have been discounted.
   The report said what happened at the embassy ``may never be
known,'' and it added: ``Our investigation has revealed that a
situation existed ... that would have permitted the incidents to
have occurred as alleged...''
   Robert E. Lamb, assistant secretary of state for diplomatic
security, said gaps existed in the embassy's security program in
the past. ``There were some holes and we have moved to fill them,''
he said.
   Efforts have been made to upgrade security and add more
personnel to the counterintelligence staff, he said.
   Some of the findings in the Laird report are new; others repeat
concerns raised previously about the embassy. Here is a sampling:
   _Laird called the embassy a ``pigsty,'' and the report said it
was a fire trap. Last week, fire broke out in a section of the
embassy.
   Corridors were cluttered with papers, books and personal
effects; stairwells and hallways were ``strewn with broken
equipment and machinery parts awaiting repair and disposal,'' the
report said.
   ``Those assigned to Moscow find themselves working in a seedy,
disgraceful facility with inadequate support from Washington,'' the
report said.
   _It is ``possible that some Marines who had discipline problems
elsewhere were assigned to Moscow as punishment,'' and the
situation was ripe for exploitation by the KGB, the Soviet spy
agency.
   _The panel reserved ``special criticism'' for the Marines in the
guard detachment as ``their misconduct and failure to perform their
duties in a prescribed manner led to increased vulnerability in the
mission's security,'' the report said. Some embassy staffers also
violated regulations.
   _Confusion marked policies barring Marines from fraternizing
with Soviets and reporting their contacts. The policies ``obviously
were not taken seriously enough to provide security,'' the report
said.
   _The State Department's counterintelligence staff was so
overworked _ only 11 of the 27 authorized positions were filled _
that ``only the most rudimentary investigation was conducted on the
most pressing cases.''
   ``The gross neglect of the State Department's
counterintelligence may be germane to the alleged security breaches
in Moscow,'' the report said.
   _Some of the Soviet citizens working at the embassy were ``known
to be KGB operatives,'' and were ``accorded far too much access to
Americans.''
   The Americans had ``ambivalent and contradictory'' attitudes
towards the Soviets, who worked in a variety of administrative,
clerical and support jobs such as cooks, drivers and baby-sitters.
The Soviets removed their nationals from the embassy in October
1986.
   _The ambassador ``employed a management style that remained
aloof until a specific event occurred and required his attention.
... This was clearly inadequate.''
   Arthur A. Hartman, the U.S. ambassador in Moscow from 1981 until
1987, did not return telephone calls placed to his house and his
office. He has maintained that earlier reports about the embassy's
security problems were overblown.
   Sgt. Clayton J. Lonetree, an embassy guard in 1985 and 1986, was
convicted of espionage for giving the KGB the identities of CIA
agents and the floor plans to the U.S. embassies in Moscow and
Vienna.
   But government prosecutors dropped charges against Lonetree and
Cpl. Arnold Bracy that they permitted KGB agents to roam the
embassy. Another Marine was convicted of dereliction of duty.
   The Naval Investigative Service says eight other
espionage-related cases involving Marines remain open as a result
of polygraph tests administered after Lonetree's confession.
   Besides Laird, the panel included Richard M. Helms, a former CIA
director; Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff; and Diego C. Asencio, former ambassador to Brazil.
   Also Thursday, the office of Rep. Dan Mica, D-Fla., made
available copies of a preliminary General Accounting Office inquiry
into reports of espionage by Marines. Mica had disclosed details of
the report last week.
   Among others things, the GAO _ the congressional watchdog agency
_ said ``coordination and cooperation'' between the State
Department, the Marines and the Naval Investigative Service was
``less than adequate.''
   For instance, the GAO said the State Department did not always
turn over to the NIS for further investigation reports of possible
criminal or counterintelligence activity.

   The value of U.S. agriculture exports is
expected to rise to a four-year high of $32.5 billion this fiscal
year, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Spurred by recent heavy sales of grain to the Soviet Union and
China, partly under a special export subsidy program, the new 1988
forecast is up $500 million from $32 billion indicated on Dec. 17.
   The new export forecast came just as the department announced
another cash sale of corn to the Soviet Union, the second in two
days.
   Overall, with a shipment value of $32 billion, exports in the
fiscal year that began Oct. 1 would be up 16 percent from $27.9
billion in 1987 and up 24 percent from a decade low of $26.3
billion in 1986. Agricultural export were valued at $31.2 billion
in fiscal 1985 and $38 billion in 1984.
   ``Most of the increase (from the earlier estimate) stems from
additional wheat sales under the Export Enhancement Program ,''
USDA said. ``Since the December forecast, EEP offers were announced
for 2 million metric tons of wheat to the Soviet Union and 1.2
million tons to China, among others.''
   Under the EEP arrangement, private exporters get free surplus
commodities from the Agriculture Department as subsidies so they
can sell grain and other products overseas at reduced prices.
   On the basis of actual volume, 1988 exports were indicated at
142.5 million metric tons, up from 141 million forecast in December
and 129.2 million tons shipped last year.
   ``The U.S. share of the world market, particularly in grains and
cotton, is rising,'' officials said in their report. ``Relatively
low world prices and improved U.S. competitiveness through lower
(price support) loan rates, the EEP and a lower dollar have reduced
production incentives for foreign competitors.''
   Meanwhile, private exporters reported the sales of 601,600 tons
of corn for delivery to the Soviet Union this year under a
long-term supply agreement between the two countries.
   On Wednesday, the Soviets bought 350,000 tons of corn, the first
substantial amount since last October. Corn sales are not qualified
for EEP subsidies, however.
   No selling prices or other information about the corn sale were
disclosed. When subsidies are involved, the exporting firms,
quantities and amounts of EEP payments are shown, but not when
straight cash deals are involved.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 601,600 tons of
corn would be about 24 million bushels, having a farm value of
around $44 million at recent prices of about $1.82 per bushel.
   The corn is part of the grain the Soviet Union is committed to
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain.
The pact expires Sept. 30.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The
Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as
wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two
tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   With the latest purchases, the Soviets now have bought more than
2.6 million tons of corn, or two-thirds of the minimum of 4 million
tons specified by the agreement.
   By comparison, the Soviet Union has bought more than 6.3 million
tons of wheat at subsidized prices, plus 800,000 tons of soybeans
and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal for delivery this year.

   Military medical officials said Thursday that
improvements are needed in battlefield health care but conditions
have improved greatly since five years ago, when only one out of 10
casualties could expect adequate care.
   ``We have to spend either dollars or blood, and we prefer to
spend dollars,'' Navy Surgeon General James A. Zimble told a House
Armed Services subcommittee hearing.
   Zimble said congressional support will be needed for a plan to
attain wartime medical readiness by 1992.
   Dr. William Mayer, assistant secretary of defense for health
affairs, said that five years ago adequate medical attention would
have been available to only 10 percent of battlefield casualties.
After a year, improvements increased that figure to about 20
percent, Mayer said, describing condition as ``still grossly
unacceptable.''
   He said no comparable figures are available for present
conditions but more facilities are still needed abroad. He said
there is no funding for 41 overseas Army hospitals, in addition to
three for the Navy and two for the Air Force.
   Mayer said the U.S. military can now mobilize about 60 percent
of the medical personnel and facilities needed in the event of
``general war.''
   ``I'm very comfortable that we're most of the way toward being
able to respond adequately today in ways that we couldn't have
dreamed of five years ago,'' he told the subcommittee on medical
personnel and compensation which is examining military medical care
readiness abroad. The panel has scheduled a similar hearing on
domestic military medical facilities for March 8.
   Mayer said there is a danger that if improvements in health care
for the armed forces do not continue, it could become ``a national
scandal.''
   Air Force Surgeon General Murphy A. Chesney said he has
purchased 75 percent of the hospital beds that would be needed
overseas in wartime but there is no money to obtain the other 25
percent.
   He said that with the growth of Soviet offensive capabilities,
U.S. Air Force bases have to be considered ``first-strike
targets.'' He said in 1979 it was concluded that potential casualty
rates at air bases were 17 times those previously predicted.
   Since then, he said, the value of medical facilities has grown
from $17 million in 1978 to an expected $450 million when all
funded work is completed. But that still leaves the Air Force
needing 10 more hospitals with 500 beds each, he said.
   Army Surgeon General Quinn H. Becker said, ``Although we have
achieved admirable progress in correcting our medical readiness
shortfalls, critical equipment and personnel deficiences remain.''

   A student was shot in the head and
critically wounded by another male student Thursday in a courtyard
of Bristol High School, police and hospital officials said.
   According to witnesses, the victim was shot while pulling off
his jacket to fight with the other student, said Mike Slocum, a
senior at the school.
   The two youths had been fighting for weeks, said Kate Meyer, a
freshman.
   The 15-year-old was in critical condition with a single gunshot
wound in the head and was taken into surgery at Rhode Island
Hospital, said spokesman Rick Piester.
   Police Detective Richard Almeida said the shooting took place in
a school courtyard shortly after noon. Authorities reportedly had
at least one suspect in custody and have recovered a small-caliber
handgun.
   Neither Almeida nor Superintendent Gerald P. Bourgeois could
furnish the identities of either the shooting victim or suspect.
   Slocum said about 30 people were in the courtyard when the
shooting occurred.
   Several students interviewed said they did not witness the
shooting but saw the victim sprawled on the floor seconds later.
   Gloria Meola, a freshman, described herself as a close friend of
the victim. ``I saw him lying on the floor ... all that blood,''
she said, wincing. ``I saw him on that floor, and I freaked out.''
   Meola said the suspect ran into the school and, with the help of
another student, escaped through a window.
   Slocum and several other students described the shooting suspect
as a student who was frequently teased. ``The truth is, he was a
geek,'' he said.
   Meola said that after the shooting Principal Edward L. Jawor
told students over the intercom not to talk to reporters, ``like
we're going to act like it's a normal day and our close friend just
got shot in the head.''

   Television evangelist Jimmy
Swaggart's admission of moral failure isn't expected to hinder
development of a $2 million Canadian headquarters, says his
representative in Canada.
   The Rev. Norman MacLaren, who has headed Swaggart's Canadian
operation since 1983, said he was planning a new building for his
200-member congregation in Niagara Falls 10 months ago and decided
to make it large enough to serve also as the Canadian headquarters
for Jimmy Swaggart Ministries.
   A foundation has been laid for the building, which will include
a 1,300-seat sanctuary. The building is expected to be finished by
Nov. 30.
   MacLaren said his church is a member of the Pentecostal
Assemblies of Canada, which is affiliated with the Assemblies of
God denomination of which Swaggart is a member.
   Asked if the TV evangelist's temporary absence from the pulpit
and othe4r disciplinary action by the denomination will affect the
local plans, MacLaren said ``we trust it won't.''
   Between 35,000 and 40,000 Canadians subscribe to Swaggart's
evangelical magazine, he said. This is the group that will be
served by the headquarters in Niagara Falls.
   Being the Swaggart headquarters means handling all Canadian
distribution of the evangelist's music, TV tapes and literature and
processing all incoming mail, MacLaren said.

   Hundreds of Bruce Springsteen fans lined
up Thursday outside the Worcester Centrum arena vainly seeking
tickets for the sold-out opening concert of the Boss' nationwide
``Tunnel of Love'' tour.
   ``We do have have some people outside who are not believing
us,'' said Centrum marketing director Kathleen Heinz. ``They think
they will be more tickets. We're telling them that's not the case.
The tickets are all sold.''
   More than 13,000 fans held tickets for the Thursday night
concert.
   During an appearance Wednesday in Boston, Springsteen promised
``plenty of surprises'' in the three sold-out dates at the arena.
   Worcester police Deputy Chief Edward O'Brien said 30 officers
were stationed at the Centrum for crowd control and to hunt down
ticket scalpers, who reportedly were reaping up to $600 a ticket.
   A 23-year-old Worcester man was arrested after he allegedly sold
two $20 tickets to a plainclothes police officer for $400. Police
seized four tickets to Thursday's show and two for the final
Worcester show on Monday, and the man was fined $525 for reselling
tickets and selling tickets without a license.
   And in case anyone was wondering, Worcester cobbler David
Jennette says Springsteen wears a size 10D boot.
   ``I didn't believe it when we got the call Tuesday night asking
if we'd do some work on Bruce Springsteen's boots. I thought it was
a prank,'' Jennette said. ``We were just closing up so I said `OK,
come right over,' thinking it was some kid calling up.''
   It was no joke. A few minutes later, Springsteen's road manager
appeared with a pair of boots and asked to have the leather soles
replaced with non-skid rubber soles.
   Jennette was invited to Springsteen's rehearsal and took his
sister-in-law along.
   ``Bruce was great. After the rehearsal he came over and talked
to us and let us take pictures with him,'' he said.

   Singer Wayne Newton, who made a bigger hit in
Las Vegas than President Reagan did, came to the White House on
Thursday to get an award from Reagan for entertaining members of
the armed services.
   Newton, one of the biggest draws in the Nevada entertainment
capital, showed up in the lead car of a caravan of three stretch
limousines to collect a plaque for his tours on behalf of the
United Service Organizations.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Newton gave a
Thanksgiving tour aboard ships in the Mediterranean and has also
toured the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf.
   ``We talked about his Las Vegas years,'' Newton said of his
conversation with the president. ``I didn't sing for him and he
didn't sing for me, and I think we'll probably keep it that way.''
   Reagan worked briefly as a night club master of ceremonies in
Las Vegas after his movie career faltered and before he entered
politics.

<HEAD>Criminal Probe Possible in FBI Agent's Racism Claims, Justice Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grand jury may investigate possible criminal
wrongdoing stemming from a black FBI agent's claims that he was the
victim of racial harassment by fellow agents, a government lawyer
said Thursday.
   Justice Department attorney David M. Glass told the judge who is
hearing a civil lawsuit brought by FBI Special Agent Donald Rochon
that the department was conducting a criminal investigation of the
case.
   ``There has been some consideration of criminal proceedings,''
Glass told U.S. District Judge Charles R. Richey.
   Glass made the statement in response to the plaintiff's request
to examine FBI documents and investigative files to prepare for the
case for trial.
   Glass contended that opening the files to Rochon's lawyers could
interfere with the investigation being conducted by the criminal
division of the Justice Department's civil rights division.
   Rochon, 37, charged in the lawsuit filed last fall that fellow
agents in Omaha and later Chicago waged a three-year campaign of
harassment that included a letter threatening death, mutilation and
sexual assault of his white wife.
   An FBI agent was suspended for two weeks for forging Rochon's
name on an application for an insurance policy covering his death
or dismemberment and another for burial benefits, according to the
lawsuit.
   A department source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
investigators are examining letters containing threats to obtain
corroboration of Rochon's charges.
   The letters are being examined to determine if the mails were
illegally used to harass Rochon, the source said.
   Rochon also claims the FBI retaliated against him for
complaining by transferring him to Chicago and placing a letter of
censure in his personnel file. The lawsuit also charges that FBI
officials deliberately ignored his allegations to suppress them.
   On his first day on the job in Chicago, Rochon says agents
placed chocolate in the earpiece of his telephone so that it would
come off on his ear when he used the instrument.
   During a four-day period in the spring of 1985, Rochon says he
received a letter threatening him with violence, mutilation and
death as well as sexual assault of his wife, Susan. The letter
contained a picture of a mutilated black man, the complaint says.
   Four days later, Rochon received a bill for an insurance policy
for death and dismemberment that had been taken out in his name.
   The lawsuit states that FBI officials in Chicago gave agent Gary
Miller a 14-day suspension after determining that he had forged
Rochon's signature on the insurance application and on another for
death and burial benefits.
   But the FBI did not report Miller's actions to prosecutors
``although he clearly violated federal and state criminal laws,''
the lawsuit said.
   The lawsuit charges that in 1986, the Justice Department's civil
rights division deliberately shut down the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission's investigation of allegations of harassment
in Chicago, saying it was conducting a criminal investigation.
   Rochon's lawsuit charges that even though the Justice Department
notified the EEOC of the criminal investigation, it did not
interview Rochon or agents suspected of wrongdoing until last
summer.
   Last summer the EEOC ruled that Rochon was unfairly disciplined
in Omaha and transferred to Chicago. The EEOC ordered the FBI to
allow Rochon to be transferred to any office of his choice within
the agency.
   EEOC also ordered the FBI to lift the 1984 letter of censure,
which rebuked Rochon for failing to report that he was the victim
of possible housing discrimination.
   The EEOC examiner determined that Rochon was the only FBI
special agent ever censured for failing to report a legal violation
of which he was the victim.
   The EEOC also ordered FBI training sessions for the agents
involved in the racial harassment to ensure such conduct would not
be repeated.
   During the hearing, the judge urged the Justice Department to
find a way to settle the lawsuit to avoid lengthy court proceedings.

Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities have seized the home of a 90-year-old
woman and evicted a family they say terrorized and beat her and
stole thousands of dollars from her over the past few years.
   The retired teacher, whom authorities declined to identify, has
cancer and was taken to a nursing home several days before police
moved in. She has not been told about the raid and eviction,
officials said.
   Eight district attorney's investigators, two police lab
technicians and two patrolmen raided the house Tuesday night after
relatives became alarmed and called authorities.
   They evicted the live-in housekeeper and her son and
daughter-in-law.
   ``We have evidence at this point of emotional, verbal and
physical abuse _ things that really make you angry to hear about,''
said Dave Heckenbach, chief deputy district attorney.
   ``Like smacking her when she doesn't move fast enough, pushing
her down when she doesn't drink her fluids fast enough, bruises on
her body, bumps on her head, yelling at her, screaming at her,
threatening her,'' he said.
   No charges had been filed as of Thursday.
   ``We recovered numerous documents that we will have to go
through before charges can be filed,'' said Diane Balkin of the
district attorney's office.
   The woman's troubles began in early 1985 when she advertised for
a live-in housekeeper and hired Lois Hicks, 62, authorities said.
   Ms. Hicks took control of the woman's finances and
``substantially depleted her money,'' said Heckenbach.
   ``We don't know the totals yet,'' Heckenbach said, but financial
documents were seized when the house was raided. He said that just
two bank withdrawal slips that he saw showed withdrawals from the
woman's account of $15,000 and $22,000.
   ``And they seized many more than what I saw,'' he said. ``I can
say easily that we are into the many tens of thousands of dollars
that these people took from this lady.''
   Two years ago, officials said, Ms. Hicks' son, John Hicks, 34,
and his wife, Cheryl Hicks, 35, moved into the house with their
eight cats, a dog and a ferret.
   Heckenbach said both John Hicks and his wife are ex-convicts.
Cheryl Hicks was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and murder in
Georgia, and John Hicks was convicted of aggravated robbery in
Georgia, he said. The two met in a halfway house and had been out
of prison a short time when they moved into the elderly woman's
home, said Heckenbach.
   The family hired their own housekeeper and bought three cars,
said Heckenbach.
   Heckenbach said that last October, Lois Hicks told the teacher's
lawyer that the elderly woman wanted to change her will.
   ``The attorney, to his credit, refused to change the will
because his assessment was that she was not mentally able to make a
voluntary decision at that point,'' he said.
   ``He also told us he saw fear in her eyes and terror in her
eyes,'' Heckenbach said. ``It was his distinct impression she was
being intimidated by Lois Hicks.''
   John Hicks was out of town, but Lois and Cheryl Hicks were at
the house when officials seized it. They were allowed to take some
clothing and toiletries before they were locked out, officials said.

   Barbara Cook will not appear in ``Carrie,'' a
musical version of the Stephen King novel, when it arrives on
Broadway in April, a spokesman for the show said Thursday.
   Miss Cook, who was the original Marian the librarian in ``The
Music Man,'' will withdraw from the show after it completes its
pre-Broadway run in Stratford, England, on March 5, said the show's
spokesman Jim Baldassare.
   In the musical, Miss Cook plays Carrie's mother. The title
character, a teen-age girl with telekinetic powers, is played by a
17-year-old English actress named Linzi Hateley.
   Miss Cook's decision to leave the show was based on
consultations between the actress, director Terry Hands and
producer Friedrich Kurz, Baldassare said. Several performers are
under consideration to replace Miss Cook but no offer has been
made, the spokesman said. The show was to have been Miss Cook's
first appearance in a Broadway musical in 17 years. Her one-woman
show had a short run on Broadway last spring.
   ``Carrie,'' which also was turned into a Brian de Palma movie
starring Sissy Spacek, has music by Michael Gore and lyrics by Dean
Pitchford.
   The show is scheduled to begin preview performances at the
Virginia Theater on April 12 and open on May 1.

   Two common antibiotics used against traveler's
diarrhea helped a group of AIDS patients live longer by preventing
the pneumonia that is a leading cause of death from the disease, a
study found.
   The drug therapy gives doctors an important new weapon in the
fight against AIDS, a fatal, incurable immune disorder, one of the
study's authors said Thursday.
   ``If we intercede early with medications that may prevent
life-threatening infections, that will prolong life and improve the
quality of life,'' said Dr. Margaret Fischl, lead researcher on the
study published in Friday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   The two antibiotics, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole,
prevented 30 patients with early stages of AIDS from developing
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia while they remained on the drugs
   The patients also lived much longer than 30 similar patients who
did not receive the drugs, said Ms. Fischl, an associate medical
professor and director of AIDS research at the University of Miami
School of Medicine.
   The patients each had been newly diagnosed as having Kaposi's
sarcoma, a skin cancer that afflicts AIDS patients. But they hadn't
developed pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or any of the other
opportunistic infections that eventually kill AIDS victims, the
study said.
   ``More than 50 percent of patients with AIDS develop
pneumocystis carinii infection and, despite therapy, more than 20
percent die with overwhelming infection,'' the study noted.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the
body's defenses against disease, leaving its victims prey to
infections and certain cancers.
   The patients were studied between January 1984 and June 1985,
and were re-examined in June 1987.
   Sixteen of the 30 patients who didn't receive the antibiotics
developed the pneumonia, the study results showed.
   None of the 30 patients taking the antibiotics developed the
pneumonia while they received the drugs, the study said.
   But half of those receiving the drugs had side effects such as
nausea and skin rashes, the study said. Five had such severe
reactions they had to stop taking the antibiotics, it said. Four of
the five developed the pneumonia within four or five months after
the treatment was halted.
   During the study, 28 of the 30 patients _ 93 percent _ not
receiving the antibiotics died, compared with 18 patients, or 60
percent, in the group that took the drugs.
   Ms. Fischl estimated that 40 percent of the patients who took
the drugs remain alive today. Only one patient who wasn't given the
drugs is still living, she said by telephone from her Miami office.
   A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1982
found that the same two prescription antibiotics were effective in
quickly relieving the misery of travelers' diarrhea, a disorder
common to visitors of Latin America, the Middle East, the Far East
and the Mediterranean.
   Ms. Fischl recommended Thursday that all patients with AIDS and
AIDS-related illness, a condition called ARC, be considered for
therapy with the two antibotics.
   Similar tests are being conducted on other antibiotics to see if
they also may be effective in preventing AIDS-related infections,
she said.
   Ms. Fischl speculated that the medical technique known as
chemoprophylaxis _ trying to prevent infections with low doses of
antibotics _ may become a major weapon against AIDS and be used in
conjunction with other drugs, such as AZT.
   AZT, or azidothymidine, has been shown to prolong the lives of
AIDS patients by reducing the frequency and severity of
opportunistic infections, like the rare pneumonia.
   ``Perhaps the combination of chemoprophylaxis with AZT will
improve the outcome better than either alone,'' said Ms. Fischl,
who also has directed studies of AZT.
   The virus that causes AIDS is believed to be passed mainly
through sexual intercourse, shared hypodermic needles and from
infected mothers to their infants before or during birth.

<HEAD>Teen-Ager Becomes Hero Third Time With Rescue Of Man From Wreck</HEAD>

   A 17-year-old student athlete became a
hero for the third time in his life when he went to the aid of a
man whose van had plunged into a canyon, giving the man his jacket
and shirt to ward off hypothermia.
   Duane Duffy was on his way home from a school club meeting in
Colorado Springs on Tuesday night when he saw a strange light in
the trees in the canyon 300 feet below the road.
   ``I knew it wasn't the moon,'' Duffy said. ``Most people would
drive right by, because if you didn't know any better you wouldn't
have noticed it.''
   But Duffy drives the road every day, so he stopped to
investigate.
   Peering over the precipice, he saw the headlights of a smashed
van and heard a weak cry for help.
   Tom Dize, 44, of Denver, had slipped off the road into the
canyon while attempting a U-turn.
   Duffy went off and called for help, then returned to climb down
the nearly vertical dropoff. He found Dize in bad condition.
   ``I thought he was really getting close to hypothermia,'' or low
body temperature, said Duffy. ``He'd been out there 15 to 20
minutes, sprawled in the snow, and it was really deep. He was
shaking and shivering. He was all wet and white, and breathing
heavily. It really freaked me out.''
   ``I knew I was going to die,'' Dize recalled from his hospital
bed.
   Duffy helped Dize walk to the road, then took off his jacket and
shirt and wrapped the injured man in them and in blankets from his
car. He waited with Dize until an ambulance arrived.
   ``If it hadn't been for him, I might not have made it,'' said
Dize, who was in satisfactory condition at St. Anthony Hospital
Central in Denver, where he was recovering from internal injuries.
   ``He put the blankets on me, comforted me, stayed with me. I owe
my life to him, really.''
   Duffy's father, Duane Duffy, said his son had rescued a brother
and sister years earlier.
   When he was 12, he saved his 10-year-old brother from drowning
during a fishing trip. Two years ago, he treated his 3-year-old
sister after she ate rat poison, making her drink milk to coat her
stomach and calling paramedics.
   ``Like every teen, he's rebellious,'' said the father. ``But
being the oldest of seven children, he's assumed a lot of
leadership. You can criticize kids from day to day, get down on
them, and you forget to look at the basic things. We've tried to
teach the kids good values, and it looks like I've gotten some
reward for that.''

<HEAD>Legislation Would Aid Consumers' Dealing With Banks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reps. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., and Joseph
P. Kennedy, D-Mass., introduced legislation Thursday designed to
aid consumers in their dealing with banks.
   Schumer and Kennedy, both members of the House Banking Committee
_ joined by a coalition of representatives of consumer groups,
including activist Ralph Nader _ told a news conference they hoped
their measure would be included in major legislation to restructure
banking regulations.
   ``As the bank and securities industries argue about how to
divide up the goodies of the financial system, Congress must make
sure that consumers get a fair shake,'' said Schumer. ``Whether or
not Congress grants banks any new powers, Congress must address the
concerns of consumers and communities.''
   Kennedy said that no matter what Congress does on the
Glass-Steagall law, which restricts the role of banks, ``local
communities and consumers deserve to have their rights under the
law enforced.''
   Schumer and Kennedy said their legislation will offer an
opportunity for every person to have a bank account, establish
community organizations to monitor bank performance and will
provide better information about the credit given to businesses in
poor communities.
   The measure requires that banks make available basic checking
accounts to all consumers for a minimal initial deposit. These
accounts would be free of all fees and charges for a limited number
of checking services.
   It also will require regular disclosure of where banks are
lending their depositors' money, giving consumers a better picture
of whether the banks they patronize are serving the community which
supports them, according to Schumer.
   A third provision would establish a system of state-level
organizations to inform and represent consumers' interests before
regulatory authorities, courts, legislatures and other forums.

<HEAD>DEA: Southeast Asian Heroin Dominates In New York</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Heroin Influx, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southeast Asian heroin importers have supplanted
the Mafia as the largest supplier of the drug in New York, vastly
increasing their share of the illicit market since 1983,
authorities said Thursday.
   However, investigations of the drug rings have led to major
recent seizures of New York-bound heroin in Thailand and Chicago,
said Robert Strang, spokesman for the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration here.
   Five years ago an estimated 4 percent of the heroin reaching New
York was from Southeast Asia and the remaining 96 percent was from
Iran, Afghanistan and Pakistan, where the Mafia dominated the
distribution network, Strang said.
   Now, an estimated 70 percent of the heroin comes from Southeast
Asia _ principally Thailand, Laos and Burma _ imported by gangs
based in Hong Kong and Bangkok, while the share from Iran,
Afghanistan and Pakistan is down to 30 percent, he said.
   Officials are unsure of the reason for the decreasing role of
organized crime, but they speculate that one factor is retrenchment
and disarray in the Mafia ranks caused by recent successful
prosecutions of Mafia leaders in New York.
   The Southeast Asian heroin has an average street-level purity of
45 percent, compared with 15 percent for heroin from Iran,
Afghanistan and Pakistan, Strang noted. Nonetheless, wholesale
prices have remained level, ranging from $75,000 to $150,000 per
pound, he said.
   The DEA responded to the increasing role of Bangkok and Hong
Kong heroin gangs by forming a special investigative group 1{ years
ago, Strang said. The group led to seizures of 180 pounds of heroin
in New York in December, 165 pounds this week in Chicago and nearly
1{ tons in Thailand earlier this month.

<HEAD>Bomb Wounds 14 At Celebrations Marking Marcos Ouster</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES W. HATTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb exploded near a crowded stage
late Thursday and wounded 14 people at the climax of celebrations
marking the second anniversary of the popular uprising that ousted
President Ferdinand E. Marcos.
   Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, chief of the National Capital Region
Defense Command, told The Associated Press there was no indication
who planted the homemade device, and no one claimed responsibility.
The military had been on full alert in case communist rebels or
militant rightists tried to disrupt the celebration.
   Biazon said the bomb went off during a fireworks display at the
end of daylong celebrations marking the Feb. 25, 1986 ouster of the
Marcos administration.
   Elisa Florido, a nurse at Medical City Hospital, said no one was
seriously hurt. She said most of the injured suffered cuts from
flying glass and debris.
   The blast occurred at about 10 p.m. near the main stage set up
on Epifanio de los Santos Avenue. Seven stages were erected along
the highway, known as EDSA, for religious services and performances
by Filipino entertainers.
   Two years ago, hundreds of thousands of Filipinos swarmed onto
EDSA to form a human wall shielding troops who mutinied against
Marcos after a fraud-tainted election. The uprising swept Corazon
Aquino into the presidency.
   During a Mass attended by Mrs. Aquino Thursday, Cardinal Jaime
L. Sin, archbishop of Manila, appealed for land reform and warned
that the country cannot survive if it does not narrow the gap
between rich and poor.
   ``We have to bring about a more equitable distribution of wealth
throughout our land,'' Sin said. ``Only then can our nation survive
and go forward.
   ``It (land reform) can no longer wait. Many believe it is
already too late. The insurgency, now so much advanced, is at the
gates.''
   More than half the nation's 58 million people live in poverty
that has fueled the 19-year-old communist rebellion.
   Mrs. Aquino ordered land reform last July but left implementing
details to Congress, where the bill has bogged down because of
resistance by landowners.
   During the Mass, Mrs. Aquino made no speech but offered a prayer:
   ``Lord God, you helped us on EDSA two years ago, and we thank
you for helping us all through these difficult two years. ... We
believe that you led us out of bondage. We believe that it was you
who made us free.''
   About 10,000 leftists marked the day with a march and rally, at
which speakers claimed Mrs. Aquino had abandoned the reformist
goals of the 1986 revolution. Hundreds of Marcos supporters also
rallied to demand his return from exile in Hawaii.
   In Honolulu, Marcos said that after two years in exile, he
considers himself a prisoner in the United States. He vowed to
continue his fight to return home, though he said he expects to be
killed by his enemies.
   U.S. officials will not allow Marcos to return to the
Philippines because the Aquino government believes he and his wife
would disrupt the country's political stability.
   The explosion Thursday night was the only incident that marred
the celebrations in Manila, in which tens of thousands of Filipinos
returned to EDSA for a carnival of religious processions and street
dancing.
   The celebration began with the pealing of church bells across
the nation and a flag-raising ceremony at Camp Aguinaldo military
garrison. Mrs. Aquino joined thousands of people outside the camp
to hold hands in a 1{-mile-long ``chain for peace'' down EDSA.
   It was at Camp Aguinaldo where former Defense Minister Juan
Ponce Enrile and Lt. Gen. Fidel Ramos, then the vice chief of
staff, announced they were breaking with Marcos and backing Mrs.
Aquino.
   The mutiny galvanized opposition to Marcos which swelled after
the 1983 assassination of Mrs. Aquino's husband, former Sen.
Benigno Aquino Jr.
   Mrs. Aquino promised broad social and economic reform, but
critics complain she failed to meet the goals because of strong
opposition from conservative groups within the military and the
elite.

   A man taken into custody at a campus dormitory
grabbed an officer's gun and opened fire early Thursday, wounding
three people before fleeing, authorities said.
   The suspect, believed to be a 28-year-old student, apparently is
the same person who was arrested Wednesday after allegedly fighting
with a former roommate at the University of Houston-Downtown dorm.
That man was released from the Harris County Jail later Wednesday,
officials said.
   ``He returned to the dorm and started making threats,''
university spokeswoman Martha Cantu said. ``I think (the threats)
were in general.''
   Campus police were called to the dorm to check on a reported
disturbance. One person was taken into custody and then moved to
the university's main building, where two campus police officers
and a maintenance worker were wounded during a scuffle, university
spokesman Andy Gomez said.
   There were conflicting reports as to what time the student was
first taken into custody. Gomez said it was about 2:30 a.m.
Thursday, but Ms. Cantu said the student may have been taken into
custody late Wednesday.
   Ms. Cantu said that the shootings occurred after campus officer
Jim Durbin tried to handcuff the suspect, who apparently got
Durbin's .357-caliber revolver during a scuffle and fired four
shots.
   Durbin was in good condition with a wound in an armpit, Ms.
Cantu said. The other officer was shot in the head and was in
serious condition and the maintenance worker underwent surgery
Thursday, she said.
   Classes continued Thursday for the estimated 7,200 students
enrolled at the downtown branch of the University of Houston.

   A 16-year-old black girl who says she was
kidnapped and raped by six white men would sooner go to jail than
testify before a grand jury empaneled by state Attorney General
Robert Abrams, a minister said Thursday.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, a minister from New York City who is
advising the family of Tawana Brawley, said Gov. Mario Cuomo is
using ``macho politics'' in trying to compel testimony from the
girl from Wappingers Falls, north of New York City.
   ``I see no fear for her (Tawana), her family, her lawyers and
myself for going to jail,'' said Sharpton, who said he met earlier
Thursday with the Brawley family. ``You're probably safer in jail
than you are in the streets.''
   Miss Brawley was found wrapped in a garbage bag and covered with
feces, with racial insults scrawled on her body, after being
missing for four days last November. She said she was assaulted by
six white men, one of whom flashed a police badge.
   On Wednesday Cuomo called on Abrams, who he has appointed as a
special prosecutor in the case, to ask a grand jury when it
convenes Monday in Poughkeepsie to force Miss Brawley and her
family to cooperate with investigators.
   ``Someone is going to give him a macho award for beating up on a
young girl who has already been abused,'' Sharpton said of Cuomo.
   According to Sharpton, the Brawleys and their advisers continue
to seek assurances that Abrams will be personally involved in the
investigation and trial of the case. In addition, he said the
family remains troubled by what he maintains is the ``special
relationship'' between Abrams and Dutchess County Sheriff Frederick
Scoralick, who one newspaper has reported as being implicated in
the case by Miss Brawley.
   The family's advisers are also concerned that Abrams has not
posted a reward for information in the case and that details of
private meetings between the attorney general and Brawley attorneys
C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox Jr. earlier this month were
revealed by Abrams' office.
   Timothy Gilles, spokesman for Abrams, did not return a phone
call seeking comment Thursday.
   Maddox and Mason, of New York City, have called for Abrams'
ouster as special prosecutor and asked for the naming of a
permanent state prosecutor to investigate race-related crimes.
   The Brawleys, Sharpton said, have even less trust in the state
since Tuesday's revelation that a former printing employee of
Abrams was arrested and charged with stealing and disclosing a
transcript of testimony taken before a previous Dutchess County
grand jury.
   ``They have made a joke of the grand jury by the robbery,''
Sharpton said. ``Are you going to tell me that if Tawana goes
before the grand jury that a printer isn't going to rob her
testimony?''
   John Poklemba, Cuomo's aide who advised the governor on the
appointment of a special prosecutor, said Wednesday that despite
the objections of Miss Brawley's representatives, he saw no reason
to remove Abrams from the case.
   Sharpton noted that Miss Brawley and her family have defied a
grand jury subpoena already. That court order was issued earlier
this year at the request of Dutchess County District Attorney
William Grady, who later asked to be removed from the case because
of an unspecified conflicts of interest.

<HEAD>Subcommittee Urges Tougher Penalties To Fight Looting Of Indian
Artifacts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tougher federal laws are needed to stem the
dramatically increased rate of Indian artifacts looted and
vandalized in the Southwest, a House subcommittee said Thursday.
   A report by the House Interior and Insular Affairs subcommittee
on general oversight and investigations, capping a four-month
probe, said up to 90 percent of the archaeological Indian sites in
Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah may have been vandalized.
   The subcommittee called it an ``extremely serious problem which
threatens our national heritage.''
   The 73-page report, issued by Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn.,
chairman of the panel, said vandalism reports have increased by
1,000 percent since 1980 on the Navajo Reservation alone.
   ``If the rate of looting on other Indian lands is as serious ...
the looting problem on Indian land is reaching crisis
proportions,'' the subcommittee concluded.
   Looting in the Southwest is especially severe because of the
value of certain artifacts. For example, an Indian basket and its
contents were sold by a dealer for $180,000.
   The panel recommended revising a law currently in effect that
separates misdemeanors and felonies by a $5,000 threshold on the
artifacts stolen or destroyed. Instead, the report suggested making
digging for artifacts a felony and ``surface collecting'' a
misdeamanor.
   ``The $5,000 threshold causes many problems as it is extremely
difficult to quantify the value of damage to archaeological
sites,'' the report said. ``This is a clear distinction, which
juries and judges can understand without the assistance of an
expert.''
   The subcommittee also said the law should be changed to make it
a crime to attempt to loot or vandalize archaeological sites on
federal lands. Now looters have to be caught in the act.
   The panel wants to have the law apply to artifacts that are at
least 50 years old, instead of the current 100-year-old standard.
   In addition, the lawmakers called for more undercover operations
and patrols, including patrols at archaeological sites that are
important but not protected under the National Historic
Preservation Act.
   The subcommittee said the government should focus on education
and advertising efforts, noting that while many looters are seeking
a profit, some are just archaeology enthusiasts unaware of the need
to protect the artifacts.
   ``The key to protecting archaeological resources is to convince
the general public of their value,'' the report said.

   Two top strategists for Republican
presidential candidate Bob Dole were fired Thursday in the
culmination of an apparent power struggle that erupted as the
Kansas senator was grearing up for the single biggest day of the
1988 campaign.
   Consultants David Keene and Don Devine left Dole's campaign in
Florida, according to campaign manager Bill Brock.
   ``We're in the process of trying to tighten up on resources,''
Dole said, but he also acknowledged, ``There is tension in any
campaign.''
   Brock said he decided on the firings and notified Dole Wednesday
night.
   ``We don't have any philosophical differences,'' said Brock, a
former senator from Tennessee. ``We're in a different kind of
campaign at this time.''
   Brock said other changes were forthcoming, adding that some Dole
personnel in the national headquarters would be asked to go into
the field for the Kansas senator.
   Keene and Devine flew with Dole on the candidate's chartered
plane when he headed south from Minnesota on Wednesday after his
victories in the South Dakota primary and Minnesota precinct
caucuses.
   Devine, in a telephone interview, said Brock had called them
Tuesday night and ordered them off the plane.
   Both refused, saying they worked for Dole.
   Brock joined the entourage Thursday in Orlando, Fla., after a
day of campaign stops in South Carolina and Florida. And Devine
said that while Dole was delivering a speech, a photographer asked
Brock and Keene to stand together for a picture.
   According to Devine, as the two men stood together, Brock leaned
over and said to Keene, ``We're going to cut the string on you
right now.''
   Then he looked at Devine and said, ``I might as well do both of
you together.''
   Devine said the dispute flared when Brock advised Dole not to go
to South Dakota and Minnesota Tuesday night, despite indications
the senator would carry both states.
   Keene and Devine argued that Dole should go and the senator
agreed.
   During his appearance before the Jacksonville Chamber of
Commerce, Dole said he considered the Republican race a two-man
battle between himself and Vice President George Bush.
   ``I've got a feeling we may be headed all the way to New
Orleans,'' said Dole, referring to the Republican National
Convention in August.
   Aiming his remarks at conservative Republicans in a city that
hosts three huge naval bases, Dole praised President Reagan's
leadership and pitched his remarks toward strong support of the
Strategic Defense Initiative. But he also urged resolving the
federal budget deficit.
   ``The biggest single threat in America ... in my view, is the
deficit,'' said Dole. ``You have a right to insist we deal with the
deficit.''
   Dole said the country needed to control wasteful Pentagon
spending with an inspector general ``meaner than a junkyard dog,''
but said he would not compromise on defense.
   ``If I'm going to make a mistake on defense, I ant to be sure
I've spent enough,'' said the senator.
   Dole also spoke before the Florida Association of Counties
mid-year legislative congress and attended a rally on his behalf
before flyig to Texas.
   Florida and Texas are the two largest of the 20 states that have
contests on March 8, known as Super Tuesday.
   Earlier, at an Orlando campaign stop, Dole told reporters that
Bush had brought a disinformation campaign to Florida.
   Dole complained that TV ads now running in Miami, which were
also used by the Bush campaign in New Hampshire and Vermont,
distort Dole's views on several issues.
   He said the ads say that ``Dole can't wait to raise your taxes,
then there's something about import fees and something about the
INF (nuclear missiles) treaty _ all of which is totally
inaccurate.''
   Later, posing at the Universal Studios construction site with
cartoon and movie characters Woody Woodpecker and Frankenstein's
monster, the Kansas senator quipped that ``we have a broad-based
campaign. ... It's reaching new heights.''

   Doug Watson says he's not the greatest salesman
who ever lived, but then how many of his competitors can say
they've sold 117,000 pounds of ice to Fairbanks, Alaska?
   The ice, 390 blocks weighing 300 pounds each, was loaded into
refrigerator trucks Thursday for the first leg of the voyage to the
Fairbanks Ice Festival.
   The price tage was $2,350 with the Fairbanks Convention and
Visitor Bureau also paying for the shipping.
   The shipment from Rainier Ice Co. is due in Fairbanks on March
7, in time for three ice sculptors from Harbin, China, to render
their artwork by the festival's March 18 start.
   ``I thought when they called me about buying the ice that it
gets cold up there and they should have all they want,'' Watson
said.
   ``We don't have the right kind of ice in Alaska,'' said Susan
Stolpe, a spokeswoman for the Fairbanks convention bureau. ``We
need de-oxygenated ice, which is clearer.''
   The ice festival runs through March 20 and celebrates the
approach of spring with dogsled races, art exhibits and a parade of
locally made parkas.

   Employees at a downtown office building have
received a memo suggesting that their visits to restrooms be
wrapped up in 12 minutes _ or they'll be left in the dark.
   Motion sensors that control lights will be installed in the next
few weeks in all restrooms of the building occupied by Cities
Service Oil and Gas Corp.
   The sensors will detect motion when people pass and turn on
lights. If no motion is detected for 12 minutes, the devices will
turn the lights out, according to the memo.
   A spokesman said the devices have been tested in one men's room
in the building and have been found to be effective in reducing
electricity use.

<HEAD>Portuguese Leader Sees Pivotal U.S. Role In Angola In Next Months</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States plays a pivotal role in
Portugal's former African colony of Angola and has a chance to end
Cuban and South African involvement there in the next four months,
Portugese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva said.
   ``This is the right time,'' Cavaco Silva told the National Press
Club. ``If the agreement is not obtained, it is my opinion, in the
next four months, perhaps it will not be achieved in the next two
years.''
   The main factor, he said, is next November's U.S. elections and
the change of administrations.
   ``Perhaps the next administration will take some time, perhaps
two years, to make a new assessment of foreign policy in relation
to that area,'' Cavaco Silva said. ``And it would be a pity because
the suffering of the people will continue, and the opportunities of
economic recovery will be lost.''
   Cavaco Silva said he had discussed Angola with President Reagan
on Wednesday and also with Secretary of State George Shultz and
Chester Crocker, assistant secretary of state for African affairs.
   Crocker has been conducting talks with the Angolan government
for much of the Reagan administration to try to arrange a pullout
of some 40,000 Cuban troops from Angola, which would be coordinated
with South Africa's granting independence to South-West Africa, or
Namibia.
   ``The government of Angola is experiencing big difficulties _
economic difficulties of the decline in oil prices,'' Cacavo Silva
said. It also has suffered a setback in recent fighting with UNITA
rebels, in part because of the intervention of South African
troops, he said. Government troops ``are on retreat now,'' he said.
   ``The United States administration is in a position to achieve a
retreat of the Cuban troops and to explain the arrangement to the
South Africans ... and to force the necessary steps for the
independence of Namibia,'' Cavaco Silva said.
   He said his government has urged Angola to reach an agreement
now and that the Angolan government has accepted the principle of
the total withdrawal of the Cuban troops. ``The difficulty is to
fix the timetable,'' he said.
   ``It is necessary to have in mind that that agreement afterwards
has to be negotiated with South Africa,'' Cavaco Silva said. ``And
South Africa this time has been openly involved. For the first
time, they say that the African troops are there.''
   He said he was less able to see any quick resolution to the
fighting between the Angolan government and UNITA.

<HEAD>Pentagon Probes Alleged Northrop Overcharging on Stealth</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four current and former employees of Northrop
Corp. have filed a lawsuit accusing the aerospace giant of
overcharging the government by more than $1 billion for development
of the radar-dodging Stealth bomber.
   The Pentagon is investigating the allegations in the latest in a
series of inqueries involving alleged mishandling by Northrop of
military programs.
   The Stealth is Northrop's ``crown jewel,'' accounting for about
half of its net income and a third of its workforce.
   Last month, the Air Force confirmed it had awarded a $2 billion
contract to Northrop in the first infusion of regular production
funds for the plane. Only Northrop got a contract, despite
arguments by critics that the Air Force should seek a second source
for the planes because of Northrop's problems.
   In the 1990s, the Pentagon is expected to deploy 132 Stealth
bombers at a cost of $36.6 billion.
   The plane, designed to be difficult to detect on enemy radar, is
under development at Northrop's plants in Pico Rivera and Palmdale.
   The investigation by the Air Force and the Pentagon inspector
general's office was revealed Wednesday after a U.S. District Court
suit was filed by the one current and three former employees under
the federal False Claims Act.
   Under that act, citizens are allowed to sue on behalf of the
government and share in any damage award.
   The government must routinely investigate allegations in such
suit, and the Justice Department must decide within 60 days if
there is sufficient evidence for the government to join the suit or
seek its dismissal.
   Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio refused comment, citing company
policies against responding publicly to lawsuits and against making
statements regarding the super-secret Stealth bomber.
   The suit, which was sealed under procedures followed in such
cases, accuses Northrop of double-billing, false billing and
misrepresented charges, said Robert Kilborne, the attorney
representing the plaintiffs.
   Kilborne identified his clients only as an internal auditor, a
former controller, a former avionics engineer and a former test
equipment engineer.
   The suit alleges that Northrop destroyed internal audits that
turned up evidence of $400 million in improper charges on
development of the bomber, predicting that such overcharges may
actually total $1 billion.
   Wednesday's suit is the fourth such action brought by Kilborne
or his law partner, Herb Hafif, against Northrop. The other suits
involved Northrop's work on the MX missile program.
   In October, the Justice Department moved to dismiss one of the
earlier suits on grounds that there was insufficient evidence to
substantiate the allegations.

<TEXT>
   An off-duty police officer shot and killed a man
who challenged him to fire and reached for a knife Thursday, police
said, bringing to six the number of people who have died in Dallas
police shootings in less than two months.
   The shootings have exacerbated racial tensions in Dallas. Two of
the police department's most vocal critics are black members of the
City Council, who contend department's deadly force policy hurts
minorities.
   Both the officer and the slain man in Thursday's shooting were
black.
   According to police, the man ordered to waitresses to empty a
restaurant cash register, and was confronted bu Officer Cloyce
Addison Shannon.
   ``Go ahead and shoot me; shoot me,'' the man told Shannon as he
reached for a weapon tucked in his weapon, police reports said.
   Shannon, 29, shot the man twice in the chest. He was pronounced
dead at the scene, Police Lt. Ron Waldrop said.
   The officer was under the impression that the weapon was a gun,
but it turned out to be a long-bladed knife with a handle similar
to that of a pistol, Waldrop said.
   The Dallas County Medical Examiner's office identified the
victim as Robert Keith Johnson, 30, of Dallas.
   Six people have died in five shootings involving Dallas police
this year, including a black transient slain by off-duty police
after he killed a white officer in a downtown parking lot as some
members of a street-corner crowd cheered him on.
   The department has come under fire for its use of deadly force
and has been criticized as being out of touch with the minority
community.
   Police Capt. Rick Stone, who helped write the department's
deadly force policy, said the use of such force is limited to the
defense of life.
   ``Officers are prevented from firing warning shots and are
prevented from using deadly force to protect property interests
alone,'' he said. ``In essence, the officer must feel that either
he or another individual is in imminent danger of death or serious
bodily injury.''
   Police Chief Billy Prince, who issued no statement on latest
shooting, was criticized by city officials last month for blaming
the death of Officer John Chase on council members. Prince said
some members' criticism of the department created an environment of
potential violence.
   Price was criticized again Wednesday by Mayor Annette Strauss
and City Manager Richard Knight for comments concerning the
department's affirmative action program, implemented following
Chase's death.
   Prince said the new policy forced him to promote a black officer
who had scored one point lower on a civil rights exam than three
white candidates.
   Fueling the racially tense atmosphere were plans by the Ku Klux
Klan to march Saturday.
   ``The KKK is abhorrent to the Dallas Police Department,'' Prince
said in a statement. ``We did not solicit and do not want their
support.
   ``We regret the organization's plans to demonstrate in Dallas
Saturday and strongly urge them to abandon the planned
demonstration.''
   In the other police shootings this year, officer James Joe was
shot while off-duty as he investigating a burglary at the apartment
complex where he lived.
   The other two victims were shot by police last week. One was
black and one was white.

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sudden change of currency to
combat runaway inflation, accomplished largely by lopping zeros off
the old one, has caused confusion, shortages of staples and some
cheating.
   ``We are in a horrible crisis,'' said Julia Duarte, a fruit
vendor at the open-air Eastern Market in Managua. ``We don't have
rice, beans, and people are going hungry.''
   President Daniel Ortega, citing a yearly inflation rate of 1,500
percent, announced Feb. 14 that the cordoba currency was being
revalued at 10 to the dollar. At that time a dollar was worth
20,000 cordobas on the legal rate and 50,000 on the black market.
   His government said the new currency would end the black market,
foil a CIA plan to flood the country with the old money, and
deprive the U.S.-supported Contra rebels of Nicaraguan bills
supplied by the CIA.
   After Ortega announced the change, the opposition Private
Enterprise Council predicted it would drive real prices higher.
   The black market has continued, despite threats that
participants would be arrested, and the Contras claimed they got $1
million worth of the new money by downing a Sandinista helicopter
carrying the cash.
   Store owners said they were bewildered by the change in money
and many closed for several days. Rice and beans, staples for
Nicaraguans, disappeared from store shelves.
   The Intercontinental Hotel, unsure of how the new system worked,
charged $46 for breakfast, and $16 for a chicken sandwich.
   Nicaraguans had three days to trade their old money for new.
Those who were out of the country or otherwise missed the deadline
found the old bills worthless.
   Prices set by the government have increased sharply in objective
terms. On a dollar scale, a dozen eggs went from just under $1 to
$2.50, an average restaurant meal featuring beef went from under
$10 to $25, and gasoline rose from about 60 cents a gallon to $1.50.
   A new scale set monthly wages from $50 to $753. At a store
recently, the cost of a shirt was $33 and jeans were marked at the
equivalent of $66.
   La Prensa, the opposition newspaper La Prensa said in an
editorial that the daily wage in 1979, when the cordoba was last
valued at 10 to the dollar, was $15.20 and now it is $16.66. It
also noted that meat cost $7.22 a pound then and is $35 now.
   The leftist Sandinistas overthrew President Anastasio Somoza in
July 1979, ending a family dynasty that had been in power 42 years.
   A few days after the currency change, police swept through the
Eastern Market, broke some wooden stalls with clubs and confiscated
goods sold by vendors operating without licenses.
   The government said more than 3,000 vendors at the market had
been operating illegally.
   ``The police come, they push out some of the vendors, and they
take and resell the stuff,'' said Mrs. Duarte, 60, sitting in front
of large straw baskets filled with golden mangos and green oranges.
   ``We have to work harder than ever,'' said a nearby vegetable
vendor, Miguel Sanchez Sales. ``This new money isn't worth anything
either. We used to eat on 10 cordobas a day. Now we're lucky if we
can get by on 100.''

<TEXT>
   A request from columnist Jack Anderson's
associate to Cabinet officers to tell all about Vice President
George Bush got a brusque reply Thursday from Secretary of
Education William J. Bennett.
   Dale Van Atta, co-author of the Anderson column, wrote all 34
present and former Reagan Cabinet members who have served with
Bush, asking them to rate him as presidential timber.
   Calling Bush ``a mystery to the voters,'' the columnist asked
for instances where Bush influenced policy decisions or actions,
and warned that a failure to reply ``may send a negative message
about Mr. Bush.''
   Bennett's wrote back that it was ``nonsense'' to call Bush a
mystery to the voters. He also said he would not violate the
confidentiality of Cabinet discussions, or ``the president's
injunction to all his Cabinet members to stay neutral in the
presidential race.''
   ``Finally, and most incredibly, you threaten that you will
construe a refusal to accede to your demands as sending `a negative
message about Mr. Bush.' I cannot believe anyone will credit such a
perverse interpretation,'' said Bennett.
   ``I am confident that the American people will judge the vice
president's distinguished record of public service on its merits.''
   Bush has said repeatedly on the campaign trail that he wants to
be known as ``the education president.'' Bennett has been mentioned
as a possible running mate for whoever wins the Republican
nomination.

<HEAD>Poor Readers Getting Shortchanged in U.S. Schools, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American schools are still having trouble
trying to make good readers out of poor ones, according to a
federal released Thursday.
   The report from the government-backed testing program, the
National Assessment of Education Progress, said poor readers are
left at a disadvantage by teachers who help them figure out hard
words but neglect to make them discuss the meaning of the entire
passage.
   ``American schools continue to have difficulty in narrowing the
performance gap between better and poorer readers as they progress
through school,'' said the report, ``Who Reads Best?'' The study
was based on an analysis of reading tests the National Assessment
gave 35,000 students ages 9, 13 and 17 in 1986.
   The National Assessment, run under a federal contract by the
Educational Testing Service, refrained from making any comparisons
between these test results and such assessments of reading in 1984
and earlier.
   ETS officials revealed last month there were sharp, unexplained
declines in reading scores among the 9- and 17-year-olds in 1986.
They suspect something went wrong in the test itself, not the
students' performance.
   There were no sharp declines in other subjects tested in 1986,
they noted.
   The new report said there is still no explanation for the
``precipitous declines'' in reading, which it called ``simply not
believable.''
   The National Assessment switched to a different scale to report
the 1986 test results. But officials expressed complete confidence
in the conclusions reached in ``Who Reads Best?''
   The report suggests teachers use the same ``thought-stretching
activities'' for poor readers that they routinely employ with
better readers.
   Students had ``particular difficulty with tasks that require
them to elaborate upon or defend their evaluations and
interpretations of what they have read,'' it said.
   ``Poor readers report doing less independent reading than good
readers,'' it said. ``Poor readers report that their teachers use a
narrower range of (instructional) approaches than are used with
better readers.''
   They focus more on decoding strategies than comprehension and
critical thinking, it said.
   ``In the elementary grades, teachers of better readers are more
likely to preview reading material and read new parts aloud to the
class _ both activities which emphasize the meaning of the
selection,'' it said.
   ``At the high school level, better readers reported more
previewing of material, while poorer readers indicated their
teachers more frequently pointed out the hard words and read new
parts aloud.''
   Younger students and those in the bottom quarter of reading
scores generally were exposed to fewer instructional strategies,
while older students and those in the top 25 percent reported
engaging ``in more before-and after-reading activities.''
   They were ``more likely to be asked to engage in
thought-stretching activities after they have finished their
reading of the text,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
   The president on Thursday ordered the
removal of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, the Panamanian strongman
who has been accused of illicit activities and indicted in the
United States on drug trafficking charges.
   In a nationally broadcast message, Delvalle said he had asked
Noriega several days ago to step down voluntarily so that an
investigation of charges of illicit activities could be launched.
He said the general declined.
   ``There is no other alternative but the use of the powers that
the constitution gives me, to separate General Noriega from his
high command and to encharge the leadership of the institution to
the current chief of staff, Col. Marcos Justine,'' Delvalle said.
   There was no immediate indication of whether Noriega would
comply with the order or if it would be carried out by his officers.
   The military has long been regarded as the real power in Panama,
with its chief considered the de facto ruler of the country.
   The Reagan administration has been calling on Noriega to step
down since his indictment by a federal grand jury in Miami on drug
trafficking charges on Feb. 5. The two indictments portrayed
Noriega as a key member of an international drug trafficking
conspiracy.
   Demonstrations against Noriega broke out in Panama last June
after the military chief's recently retired second in command
publicly charged the general with illicit activities ranging from
drug trafficking to electoral fraud and the assassination of a
political opponent. The military chief said he was innocent.
   Delvalle talked to U.S. authorities last Wednesday at an
unannounced meeting in Miami.
   Reagan administration officials said they received discreet
inquiries about U.S. willingness to drop federal drug charges
against Noriega.
   In his speech Thursday, Delvalle said: ``Panama currently is
experiencing one of the most difficult and dangerous moments of its
history.''
   He added that he reached his decision because of the ``immense
seriousness'' of the situation and ``the fruitlessness of my
efforts.''
   Delvalle said he ordered Noriega out as chief of the Defense
Forces of Panama ``to allow justice to continue an impartial course
without pressures of any kind.''
   Delvalle was inaugurated in September 1985 after elected
President Nicolas Ardito Barletta resigned in a dispute with
Noriega. Delvalle previously was a little known civilian who had
run for first vice president on the official party ticket.
   Ardito Barletta had been the first elected civilian president to
take office in Panama in 16 years, although the 1984 vote was
marred by charges of vote fraud engineered by the military.
   Noriega and his supporters have said those criticizing the
military leader are trying to break the Panama Canal treaty, under
which the United States agreed to cede control of the canal on Dec.
31, 1999.
   Noriega has recently criticized the U.S. Southern Command,
headquarters for all U.S. military activities in Latin America.
   The Pentagon and the White House interpreted his remarks as a
call for the transfer of the 10,000 servicemen and their 20,000
dependents from Panamanian soil.
   Washington rejected such a move, saying the American troops were
legally in the country and would remain in Panama to protect the
canal until it is handed over to Panama.
   In Washington, a Pentagon spokeswoman said Thursday that the
U.S. Southern Command had not been put on any type of alert as a
result of Delvalle's action.
   ``Everything is normal,'' said Capt. Nancy LaLuntas, the
spokeswoman. ``They might be advising (personnel) to avoid
demonstrations, but the command is on normal status at the moment.''
   Noriega attended a military college in Peru on a scholarship,
then entered the Panamanian National Guard in 1962 as a lieutenant.
He quickly became acquainted with a rising young officer named Omar
Torrijos.
   Torrijos took power in Panama in a 1968 coup and less than a
year later named Noriega, then an obscure major in charge of the
country's northernmost province, as his chief of intelligence with
the rank of lieutenant colonel.
   The job put Noriega in touch with U.S. intelligence agencies
interested in any potential threats to the security of the Panama
Canal, a vital shipping link between the Atlantic and Pacific
oceans.
   When Torrijos died in an unexplained airplane crash in 1981,
Noriega was well placed to shoulder his way to the top command
ahead of several more senior officers. He took power in 1983.
   During his birthday speech earlier this month, Noriega declared:
``If they want me out, they'll have to kill me.''

   Pat Robertson defended himself against
President Reagan's critical comments Thursday, saying his Christian
Broadcasting Network did give the administration information on
American hostages in 1985. Robertson said he mentioned it Wednesday
merely as ``a throwaway line.''
   Reacting to Reagan's public skepticism, Robertson said at a
Louisville campaign stop, ``I wasn't meaning to start some major
confrontation with a person I admire tremendously, but obviously
the State Department must have dismissed what we had to say, or
else they didn't refer it up the line to the president.''
   Later, at a stop in Birmingham, Ala., Robertson said of his
statements about having known the hostages whereabouts, ``I used
that as a throwaway line'' to illustrate that the nation needed to
improve its methods of dealing with terrorists.
   He said it was ``hard to understand why there has been such an
incredible flap.''
   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said she had no
immediate response to Robertson's newest comments about having
giving information to the department but would look into the matter
further.
   Reagan, during his nationally broadcast news conference
Wednesday night, questioned Robertson's contentions that in 1985 he
had known the whereabouts of hostages in the Middle East ``where
they could have been rescued.''
   ``It'd be very strange if he actually did have information as to
the location of those hostages,'' Reagan said. ``Isn't it strange
that no one in our administration was ever apprised of that?''
   ``If he thought that he knew, he kept it to himself,'' Reagan
added.
   Robertson, campaigning in Louisville on Thursday, complained
that what he had said about the hostages ``was, I'm afraid,
misinterpreted.''
   In Atlanta on Wednesday, the Republican presidential candidate
had said, ``We identified in our news department at CBN the
location of those hostages in Lebanon very shortly after they were
taken, and they were in a position where they could have been
rescued. They were in Beirut, and they could have been freed.''
   Robertson did not say which hostages he was talking about.
   Nine Americans are in captivity in Lebanon, including Marine Lt.
Col. William R. Higgins, who was captured last week. Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
is the longest-held captive; he was kidnapped on March 16, 1985.
   A CBN spokesman, Benton Miller, later said the former television
evangelist's comments pertained to hostages who had been taken from
TWA Flight 847 in Beirut in June 1985.
   One passenger, Navy diver Robert Stethem, was killed after the
plane was hijacked. The passengers kept as hostages after the plane
landed in Beirut were later released.
   ``The State Department, from what my staff tells me, did inquire
of us concerning what knowledge we had of that TWA hijacking,''
Robertson said Thursday. ``Our reporter did identify the names of
the captors and identified them as being close to Nabih Berri and
what is called Hezbollah.''
   ``We knew the captors and we had the basic area of Beirut where
they were being held,'' he said.
   A State Department expert on terrorism has said such information
probably would not be enough to mount a rescue effort.
   Robertson's comments on Wednesday were criticized by two of his
Republican presidential rivals, Vice President George Bush and Rep.
Jack Kemp of New York.
   Bush, said, ``My question would be, how come he didn't get hold
of the proper authorities in the United States government that were
working day and night, trying to figure out how they could get

   Kemp, in a statement, called Robertson's statements
irresponsible and said he should ``apologize to the families of the
hostages whom he has needlessly hurt in an attempt to gain
publicity.''

   While Jimmy Swaggart contends with the fallout
from his self-confessed moral lapse, his ministry is battling
litigation involving taxes on a church radio station and
allegations he skimmed ministry profits.
   One case concerns the tax status of the station, KJOJ-FM in
Shenandoah. The Louisiana-based ministry sued county authorities
over their denial of a tax exemption for the station, which the
ministry contends is a place of worship.
   In two other cases, city and school authorities are seeking more
than $130,000 in delinquent taxes and other claims involving the
Christian station.
   An attorney for the ministry, James W. Bradford Jr., did not
immediately return telephone calls Thursday.
   Russell R. Graham, an attorney for the Montgomery County
Appraisal District, said the station does not meet the legal
definition of a place of worship. The agency denied the station
tax-exempt status in 1982.
   He said the agency's defense in the ministry lawsuit had been
hampered by the ministry's reluctance to reveal financial
information. But he said the county has received ``considerable
cooperation'' from the ministry since the county agreed to a
judge's order in July sealing further filings in the case until the
April 4 trial.
   In motions filed last year, the ministry revealed it collected
$455.8 million in contributions and sales of religious materials
from 1979 to 1985. Contributions rose about 25 percent annually
since 1979, financial statements show.
   The ministry had claimed the operation did not make a profit,
but a 1982 financial statement showed $11.9 million classified as
``excess revenues'' after expenses.
   Graham, in a letter to the judge obtained last year by The Texas
Lawyer magazine, had complained that the ministry would not provide
detailed accounting of millions of dollars in ``excess profits.''
   Tax officials ``believe that further discovery will reflect that
Jimmy Swaggart retained these funds for his personal use,'' the
letter said.
   ``The Texas statute on exemptions provides that not only does
the use of the property have to fit the narrow definition of what
is exempt, but you have to use income for accepted purposes under
the statute and avoid a situation where anyone receives any private
gain,'' Graham said.
   Ministry lawyers have denied that Swaggart skimmed ministry
profits.
   Hinging on the outcome of the Montgomery County suit are tax
cases against the ministry by the city of Shenandoah, set for a
March 21 trial, and by the Conroe Independent School District, for
which no trial date has been set.
   Shenandoah claims the ministry owes nearly $60,000 on the
station from 1980-87 and on its equipment from 1981-87, city
attorney Michael J. Darlow said.
   The school district claims it is owed more than $70,000 in back
taxes from the radio station, its contents and a broadcast tower,
said school attorney Robert A. Mott.

<HEAD>Senate Snarled in Debate Over Bill To Halt Big Campaign Spending</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The legislation that has snarled the Senate in
a filibuster is a Democratic response to the escalating cost of
getting elected to Congress.
   The bill, being pushed heavily by the self-described citizens
lobby, Common Cause, has 52 co-sponsors, all of whom are Democrats
except Robert Stafford, R-Vt., and John Chafee, R-R.I.
   It would set up a system to encourage Senate candidates in
general elections to voluntarily observe spending limits ranging
from $950,000 to $5.5 million, depending on a state's population.
   In 1986, the average cost of winning a Senate seat was $3
million, a fivefold increase from 1976. In larger states, the cost
in 1986 often exceeded $10 million.
   Under the Democrats' plan, a candidate observing the state
spending limit would be allowed to put no more than $20,000 in
personal funds into the campaign.
   In an effort to curb the growing role of political action
committees as a source of campaign money, a participating candidate
could get no more than 20 percent of his or her money from PACs. In
1986, PACs provided more than half the money spent by more than 200
House and Senate candidates.
   A candidate observing the limit would be eligible for campaign
money from the Treasury if an opponent did not adhere to the limit.
Tax dollars also would be awarded in cases in which a participating
candidate was the target of heavy spending by independent groups.
   A participating candidate also would be eligible for reduced
mailing rates. The bill would require radio and television stations
to charge the candidate the ``lowest unit rates'' for advertising.
   Campaign ads by candidates not observing spending limits would
have to carry the disclaimer, ``This candidate has not agreed to
abide by voluntary spending limits.''

<HEAD>High Pressure Produces Mostly Sunny Skies Across Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of the nation enjoyed mostly sunny skies Thursday thanks to
a large high-pressure zone, while snow fell over parts of the
Midwest and New York state.
   The snow, ranging from flurries to major accumulation, fell from
lower Michigan across the eastern Great Lakes to upstate New York,
with heavier snow squalls near Lakes Erie and Ontario.
   Up to 17 inches was dumped on Pulaski, N.Y., overnight Thursday,
and up to 8 inches fell at Oswego, N.Y., between midnight and 7
a.m. EST.
   Three to 5 inches of snow fell Thursday morning in Ohio's Geauga
and Lake counties, while 2 to 3 inches covered downtown Cleveland.
   Light rain fell in northwest Washington state, and a trace of
rain fell in parts of the Texas Rio Grande Valley.
   Temperatures remained low in the Northeast, with midday readings
mostly in the teens and 20s from the upper Mississippi Valley
across the Great Lakes and northern sections of the Ohio Valley to
the northern and central Appalachians. Winds of 10 to 20 mph
produced wind chills in the single digits as far south as
Bluefield, W.V.
   Temperatures warmed into the 60s, 70s and 80s across the desert
Southwest. Readings in the 60s were also common across the southern
Plains, Louisiana and southern and central Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 14 at
Gunnison, Colo., to 87 at Palm Springs, Calif. The early-morning
low for the nation was 18 below zero at Gunnison.
   For Friday, sunny skies again were expected across most of the
country, while snow was forecast across the Great Lakes region and
scattered snowshowers over the central Appalachians and northern
Maine. Light rain was expected along the northern Pacific Coast,
while clouds should increase across southern Texas. Much of the
nation will have highs in the 40s or 50s. Highs will be in the 20s
and 30s from eastern North Dakota across the Great Lakes region and
the upper Ohio Valley to the northern two-thirds of the Atlantic
Coast. Temperatures will reach the 60s and 70s over the southern
tier of states as well as over Arkansas, Oklahoma, Kansas, western
Nebraska and parts of Nevada, with readings in the 80s over
portions of the desert Southwest.

   Albania said Wednesday it was
breaking out of its isolationist shell to build better relations
with its neighbors, but bitter differences between Turkey and
Bulgaria showed the region is still rife with disputes.
   Albania's presence at a three-day conference of six Balkan
states was its first appearance at a regional forum after a decade
of spurning invitations to attend low-level Balkan gatherings.
   ``Development of relations with neighboring countries
constitutes one of the priorities of the foreign policy'' of
Albania, Foreign Minister Reis Malile told his counterparts from
Greece, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Romania and Bulgaria.
   ``Not only do we not hesitate to cooperate with others. On the
contrary, we want this cooperation and consider it a factor which
contributes to our internal development,'' he said.
   But the conference, the first high-level gathering of Balkan
nations since World War II, was marked by Turkey's indirect
denunciation of Bulgaria's treatment of its Turkish minority.
   ``Attempts to alter the cultural and religious identity of
ethnic minorities can neither be reconciled nor coexist with the
new beginning we all seem desirous to make here in Belgrade,'' said
Turkish Foreign Minister Mesut Yilmaz
   Relations among most Balkan countries are still strained by
bilateral quarrels over ethnic minorities that date back to the
late 19th century when much of the region belonged to the Ottoman
Empire.
   Yilmaz did not assail Bulgaria by name nor mention its estimated
one million ethnic Turks specifically, but the minority issue is
the primary point of contention between the two countries.
   A campaign forcing Turkish citizens to change their names was
begun in 1984. It was first reported by Turkish newspapers and
later confirmed by Western diplomats in Sofia and by the human
rights group, Amnesty International.
   Bulgarian authorities, who have so far denied the existence of a
self-contained Turkish minority, said the decision to adopt
Bulgarian names was voluntary and no pressure was exerted.
   The Turkish foreign minister's comments were expected to be
cause tension during the three-day meeting.
   He expressed his satisfaction about the ``common understanding''
he reached with his Bulgrian counterpart Peter Mladenov in signing
an agreement Tuesday that he said would establish a mechanism for
the settlement of the existing problems between the two countries.
   But Yilmaz added that ``anachronistic policies cannot be either
defended or ignored,'' a reference to Bulgaria's policy toward the
ethnic Turks.
   Asked to comment on Yilmaz' speech, Mladenov said he would
comment on it only after reading it.
   A member of Turkish delegation, asked why the Turkish foreign
minister decided to criticize Bulgaria even after the protocol was
signed, said: ``We are seeking a mechanism to solve our problem.
But we have yet to see whether it will work.''

   Jesse Jackson mined for votes in eastern
Kentucky coal country Thursday, the first Democratic presidential
candidate since 1968 to campaign in this area where he said the
land is rich but the people are poor.
   Jackson visited a strip mine site near Hazard, then went to a
rally that drew about 3,000 people.
   ``Right down here in Appalachia, the land is wealthy _ the
people are poor,'' Jackson told a crowd in the Hazard Memorial
Gymnasium.
   Jackson, campaigning for support in Kentucky's March 8
Democratic presidential primary, said miners, farmers and factory
workers must forge a coalition to battle abuses of large
corporations which he said pay few taxes and hold down wages.
   Jackson drew the most applause when he discussed coal-related
issues. It is unfair, he said, when big coal companies pay almost
no taxes. He also said: ``What good is land if it is stripped from
beneath your feet?''
   Earlier, in Louisville, Jackson stressed his Southern roots and
his record. ``I return to the South as a son of the South,''
Jackson said.
   ``I have given 25 years of national and international service,''
Jackson said. ``My track record on national service is more
substantial than my opponents. I know foreign policy better than my
competitors.''
   Jackson, a Baptist minister, addressed the 44th annual Black
Baptist Pastors' Conference in Louisville before flying to Eastern
Kentucky.
   No other Democratic presidential candidates have ventured into
eastern Kentucky this year _ or in any year since Robert F. Kennedy
made a campaign trip to the Kentucky mountains in 1968.
   
   In Louisville, Jackson said his Southern credentials and
campaign message will carry him through the Super Tuesday primary
March 8.
   ``I return to the South as a son of the South,'' said Jackson,
who was born in South Carolina. ``I helped make the new South
better 25 years ago, and now I want to make it even better by
focusing on the agenda of today.''
   Jackson said that agenda includes improving day care, attaining
equal rights for women, increasing the minimum wage, increasing aid
to education and stopping a loss of jobs.
   ``We must care about the family and working people,'' he said.
``We can't be a great nation if we abandon those whose shoulders we
stand on.''
   Asked about his chances on Super Tuesday _ when Democrats go to
the primaries and caucuses in 20 states and American Samoa _ and,
in particular, about how he will do in the balloting in Kentucky,
Jackson said:
   ``I'm not projecting a certain number. Those who support me feel
I can win. I know I can win.''
   Jackson, who carried Louisville and Lexington in 1984 Democratic
caucuses, made a plug for campaign contributions in his address to
the ministers.
   He later discounted claims that a lack of money will keep him
from waging an effective campaign.
   ``I cannot buy the nomination. I will outwork my opposition,''
Jackson said. ``I come to the South with a message and a track
record, not money and television commercials.''

<TEXT>
   CBS and Pat Sajak insist they won't be gunning
for NBC's ``The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson'' when their
new talk show premieres next January, despite its time period
opposite the late-night king.
   CBS made a formal announcement of the signing of Sajak,
well-known as the host of ``Wheel of Fortune,'' at a news
conference Wednesday.
   CBS Entertainment President Kim LeMasters said the show would be
90 minutes instead of Carson's hour and would premiere on Jan. 9,
1989.
   ``There is no attempt on our part here to compete with Johnny
Carson,'' LeMasters said. ``Mr. Carson is a tradition, he is
much-beloved and a brilliant performer in what he does, and that's
not our aim. Our aim is that the environment in late night can
stand more than just one talk-show format.''
   ``If you're going to do a late-night show, that's a fact of
life, that Mr. Carson is going to be there. We can't worry about
that. We have to worry about doing the best show we can,'' said
Sajak.
   Carson, who has been host of ``The Tonight Show'' for a
quarter-century, last year signed only a two-year extension of his
contract with NBC, but both Sajak and LeMasters said they did not
plan on Carson retiring.
   ``I have been hearing Johnny Carson is retiring for literally 20
years,'' said Sajak. ``It wouldn't shock me to be having the same
conversation in 10 years, that Johnny Carson is retiring in a
couple of years.''
   There's no name yet for the new show yet, though Sajak joked,
``We're thinking of the Wilton South Show,'' a reference to the
quickly canceled Fox late-night show ``The Wilton North Report.''
He added, ``perhaps the name Pat will be in the title.''
   Sajak will continue as host of the syndicated nighttime version
of ``Wheel of Fortune,'' which is the No. 1 syndicated show. His
contract for the NBC daytime version of the show expires in
December.
   LeMasters said CBS would have launched a talk show years ago
``if we'd had the personality.'' He said the network chose Sajak
because ``we were looking for someone intelligent, which Pat is,
well-read and with the ability to attract guests. And he's cute.''
   LeMasters said CBS might put its current schedule of late-night
original dramas, ``Adderly'' and ``Night Heat,'' in the 1 a.m. time
period instead of canceling them.

<HEAD>Kissinger Calls For More Effective West European Alliance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
called on the European members of the NATO alliance Wednesday to
unify their military defenses against the Soviet Union and to
coordinate British and French nuclear forces as an important first
step.
   Kissinger also suggested that Western Europe and the United
States present Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev with a
comprehensive plan to reduce nuclear and conventional arms
simultaneously.
   ``I am convinced that he has the intelligence and the
imagination to make an intelligent response,'' Kissinger told the
Senate Armed Services Committee. ``And if he refused, we would at
least understand the nature of the challenge better than we do
now.''
   Kissinger said the Western alliance will work better if Europe
sheds much of its military dependence on the United States and
develops ``a capacity for independent action'' based on ``a
rational balance of responsibilities.''
   As it stands now, he said, the 16 European members of NATO often
go along with U.S. military decisions for lack of a better
alternative. The result is not consultation or a mutual
decision-making process but merely a U.S. ``briefing'' on already
decided U.S. actions.
   Under conditions of relative prosperity, Kissinger said,
Europe's military dependence on the United States ``can breed
guilt, self-hatred and a compulsion to display independence of the
senior partner whenever doing so is safe, especially with regard to
Third World issues, the Middle East and some aspects of East-West
relations.''
   For those reasons, he said, the United States has a positive
interest in encouraging the evolution of a more independent
European voice in defense matters.
   Kissinger said that while some fear that military independence
might weaken Europe's military ties to the United States, ``the
opposite is almost certainly the case.''
   ``There is no foreseeable East-West conflict in which Europe
will not be better off with American support,'' Kissinger said.
   ``This is why, if the British and the French can agree on
coordinating their nuclear forces, the United States should
encourage it as an important first step toward a greater European
role in a joint nuclear defense,'' he said.
   ``Above all, the United States should make clear that European
union on defense matters will be viewed as strengthening, not
weakening Atlantic ties,'' he said.
   A European military union, he asserted, would ease West
Germany's fears of isolation and help overcome a ``logistical
nightmare'' caused by the effort of each European nation to
``stretch already inadequate defense efforts across the whole
panoply of weapons.''
   Kissinger said that divisive trends within the alliance have
been magnified by the successful ratification of the new treaty
eliminating medium-range U.S. and Soviet nuclear-armed missiles in
Europe and elsewhere.
   He repeated recent statements that the treaty strains the
alliance by making the nuclear defense of Europe dependent largely
on nuclear weapons located not in Europe but in the United States
or on submarines at sea.
   ``Many Europeans are convinced a gap is being created that in
time will enable the Soviet Union to threaten Europe while sparring
with the United States,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   More than 100 ungraded results from an
upper-level law exam were accidentally shredded, leaving Washington
University officials with red faces and some students furious.
   ``It seemed to be just a matter of time before a huge
administrative error occurred,'' Maia Brodie, a third-year law
student and president of the Student Bar Association, said of the
shredding, which was revealed last week. ``Some students want their
money back, they're so furious.''
   School officials said a student working without supervision in
the registrar's office accidentally shredded both the questions and
answers to a three-hour exam that was given in December.
   The exam was to provide the sole basis for the grades of 116
students who were enrolled in the evidence course.
   The shredding occurred two weeks ago. Law School Dean Dorsey D.
Ellis Jr. gave the bad news to the class in a memorandum dated Feb.
16.
   School officials decided to give each student in the evidence
class a ``credit'' that will have no bearing on grade-point
averages.
   One student studied nearly full-time for five weeks in hopes of
raising her grade-point average through the exam, she said.
Moreover, minor differences in grade averages can ``make the
difference between a $26,000 job and a $40,000 job,'' Brodie said.

<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A weary Senate ended 53 hours of continuous
and sometimes cantankerous debate over campaign finance Thursday,
leaving Democrats no closer to victory than when the filibuster
began Tuesday.
   By agreement between majority Democrats and stubborn
Republicans, the talking stopped about 7 p.m., setting up a Friday
vote on a Democratic cloture motion to force a vote on their
campaign legislation.
   Democrats have the votes to pass the bill, but they had
virtually no hope of mustering the 60 needed to win Friday's
cloture roll call. The expected loss could scuttle the divisive
issue for the 100th Congress.
   As the filibuster wound down, Majority Leader Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., made a final pitch for voluntary spending limits to
counter the escalating cost of getting elected, with increasing
amounts of money coming from special-interest political action
committees.
   ``The Senate should not be owned by an aristocracy of money,''
Byrd said. ``Campaign reform gives the little guy an equal share.
... This business of the golden handshake _ nobody likes it.
Senators don't want to spend all their time going from fundraiser
to fundraiser with their hand out begging for money.''
   Another advocate of spending limits, Sen. David Boren, D-Okla.,
conceded that ``negotiations have fallen apart'' because of GOP
opposition to proposed voluntary spending limits on Senate
campaigns.
   ``Give us a chance!'' Boren shouted, urging his Republican foes
to join in shutting off debate and allowing a floor vote on the
campaign finance measure, which Democrats have the votes to win.
   Boren promised that if GOP senators switched sides and provided
the winning margin to invoke cloture, the Democratic bill would be
open to all ``legitimate, relevant'' amendments the Republicans
might propose to reach a compromise.
   But GOP senators made clear their fears that the spending limits
proposal disguises an attempt to reinforce the Democrats' election
advantage in large, heavily Democratic states and to perpetuate
their majority control of the Senate.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., called it the ``incumbent protection
act'' and said it would work against election challengers with
little name recognition or financial support.
   ``Everyone in politics knows that with these (spending) limits,
what we absolutely say to most challengers is, `you've had it,'''
Rudman said.
   ``We've heard a lot of accusations on this floor that this bill
is designed to end the Republican Party,'' Rudman said. ``I don't
believe that ... but to many of us on this side of the aisle it
kind of feels that way.''
   The Senate will vote at 10 a.m. Friday on whether to invoke
cloture, or halt further debate on the bill.
   The measure has 52 co-sponsors, more than the majority of 51
senators necessary for passage, but Democratic strategists say they
are still short of the 60 votes required to invoke cloture and
proceed to a floor vote on the bill itself.
   Byrd lost a record seven cloture votes on the bill last year,
and the lack of any significant weakening in GOP determination to
block the measure made it likely that Byrd would lose again Friday
morning.
   He hasn't said what would happen to the bill after the expected
cloture defeat, but Democratic aides said privately that it would
be shelved.
   Byrd, who once threatened to continue round-the-clock
filibustering through next week, relented Wednesday night and
announced agreement with the GOP leadership to end the talkathon
late Thursday afternoon.
   Byrd spokeswoman Linda Peek denied that the agreement
represented a Democratic defeat. ``The defeat is for the
Republicans who are consistently against the campaign spending
limits and are afraid to vote on the bill,'' she said.
   The measure calls for voluntary ceilings on Senate campaign
spending that range from $950,000 to $5.5 million, depending on a
state's population. Participating candidates would be eligible for
Treasury funds if their opponents exceed the limits or if
independent groups spend large amounts against a candidate
observing the restriction.
   The bill also would prohibit a participating candidate from
receiving more than 20 percent of campaign funds from
special-interest political action committees. In 1986, more than
200 House and Senate candidates _ most of them incumbents _
received more than half their campaign money from PACs.
   Republicans argued that spiraling campaign costs, rather than
spending, should be the primary issue.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said the only compromise he would
accept would be to allow candidates in individual states to agree
on their own spending limts. Rudman argued for reallocating
contributions under a formula that would allow 50 percent to come
from individuals, 30 percent from the political parties and 20
percent from PACs.
   The debate Thursday was much calmer than the day before, when
Republicans angrily denounced Byrd's successful motion to have the
Senate sergeant-at-arms, Henry K. Giugni, arrest absentee
Republicans and force them to return to the chamber.
   Under Giugni's direction, armed plainclothes Capitol police
broke into the locked offices of Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., and
carried him feet-first onto the Senate floor. Packwood's arrival
provided the 51st senator necessary to constitute a quorum or
majority of senators on the floor.
   Byrd hoped to embarrass the Republicans by focusing attention on
their stalling tactics, and without a quorum to keep the filibuster
alive, the Senate would have been forced to adjourn.
   Before he arrested Packwood, Giugni reportedly approached Sen.
Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., in the Russell Senate Office
Building. But Weicker, a large man known for his hot temper,
refused to submit and Giugni left without a protest.

   Afghanistan's Communist government
said Thursday a guerrilla proposal for an interim government while
Soviet troops withdraw was a ``hysterical'' dream, but a U.S. envoy
called it a good idea.
   Undersecretary of State Michael Armacost, visiting Pakistan,
said the plan announced this week by the seven-party guerrilla
alliance was a ``very welcome step toward the resolution of the
Afghan problem.''
   The alliance, led by Yunis Khalis and based in Pakistan,
proposes an executive council of all seven guerrilla leaders to
preside over a 28-member Cabinet of rebels, Afghan refugees and
``Moslems presently living in Kabul.''
   Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979 and
an estimated 115,000 now are in the country helping fight the
guerrillas.
   About 3.5 million Afghans have fled to neighboring Pakistan.
Most live in border cities and camps that serve as bases and supply
points for the guerrillas.
   Thursday's editions of the Afghan Communist Party newspaper Anis
said the plan ``resembles more a hysterical and disturbed dream,''
Kabul radio reported.
   ``It is clear that this void and unfounded plan has no
legitimacy and therefore is unacceptable,'' the paper said, adding
that the insurgent proposal was like the ``story of sharing the
wolf's prey.''
   The radio also broadcast a Foreign Ministry statement that
``there is only one legal government in Afghanistan, which has been
recognized by 80 countries in the world.''
   Armacost arrived Wednesday to discuss progress toward Soviet
withdrawal. He met with President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, and a U.S.
Embassy official said he also had ``frank and open'' discussions
with leaders of the Moslem guerrillas.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Feb. 8 that Soviet troops will start
pulling out May 15 if U.N.-sponsored talks in Geneva between
Afghanistan and Pakistan bring a settlement by March 15, and
complete the withdrawal in 10 months. The talks are to resume
Wednesday.
   Pakistan demands a military settlement be accompanied by a
political one to ensure transitional stability. Washington, which
supports the guerrillas, has devoted most of its effort to
obtaining a withdrawal.

<HEAD>Judge Signs Decree Ensuring Hospital Duties For Doctor With AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A doctor with AIDS once ordered to stay away from
patients at Cook County Hospital was guaranteed full medical duties
under an agreement approved Wednesday by a federal judge.
   The consent decree signed by U.S. District Judge John A.
Nordberg ensures that the neurologist will be able to examine
patients, draw blood, perform spinal taps and handle other
procedures included in his speciality.
   The Cook County Board restored most of those duties last
September after the doctor filed a lawsuit, but Nordberg had
suggested the board could again reverse itself and asked for a
formal agreement between the doctor and hospital.
   A year ago, the board, which governs the hospital, barred any
contact between patients and the doctor.
   In July, the board said the doctor could see patients, but could
not puncture the skin or come in contact with body fluids of
patients.
   The American Civil Liberties Union, acting on behalf of the
doctor, filed a lawsuit a month later seeking the return of full
medical responsibilities for him.
   ``We're all gratified that the Cook County Hospital has agreed
to follow medical evidence that a doctor with AIDS can continue to
practice,'' said ACLU attorney Ben Wolf of the agreement worked out
between the ACLU, the hospital and the board.
   ``He will follow Centers for Disease Control guidelines, which
require gloves when certain procedures are performed,'' Wolf said.
``He has even agreed to wear double gloves in certain instances.''
   Wolf said complications from AIDS have caused the doctor to miss
some days of work.
   ``When his health permits, he's practicing. He's had some tough
times,'' the attorney said.
   A spokeswoman for the hospital, Wanda Robertson, forwarded all
calls to hospital Director Terrence M. Hansen, who did not return
messages requesting comment.
   Under the decree, the doctor is not required to tell patients he
has AIDS, Wolf said.
   The decree said the doctor would not perform muscle biopsies or
cerebral work, but not because he has the fatal disease.
Neurologists have not handled those procedures in years, Wolf said.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, destroys the
body's defenses against disease, leaving a person prey to
life-threatening infections and certain cancers.
   The virus that causes the incurable and fatal disease is
believed to be passed mainly through sexual intercourse, shared
hypodermic needles and from infected mothers to their infants
before or during birth.

<TEXT>
   NASA chief James Fletcher said Wednesday that
the civil space program is the key to questions ``about where this
civilization is going'' and should not be allowed to suffer from
the shortsightedness of ``naysayers.''
   ``We need to adopt a rigorous space agenda beyond the 1990s and
stick to it,'' Fletcher said in a speech before the National Space
Club.
   He said American technological leadership will ride on the
consistent and longterm national support for the space policy
recently announced by President Reagan.
   ``The stakes are very high,'' Fletcher said. ``The Soviets have
let it be known that they are in space to stay. .... Leadership (in
space) is not just who is ahead, but is a sustained and consistent
effort toward goals over a long period of time.''
   He said Reagan's space policy affirms the nation's commitment to
the space station and to human exploration beyond Earth orbit, such
as to Mars. The policy is supported in the president's budget
presented last week to Congress.
   ``The program presented to Congress is the right policy at the
right time,'' Fletcher said. ``We now need to rally national
support to it through the various congressional hurdles.''
   ``The civil space program is key to the much larger questions
about where this civilization is going,'' he said. ``We can't let
the program founder through shortsightedness.''
   The NASA administrator cautioned that some oppose the space
program and that public support is needed to overcome these
objections.
   ``It's surprising how many naysayers there are in and out of
Congress,'' he said. ``We have to guard against the naysayers.''
   The National Space Club is an organization of industrial,
military, congressional and governmental supporters of the U.S.
efforts in space and rocketry.

   Armenians demanding annexation of part of a
neighboring republic massed by the thousands in two cities
Thursday, and Red Army troops and tanks were sent into one area as
a show of force, witnesses said.
   A senior official was quoted as saying there were ``human
victims'' of the unrest.
   Demonstrations in the Armenian capital of Yerevan appeared to be
the largest unsanctioned gatherings in Soviet history, according to
eyewitness accounts. Some witnesses said more than 1 million people
participated in protests and strikes. There was no official
estimate of the numbers.
   The demonstrators were demanding that the Nagorno-Karabakh
region, now part of the republic of Azerbaidzhan, be annexed to
Armenia.
   In addition to the territorial dispute involving the
1,760-square-mile autonomous region in the Caucusus Mountains, the
people are divided by religion. Armenians are predominantly
Christians, and most Azeris, the dominant ethnic group in
Azerbaidzhan, are Shiite Moslem.
   A non-voting member of the ruling Politburo, Vladimir I.
Dolgikh, said in a television broadcast Wednesday night from
Yerevan that there were ``human victims'' of the unrest, according
to an Armenian telephone operator in Yerevan.
   The operator said Dolgikh did not provide details.
   An Armenian nationalist activist said he heard rumors that
Azeris had stoned a bus in Nagorno-Karabakh, killing an
undetermined number of Armenians. The activist, Mofses Gorgisyan,
said he also heard that Azeris set fire to a school, resulting in
other deaths.
   In Glendale, Calif., Apo Boghigian, editor of the Armenian
newspaper Asbarez, said he spoke by telephone Wednesday to Hovig
Vassilian, a newspaper editor in Yerevan. Boghigian said Vassilian
described the demonstrators in Yerevan as ``very peaceful'' but
said clashes elsewhere had resulted in deaths.
   Four victims were to be buried Thursday in Askeran, an Armenian
village of about 1,000 people, Boghigian said.
   In Nagorno-Karabakh's main city, Sepanakert, about 120,000
people have demonstrated daily since Feb. 13, said one resident.
   The 17-year-old student, interviewed in a Moscow airport after
arriving from Armenia, said some Armenians had been killed by
Azeris in the region, but she had no details.
   The official Tass news agency said a deputy prosecutor from the
central government was sent to Azerbaidzhan, indicating serious
concern over the unrest.
   Tass quoted the prosecutor, Alexander Katusev, as saying: ``All
sorts of rumors and inventions that are being circulated mostly
outside of the Nagorno-Karabakh Autnomous Region and for which
gullible people often fall are groundless.''
   He acknowledged, however, that crimes were committed and
promised to investigate.
   There was no way to verify the reports independently because the
government barred foreign reporters from traveling to the area.
   Gorgisyan, interviewed by telephone, estimated there were more
than 1 million demonstrators in Yerevan. A telephone operator said
that figure seemed accurate.
   Soldiers arrived Thursday morning and took up discreet positions
in downtown Yerevan, particularly around key government buildings,
Gorgisyan said. They deployed camouflaged trucks downtown and
stationed tanks in outlying areas, said Gorgisyan, a 26-year-old
member of an underground group called the Alliance for National
Determination.
   The soldiers did not try to stop the demonstration, and
Gorgisyan said the protesters were trying not to provoke the troops.
   ``We're trying not to break any laws. The demonstration is very
well organized and orderly,'' he said.
   He said businesses and schools were closed in the city and in
many other parts of the Armenian republic, the smallest of the
Soviet Union's 15 republics and home to 3.4 million Soviets.
   In Nagorno-Karabakh, the student said she saw a large crowd of
demonstrators Thursday in Lenin Square in Stepanakert.
   ``Practically the whole population is there. They've come from
all the villages,'' said the student, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   The protests were continuing around the clock. ``No one's
sleeping. No one is going to work. The only stores open are
groceries,'' she said.
   An official at the Armenian representational offices in Moscow
in charge of internal matters, Rudolf Khatchyanov, confirmed a
major demonstration by Armenians was going on. He said to call
authorities in Yerevan for more details, but telephone calls to
police in Yerevan did not go through.
   The Communist Party's national Central Committee this month
decided Nagorno-Karabakh should remain part of Azerbaidzhan. Radio
Moscow said Armenian authorities planned to ask the Central
Committee to reconsider its position.
   The demonstrations in the region began after the party's
decision was announced, Ayrikyan said.
   Tass announced Wednesday night that an Armenian, Genrikh
Pogosyan, had been named party leader in the disputed region. He
replaced Boris Kevorkov, who also is Armenian.

   Prosecutors said Thursday it may take
up to a month to decide whether to file charges in the death of a
woman whose head was cut off and frozen in hopes of bringing her
back to life someday in a new body.
   The Riverside County Coroner's Office this week ruled the death
of 83-year-old Dora Kent a homicide caused by a lethal dose of
barbiturates. She died in December at the Alcor Life Extension
Foundation cryonics laboratory.
   Assistant District Attorney Jay Thompson Hanks said the decision
to bring charges could take up to a month ``only because there are
other questions to be asked and answered, and other pieces of
evidence we want tested or examined.''
   Thompson said ``a wide range of charges'' is being contemplated.
Those under investigation include ``everyone associated with the
death,'' he said.
   Mrs. Kent's son, Saul Kent, 48, is a supporter of the cryonics
movement, which freezes bodies or heads in the belief that science
will advance to the point where they can be brought back to life.
   On Dec. 9, Mrs. Kent's physician determined she was gravely ill.
Her son then removed her from a Riverside nursing home and brought
her to Alcor.
   Kent says his mother was maintained there briefly on a
respirator before dying Dec. 11. Her head was surgically removed.
   The coroner's office investigated because no doctor was present
when Mrs. Kent died.
   The coroner asked to examine the head, but Kent has refused to
give it location. A judge blocked the coroner from disturbing any
of the frozen remains at Alcor.
   Mrs. Kent's son said barbiturates are used after death to slow
brain damage caused by lack of oxygen. But the coroner's
investigation concluded that Mrs. Kent was alive when drugs were
administered.

<HEAD>US Officials Feared for Hostages If Iran Contacts Cut, Regan Says</HEAD>

   Reagan administration officials were led to
believe they had to keep dealing with Iran or American hostages
could be killed, former White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan
said in a deposition released Thursday.
   Regan's account of the arms-for-hostages program was revealed in
depositions taken last summer by the congressional Iran-Contra
committees.
   Regan said that at first he supported the idea of allowing
Israel to sell U.S.-made weapons to Iran in September 1985 in
return for freeing American hostages held by pro-Iranian terrorists
in Lebanon.
   ``I thought it was worth pursuing,'' Regan said of the
initiative. ``It was an opening. I thought we should explore it.''
   By December, Regan said he had changed his mind. Another
shipment of weapons was sent to Iran in November, but only one
hostage _ the Rev. Benjamin Weir _ was freed in the fall of 1985.
   Asked why, Regan said: ``Well, the thing had been a fiasco up to
that point, in my judgment it had not worked. We were dealing with
some very unusual people.
   ``We were fooling around for the better part of six months with
very little results to show for it, and I couldn't see the value of
pursuing that avenue any more. I thought we were dealing either
with the wrong people or in the wrong way.''
   But Regan said John M. Poindexter, the former national security
adviser, convinced him to go along with the more shipments.
Poindexter told President Reagan and Regan that ``there was a whole
new lead and a whole new plan and that it might turn thing around.''
   In addition, Regan said the president, Vice President George
Bush and Poindexter received some unsettling news from Robert F.
McFarlane, who had been Poindexter's predecessor at the National
Security Council.
   McFarlane, who continued to work on the hostage project after
his resignation from the NSC, traveled to London in December to
meet Manucher Ghorbanifar, a middleman in the U.S.-Iran
relationship.
   Regan was asked whether on his return McFarlane indicated that
if discussions with the Iranians were terminated, the hostages
could be killed.
   ``Yes,'' replied the former chief of staff.
   ``This was becoming increasingly evident, that unless we got on
a new tack, we would (a) probably never see our hostages; or (b)
the whole project would end in dismal failure,'' Regan said.
   In January 1986, the United States began shipping weapons
directly to Iran. The project ended in November after revelations
that profits from the sale of weapons to Iran had been diverted to
the Nicaraguan Contras. Nine Americans remain hostage in Lebanon.

   When Majority Leader Robert Byrd forced the
Senate into its night-and-day campaign spending filibuster on
Tuesday, he said he wanted to expose Republican stalling tactics to
the American public.
   The public got a show, but it was not quite the one the West
Virginia Democrat was looking for.
   Overshadowing the lesson in how a Senate minority can use the
debate rules to thwart the will of the majority was a late-night
cops-and-robbers show produced by the Democrats.
   The climax came early Wednesday when a plainclothes police posse
led by Sergeant-at-Arms Henry Giugni, acting on orders from
Democrats, pushed through the office door of Sen. Bob Packwood,
R-Ore., arrested him and carried him feet first into the Senate
chamber.
   Packwood's commanded performance gave Byrd the quorum he needed
to keep the filibuster going. It also gave angry Republicans a
rallying point to shift the focus away from their refusal to let
the Senate vote on a Democratic bill with 52 co-sponsors from the
100-member chamber.
   ``Illegal, unlawful, null and void,'' snarled Arlen Specter,
R-Pa.
   The former Philadelphia district attorney said Packwood's
apprehension ``really constituted false arrest of a U.S. senator.
... There is a sense that the Senate is falling apart, that the
Senate is disintegrating.''
   Specter complained that his colleague was treated like a
``common criminal,'' subjected to police-state measures appropriate
to ``Nazi Germany and communist Russia.''
   ``Banana republic,'' snapped Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. ``The tyranny
of the majority,'' said acting minority leader Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.
``Demeaning and humiliating,'' was the verdict of Malcolm Wallop,
R-Wyo.
   Democrats responded that Packwood _ and other absent Republicans
who escaped the posse's clutches _ had it coming.
   After all, they said, Democrats were only forcing the GOP to do
something that voters sent them to Washington to do: answer the
bell and vote.
   ``In the span of 45 minutes, the entire Republican Party in the
United States Senate, with the exception of one, the designated
(floor) leader, vanished into the night,'' said Sen. John Kerry,
D-Mass.
   Like most filibusters, this one was a game of chicken. Which
side would cave in? Would the Senate compromise over the central
question of setting spending limits for Senate races?
   Democrats insist that limits are crucial to any legislation to
curb the escalating cost of getting elected.
   But Republican leaders held fast that limits were not negotiable.
   After vowing to keep the Senate in continuous session at least
through the end of next week, Byrd agreed late Wednesday to bring
the filibuster to a close at 5 p.m. Thursday, get a night's sleep
and vote Friday on a Democratic motion to shut off debate and bring
the bill to a vote. It finally ended at 7 p.m., two hours past the
original target.
   Byrd will probably lose that cloture vote, just as he lost a
record seven cloture votes last year, never getting closer than 55
of the 60 votes needed to end the debate that has consumed 30 days
since last June.
   Republicans, outnumbered 54 to 46, have made opposition to
spending limits a party issue. So far, only three GOP senators have
broken ranks and supported cloture: bill co-sponsors Robert
Stafford of Vermont and John Chafee of Rhode Island and non-sponsor
Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas.
   One key to the eventual outcome is a handful of other
Republicans who are known to support some form of spending limits
but who thus far have stayed loyal to their party's line.
   Democrats had hoped to pick up support for cloture before they
had to concede defeat and pull the bill from the floor. The
necessary crossovers never materialized, leaving campaign finance a
very sick, if not dead, issue for the 100th Congress.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Says Move To Oust Noriega Gutsy; No Move To Drop
Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILL LESTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Panamanian strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
left Panama because of attempts to oust him from power, ``we would
attempt to extradite him like any other dope dealer,'' a federal
prosecutor said Thursday.
   ``There is no consideration whatsoever to dropping this
indictment,'' said Richard Gregorie, chief assistant U.S. attorney
in Florida's southern district. ``I have not been asked by anybody
to do that.''
   Noriega was indicted in Miami with 15 others Feb. 4 on charges
of taking at least $4.6 million to protect shipments of Colombian
cocaine, launder money, supply drug laboratories and shield drug
kingpins. Also charged were Medellin drug cartel leader Pablo
Escobar Gaviria and a top Noriega aide, Capt. Luis del Cid.
   Gregorie, the lead prosecutor in the Noriega drug case, said
Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle made a ``pretty gutsy
move'' Thursday in ordering Noriega out of his post and named a
replacement.
   ``Assuming he does step down, he's going to be like any other
citizen,'' Gregorie said, ``and I would assume there might be a
great likelihood that he would leave the country and go somewhere
where we'd have a chance of getting him.''
   In Tampa, a grand jury Feb. 5 indicted Noriega and Panamanian
businessman Enrique Pretelt on marijuana conspiracy and importation
charges.
   A 1904 treaty between the United States and Panama does not
oblige either state to extradite its own citizens.
   The indictment alleged that Noriega allied himself with the
Medellin cartel and once enlisted the help of Cuban leader Fidel
Castro to mediate a dispute with the cartel over drug money.
   Castro said in an interview with NBC News aired Thursday that
Jose Blandon, former Panamanian consul general in New York, lied
about Castro's role as a mediator for Noriega. Castro was named in
the indictment, but not charged.
   U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner charged at the time of the indictment
that Noriega used his position of power in Panama to ``sell the
country of Panama to drug traffickers.''
   If Noriega is ever brought to trial and convicted of all
charges, he could face up to 145 years in prison and fines of more
than $1.1 million, prosecutors say.
   A defendant in the Miami indictment, Brian Alden Davidow, 26, of
Miami surrendered to authorities and pleaded innocent a week ago.
   Ambler Moss, former U.S. ambassador to Panama, said Thursday
that Delvalle's move was unlikely to bring Noriega to trial.
   ``It's highly unusual because the military in Panama has
dominated politics there for a very long time,'' said Moss,
ambassasor from 1978 to 1982. ``It's very unusual that he would
even dare try to separate the head of the armed forces from his
powers.
   ``It's a very courageous act, although we don't know whether
some deal was worked out in advance,'' he said. ``I doubt this
would ever result in his standing trial in the United States.''
   Gregorie held a glimmer of hope. ``If Mr. Noriega chooses to
come here tomorrow morning to be arraigned, he will receive
discovery immediately,'' he said, ``and we will be prepared to go
to trial in 60 days.''

<HEAD>Writer Praises Former Soviet Leader in Major Reassessment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a major reassessment of Nikita Khrushchev, a
prominent writer has said the former Soviet leader deserves praise
for ending Stalin's cult of personality and introducing economic
reforms.
   The article was the most wide-ranging appraisal of Khrushchev in
the official media to date.
   Fedor Burlatsky said Khrushchev should be praised for putting an
end to the cult of personality that surrounded his predecessor,
Josef Stalin, and for improving the economy and bringing modern
technology to the country.
   Burlatsky also believes, however, that Khrushchev did a bad job
of managing the vast Soviet bureaucracy and was not completely
candid about the nation's problems.
   ``Now that we are guided by the experience of glasnost, we can
see clearly how little was done to inform people about the past,
about real problems, about planned decisions,'' Burlatsky wrote in
an article published Wednesday in the Literary Gazette newspaper.
   Khruschev ruled in 1953-1964 and declared that the Soviet Union
would bury the West, but he was later removed from the leadership
in disgrace.
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has encouraged a review of
history in his campaign for ``glasnost,'' or openness in some
matters.
   Numerous articles have appeared about Stalin and his excesses
but Burlatsky is the first to take a detailed look at Khrushchev.
The journalist and playwright, who was an aide to Khrushchev, said
the former leader's name was taboo for nearly 20 years until
Gorbachev mentioned him Nov. 2.
   ``A wind of change swept the country, the people's spirits rose,
they took heart, became bolder and more confident,'' Gorbachev
said, and praised Khrushchev for ridding the country of Stalin's
cult of personality.
   Burlatsky, 61, picked up that theme in his full-page article.
   ``The main significance Khrushchev gave to the ideological side
of matters was ... unmasking the cult of personality, to speak out
the truth about the crimes of the 30s and other periods,'' he wrote.
   He praised Khrushchev for such technological achievements as
putting the first man in space and reviving Soviet agriculture.
   Khrushchev was not candid in revealing his actions under Stalin,
however, because ``many in the party knew about the role that he
played in persecuting'' people, Burlatsky wrote.
   He also faulted Khrushchev for using ``traditional
administrative and even bureaucratic methods'' that ruined what
began as bold reforms in agriculture and the overall economy.
   Khrushchev was ousted from the leadership in October 1964 by a
``strange symbiosis of political forces'' ranging from
conservatives and Stalinists to reform-minded officials, Burlatsky
said.
   After the fall, Khrushchev sank into obscurity. He died in 1971
and the government of Leonid I. Brezhnev ordered that he be buried
in Moscow's Novodevichy Cemetery, second in importance to the
Kremlin wall.
   Rumors have been circulating that his remains might be moved to
the Kremlin, where the nation's other top leaders are buried.
   In a telephone conversation from his newspaper office Thursday
night, Burlatsky said he had not heard any proposals for moving the
body.
   ``Maybe some informal group is talking about it, but it's
certainly not a firm proposal among party members,'' said
Burlatsky, who is a member of the Communist Party.

<HEAD>ETA Kidnapping Appears to End Truce That Led to Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Basque separatists appear to have broken a
60-day truce they offered the government by kidnapping 58-year-old
businessman Emiliano Revilla Sanza, officials said Thursday.
   Deputy Prime Minister Alfonso Guerra told reporters the
government considers the kidnapping an attack by the Basque
separatist organization ETA and will not pursue contacts begun with
the organization ``because we don't talk with terrorists.''
   Rafael Vazquez, a spokesman for the Revilla family, said there
had been no contact with armed kidnappers who seized Revilla at
11:30 p.m. Wednesday outside his home in central Madrid. He said
the family did not know the identity of the three men and a woman
witnesses saw forcing Revilla into a car.
   The kidnapping of the well-known Madrid real estate developer
occurred after reports that the government had resumed contacts
over the weekend with ETA members in exile in Algeria.
   ETA, whose initials stand for Basque land and liberty in the
Basque language, has taken responsibility for killing more than 600
people in a 20-year campaign for independence in Spain's three
northern Basque provinces.
   During his annual address to Parliament on Wednesday, Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez said Spaniards should not lower their
guard against terrorism despite optimism created by reports of
contacts between the government and ETA.
   Gonzalez said his government had agreed to resume talks only if
the organization respected a 60-day truce offer it made Jan. 28.
   The government broke off preliminary talks with ETA in Algiers
after the group claimed responsibility for the Dec. 11 car bombing
of a Zaragoza Civil Guard barracks in which 11 people were killed.
   Since 1977, ETA has kidnapped 63 people, most of them Basque
businessmen, to raise funds for its operations.

<HEAD>Economy Expands At 4.5 Percent Rate In Fourth Quarter</HEAD>

   The U.S. economy expanded at a 4.5 percent
annual rate from October through December, the fastest pace in
almost two years, the government reported Thursday.
   The growth in the gross national product, the broadest measure
of the economy's health, was revised up from an original estimate
of 4.2 percent made a month ago.
   The Reagan administration said the growth rate showed the
economic recovery, now in its sixth year, a record for peacetime,
was suffering no ill effects from the October stock market
collapse. However, private economists said they were still
concerned about the lopsided nature of the growth.
   The rapid expansion in the fourth quarter occured without a
pickup in inflation. A price index tied to the GNP rose at an
annual rate of 3.7 percent from October through December, little
changed from a 3.4 percent increase in the third quarter.
   Three-fourths of the growth last quarter came from a buildup of
business inventories which was occurring at the same time that
consumer spending was plunging 3.1 percent, the biggest spending
drop in more than seven years.
   The last such sharp drop in consumer spending occurred in 1980
during the brief recession that year which helped doom President
Jimmy Carter's re-election bid.
   Many economists believe that growth will slow substantially in
the first half of this presidential election year, but in what
could be good news for Republican chances to hold onto the White
House, they are not forecasting an outright recession.
   Some analysts said the revisions made in the new GNP report made
them more confident that a recession can be avoided.
   ``As we move into 1988, there has to be a slowdown to work off
excessive retail inventories, but it will be a pause and not a
recession,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economiXq

   released, hinted at his press conference Wednesday night
that the figure would be a good one and he attacked Democratic
presidential candidates for misrepresenting his administration's
economic achievements.
   ``If anyone listened for more than 15 minutes to their
candidates, you would decide that we're burdened by inflation, high
interest rates and unemployment, when at the moment none of those
things are true,'' Reagan said.
   Analysts said they were encouraged by the new GNP report because
it showed that consumer spending, while falling sharply, was not as
weak as previously believed. The report also increased the estimate
of business investment spending, another area of expected strength
in the new year.
   ``The economy is better than most people think. Consumers are
not fizzling out,'' Sinai said.
   On the basis of the revised GNP figures, Sinai said he had
boosted his estimate of growth in the current quarter to between 1
percent and 2 percent, up from an earlier prediction that growth
could be as low as 0.5 percent in the first three months of this
year.
   James Cochran, an economist with Texas Commerce Bancshares of
Houston, said that the new GNP report ``confirms that we will have
positive growth in the first quarter. It won't be fantastic, but it
will be positive.''
   Some economists had been so concerned that the huge buildup in
inventories would force widespread factory layoffs, that they were
predicting possibly one quarter of negative GNP growth. A
traditional recession is defined as two consecutive quarters in
which the GNP declines.
   The 4.5 percent increase in economic growth followed a gain of
4.3 percent in the third quarter and was the fastest advance since
a 5.4 percent rise in the first quarter of 1986.
   The fourth-quarter gain boosted growth for the year to 3.9
percent, when measured from the end of 1986, up slightly from the
3.8 percent estimate made a month ago. Growth when all four
quarters of the year are averaged together showed a 2.9 percent
increase in 1987, the same as 1986.
   The Reagan administration is forecasting that growth this year
will slow to a rate of 2.4 percent. Many private economists believe
even this scaled-down figure is too optimistic given the huge
overhang of inventories that will slow production in the early part
of the year.
   The administration believes the country will get half of its
growth this year from an improving trade deficit as American
manufacturers continue to benefit from the decline in the value of
the dollar.
   That trend was evident in the fourth quarter as the country's
trade deficit, after adjusting for inflation, shrank by $2 billion
as exports shot up by 15.1 percent, outpacing a 9.7 percent rise in
imports.
   The various changes added $42 billion to the total GNP in the
fourth quarter, leaving it at an inflation-adjusted $3.88 trillion.

<HEAD>President Orders Noriega Out of Office</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Eric
Arturo Delvalle's nationally broadcast message ordering Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega removed from his post as military chief, as
translated from Spanish by The Associated Press:
   ``Panama currently is experiencing one of the most difficult and
dangerous moments of its history. It really is lamentable that
after having achieved in a few years, with international help and
support, success in the struggle for its sovereignty, and after
having begun a transition toward a promised democracy and even more
recently having started its stalled economy, today the country
finds itself virtually at siege economically by external pressures
and tensions, in its international prestige as a nation.
   What has been able to take us to such a terrible crossroads in
such a short time?
   Certainly a dose of unawareness from many, exaggerated ambitions
from some and a great lack of understanding from others have
contributed decisively to placing us in such a severe as well as
critical situation.
   I should confess with honor that in my unchangeable desire to
achieve my goal I have been able to commit some mistakes, but it is
even worse to be a victim as I have been of so many
misunderstandings without allowing that they might change my way of
acting, as I am doing with deep love for my country.
   I must consider with sadness that many of the successes that
have been obtained have been vanishing in the past eight months.
   This has converted my concerns into fruitless yearnings.
   What is certain is that the mistaken positions, the unconsulted
actions and the mistakes committed, now or in the past, have led to
acts of extreme significance, such as those that represent the
noticeable paralysis, the rhythm of social and economic development
that we have experienced since the midway point of last year.
   The pressures and tensions of which we are an object and the
serious accusations of the grand jury of Florida against Noriega,
accusations which have been gathered and spread by the
international press, have damaged the image and prestige of Panama.
   These actions which U.S. officials have taken on the basis that
the country is not moving toward a true democracy and the
accusations against Noriega, are starting to be reflected in an
unfavorable international attitude toward the Panamanian nation
that is financial as well as diplomatic.
   That situation places the republic before a very serious risk in
which the present and future well being of the Panamanian people is
found at risk.
   Facing this enormous responsibility as a leader, several days
ago I decided that I should suggest, and that's what I did, to Gen.
Noriega that he voluntarily step aside from his high command until
the charges that had been raised against him might be investigated,
and that would reflect highly on his own good and the health and
tranquility of the republic.
   I have not had evidence that the healthy purposes that motivated
my suggestion in the sense expressed have had any impact
whatsoever. I decided that it was prudent to wait some days so that
he might have sufficient time to meditate on the seriousness of the
situation to which he is exposing himself and to which he is
submitting the country.
   For all that might be deduced that the accusations against Gen.
Noriega have a political nature, the internal situation of Panama
cannot be ignored. Each day it becomes more complex and dangerous
and there will not be peace nor liberty nor progress in Panama nor
will be be able to perfect or consolidate our democratic system,
unless we overcome the passions that have been unleashed and we
clarify the deeds beyond all doubt.
   To find solutions to the serious crisis that affects
institutional life and economic stability, it is indispensable that
as soon as possible the country might return to the climate of
peace and tranquility.
   The reasons that might take us to fiscal and economic imbalance
and that might push thousands of Panamanians to unemployment,
misery and despair cannot persist.
   The causes for which the international credit agencies and the
international banking community, which always have collaborated
with us, might turn their backs to us, worsening our already
weakened and precarious situation, cannot persist.
   The attitudes and conduct that might justify friendly nations to
adopt positions that isolate our country and reduce the prestige of
our nation cannot persist.
   We cannot persist in incubating our own disaster, whatever might
be the motive, reason or justification that any entity, group or
person might brandish, because nothing or no one comes above the
nation.''

<HEAD>Mistrial Declared In Highway Patrol Officer's Murder Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS GEORGATOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mistrial was declared Thursday after a jury
deadlocked in the case of a former California Highway Patrol
officer accused of murdering a motorist he had pulled over at an
isolated freeway exit in 1986.
   ``It does not seem to me that any further deliberation is likely
to produce a verdict,'' Superior Court Judge Richard Huffman after
seven days of deliberation in the case against 37-year-old Craig
Peyer of Poway.
   Peyer was accused of strangling Cara Knott, a 20-year-old San
Diego State University student. The 13-year CHP veteran was the
second officer in the agency's 58-year history to be charged with
killing a motorist while on duty.
   Jury forewoman Walnetta Lenhardt said that after three ballots,
jurors deadlocked 7-5 in favor of conviction.
   ``I have always thought he was innocent. It's in God's hands. It
always will be,'' Peyer's wife, Karen, said outside court.
   Steve Casey, a spokesman for the district attorney's office,
said no decision had been made on whether to retry the case against
Peyer.
   ``We're tough. We'll do it for Cara. We're going to see it
through for Cara,'' said a tearful Joyce Knott, the victim's mother.
   Peyer has been free on $1 million bail throughout the trial.
First-degree murder carries a sentence of 25 years to life in
prison.
   Peyer was fired by the Highway Patrol in May after an internal
investigation.
   The prosecution in the trial that began Jan. 19 alleged that
Peyer, patrolling Interstate 15, stopped Knott because of a
defective tail light and forced her to drive down a dark, isolated
offramp.
   Knott's white Volkswagen was found abandoned in a cul-de-sac
near the bottom of an exit, and her body was found at the bottom of
a nearby 65-foot highway bridge.
   Twenty-two women had testified during the trial that Peyer
pulled them over on I-15 and directed them down the same isolated
ramp. State officials closed the ramp for safety reasons soon after
Knott's killing.
   Prosecutors presented blood and fiber evidence that they said
linked Peyer to the victim, as well as two surprise witnesses who
said they saw a CHP unit pull over a light-colored Volkswagen on
I-15 the night Knott was slain.
   The defense argued the blood and fiber evidence was flimsy and
unreliable and accused the two witnesses of lying, noting both had
waited a year before coming forward with their stories.

<HEAD>City Council Approves Lifting Ban On Night Games At Wrigley Field</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 3 grafs after 6th graf pvs, `They may ...,' to UPDATE
with comment from governor's spokesman on effect of vote and Cubs
statement about installation of lights.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ED WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council voted Thursday to lift a ban on
night games at the only major-league ballpark without lights,
signaling a likely end to a 72-year-tradition of daytime-only
baseball at Wrigley Field.
   The vote was 29-19 in favor of lights.
   The Tribune Co., owner of the Chicago Cubs, has threatened to
move the team out of Chicago if lights aren't allowed at the
venerable, ivy-covered ballpark.
   A state law limiting noise at night effectively banned night
games at Wrigley. The law was suspended last year for post-season
nighttime play, and similar action may be needed to allow
regular-season night games, some officials said Thursday.
   Alderman Bobby Rush, chairman of the committee that held
hearings on the city ordinance, said state legislators have agreed
to follow the city in rolling back the ban.
   ``They may have to make some adjustments, but there won't be any
snags,'' he said. ``The Cubs will probably proceed with lights as
soon as weather permits.''
   Jim Bray, a spokesman for Gov. James R. Thompson, said the
effect of the council vote was uncertain.
   ``There's always been a question whether the original
legislation ever would have been able to prevent night games if the
Cubs wanted to and did install lights,'' Bray said.
   The Cubs said after the vote that the club would install a $5
million lighting system that should be ready in four to six months.
   The proposal approved by the council and endorsed by Mayor
Eugene Sawyer would allow eight night games this season and 18 each
of the following years until 2002 at the ballpark.
   At the team's Mesa, Ariz., training camp, pitcher Rick Sutcliffe
said, ``I think the night games will give us a chance to rest up
during the day after coming off long road trips.
   ``A lot of times we don't get home from road trips till 2 or 3
in the morning, and only get about four hours of sleep before
heading back out to the ballpark,'' he said.
   Wrigley Field, a neighborhood landmark since 1914, is bordered
by small apartment houses where residents can sit on the roof and
watch the action for free. Many residents of ``Wrigleyville'' are
vehemently opposed to night games, anticipating rowdy crowds and
parking problems.
   League owners voted earlier Thursday to play the 1990 All-Star
game at Wrigley Field if the city lifts the ban on night games.
   By playing during the day only, club executives say, the team
misses out on lucrative revenue from TV networks interested in
airing evening baseball.
   If the Cubs made the playoffs while the night-game ban was in
force, the team probably would have to play elsewhere, they say,
because playoff games are scheduled to accommodate network requests
for prime-time exposure.
   The Cubs finished last in the National League East last year.
   Opponents say night games in Wrigleyville would mean boisterous
fans pouring out of bars in the wee hours, limited parking for
residents returning from work, and littered lawns and streets.
   ``I have no objection to people having a good time, but they
just don't respect the neighborhood,'' said Dwight Guyer, who can
hear the roar of the crowd from his home a few blocks away. ``I
don't like people urinating in my yard. I don't like to wake up to
trash.''
   The Chicago Tribune, also owned by the Tribune Co., entered the
fray last week with a lively editorial that said aldermen opposed
to lights at Wrigley Field were ``boneheads'' and ``political
lightweights.''
   State Sen. William Marovitz, a Chicago Democrat, said the state
noise law could prevent regular-season night games at Wrigley.
   ``If the noise from Wrigley Field violates the decibel limit, a
resident might file a lawsuit,'' said Marovitz, who represents
Wrigleyville and is against the lights.
   But Rep. John Cullerton, another Chicago Democrat, said City
Council approval clears the way for regular-season night games
without further legislative action.
   ``If we did nothing, they could play night games,'' said
Cullerton, who also represents Wrigleyville.

   A bomb in a taxicab exploded Wednesday
outside the building housing the Greek Embassy in west Beirut,
killing a street vendor and a passenger in the car, police said.
   The cab driver and three passers-by were wounded when the bomb,
hidden in the trunk of the moving taxi, blew up.
   Police said the bomb exploded at 2:40 p.m. in front of the Sadat
Tower, a building that also houses offices of the embassies of
Finland and Mexico.
   Police said there was nobody at the Greek Embassy at the time of
the blast. No arrests were made.
   The Finnish and Mexican missions have been closed since April
1986, when most foreigners left Moslem west Beirut after a wave of
assassinations and kidnappings involving foreign nationals.
   The bomb turned the white Mercedes taxi into a pile of twisted
metal. No group claimed responsibility for the bombing.
   Syrian troops, who were deployed in west Beirut to restore
security, blocked off the site for half an hour after the explosion.
   More than 100,000 people have been killed since Lebanon's civil
war began in April 1975. Druse, Shiite Moslem and Christian
militias have done most of the fighting.

   A former firefighter accused of setting a
$6.5 million string of fires reported the first blaze to police and
helped authorities erect barricades at the second fire, a
prosecutor said Thursday.
   Adrian Julius Howe, 23, will be charged Friday with six counts
of arson, said Okanogan County Prosecutor Jack Burchard. He was
ordered held on $250,000 bail. Each count carries up to life in
prison and a $50,000 fine.
   Howe, arrested Wednesday, reported the first blaze Dec. 6 at an
elementary school, helped set up barricades at a Dec. 14 fire, and
was seen by police at three other blazes, Burchard told Superior
Court Judge James R. Thomas.
   The fires began in December, when Omak North Elementary School
was hit twice within eight days. Two churches in Omak and a church
parsonage there also were burned in a week's time earlier this
month.
   Howe lived in a trailer court across the street from the school
in December, then moved to an apartment across from one of the
churches before the February fires, Burchard said.
   Howe, who Sheriff Jim Weed said had experience fighting
wildfires, was arrested by investigators of a special 12-member
arson task force and confessed to all six fires, Burchard told
Thomas.
   Burchard and Weed said there was no apparent motive for the
fires. Investigators have no reason to believe Howe, a high school
dropout, had any animosity toward the elementary school he
attended, Burchard said.
   The investigation depleted the small rural county's coffers,
prompting the county to declare an emergency and request state
help. The Washington House voted Wednesday to appropriate $150,000
to help cover the investigation costs.
   A lifelong resident of Omak, a town of 4,000, Howe was employed
at a lumber mill on the Colville Indian Reservation. Friends who
knew him from several bars he frequented described Howe as a loner
who used to get into fights.
   ``I don't think that he had anything to do with it,'' said Brian
Marbach, a friend of Howe's for 19 years.
   Howe, who spent time in the Army, recently had been trying to
reconcile with a girlfrend by whom he had a young daughter, Marbach
said.

   World production of sugar in 1987-88 has been
revised upward to an estimated 101.9 million metric tons, a 1
percent increase from the previous forecast of 100.8 million tons
made last October, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   The department's Foreign Agricultural Service said the revision
``reflects changes in several key countries'' since the October
estimate.
   Regionally, the new figures showed increases in raw sugar
production for North America, 10.92 million tons, compared with
10.71 million forecast in October; the European Economic Community,
13.85 million tons, compared with 13.43 million; and the Soviet
Union, 9 million tons, compared with 8.3 million.
   Despite the larger estimate, this season's global sugar
production still is expected to trail the 102.8 million tons

   A elderly man with two rifles burst into
a board meeting at a retirement home where he once lived and opened
fire Thursday, wounding four people and sending a fifth into heart
failure, authorities said.
   The 79-year-old gunman fled the meeting room at the Masonic Home
for the Aged with one rifle tied around his neck with twine but
surrendered moments later, said police spokesman Dee Anderson.
   The four people struck by gunfire suffered minor wounds, she
said. However, Willie Joe Wright, 67, who suffered the heart
attack, was in critical condition at Arlington Memorial Hospital,
said spokeswoman Tenya Woods.
   ``Apparently, they had a board meeting and one former resident,
who was apparently disgruntled, walked into the board room and
started shooting'' at the 15 to 16 people there, Anderson said.
   The assailant, whose identity was not released, had lived at the
home for about three years before being evicted in September for
breaking rules, Anderson said. He knew when the monthly board
meeting was to be held, she said.
   When officers confronted the man in a kitchen in the building,
he calmly surrendered and gave them his rifle. Both weapons were
.22-caliber semiautomatic rifles, Anderson said.
   ``He did not give any information to police,'' Anderson said.
   Officials at the man's current residence, the Arlington Villa
retirement home, said they were shocked to hear of the shooting.
``He is a good resident, very congenial and sociable,'' said
administrator Gennie Pace.
   Officials of the Masonic home refused to comment on the 11 a.m.
shooting and put the buildings and grounds of the home off limits
to visitors.
   Several women gathered outside the home after hearing of the
shooting to make sure their relatives, residents of the home, were
safe. One woman, who declined to be identified, said her mother had
lived there for the past 13 years and called it ``a wonderful
place.''
   Of the shooting victims, Eldon Brooks, 54, was in fair condition
with a gunshot wound to the left thigh, Ms. Woods said, while Frank
Smith, 77, was in good condition with a gunshot wound in his back.
   John Thompson, 49, was in fair condition with a gunshot wound to
his right arm and was later transferred to Harris Methodist
Hospital in Fort Worth.
   Dorothy Heath, 67, received a gunshot wound to her thigh and
complained of chest pains. She was in fair condition.
   An employee at the retirement home who would not give her name
identified Ms. Heath as the home's administrator.

   The State Department on Wednesday suggested
that Americans planning trips to Rio de Janeiro consider postponing
their travel because of torrential rains and flooding that have
killed 300 people and left thousands homeless.
   No formal travel advisory was announced, but Ruth van Heuven, a
department spokeswoman, said people who called to check on
conditions in the Brazilian resort city were told they ``may wish
to defer their trip until the local situation improves.''
   The department said rains were expected to continue
indefinitely, city services were strained, some areas were without
electricity and water and several tourist areas were inaccessible.

<HEAD>7 of 8 Convicted in Westies Rackets Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven people were convicted Wednesday on federal
racketeering charges for taking part in the violent activities of a
murderous gang known as the Westies, which terrorized Manhattan's
Hell's Kitchen neighborhood for 20 years.
   An eighth defendant was acquitted of all charges as the
five-month trial ended.
   In addition to the racketeering convictions, some of the
defendants, including reputed Westies boss James ``Jimmy'' Coonan,
were found guilty of crimes ranging from attempted murder and
loansharking to drug dealing and tax evasion.
   But the key verdict was the jury's decision that the Westies did
exist, that it constituted a racketeering enterprise and that the
convicted defendants had participated in its activities to further
the gang's criminal goals.
   Defense lawyers had contended that there was no such
organization as the Westies. Even former gang members testifying
for the prosecution said the name ``Westies'' was created by the
police and the news media to describe Irish-American hoodlums on
Manhattan's West Side.
   Prosecutors Mary Lee Warren and David Brodsky had contended the
six men and two women on trial were the violent core of the
Westies, which they said seized control of the neighborhood once
known as Hell's Kitchen and maintained their rule ``with horrible
and ghoulish acts of murder.''
   Witnesses testified that in at least three murders, the victim's
body was cut up and disposed of in what Ms. Warren called ``the
nightmarish signature crime of the Westies.''
   There was also testimony by several witnesses that the Westies
had forged an alliance with the Gambino organized crime family,
said to be the largest and most powerful Mafia group in the country.
   The key prosecution witness, former No. 2 Westie Francis
``Mickey'' Featherstone, said the gang had even shot a union leader
as a favor to reputed Gambino boss John Gotti.
   But the defense attacked the credibility of Featherstone, an
admitted three-time killer, and other informants who testified for
the government in return for leniency.
   Featherstone, who said he had been Coonan's ``right-hand man,''
admitted that he had lied under oath in other cases, had been in
and out of mental institutions, suffered delusions and was a former
abuser of alcohol and drugs.
   The racketeering charges alleged eight murders, four murder
conspiracies and three attempted murders. To be convicted of
racketeering, each defendant had to be found to have committed at
least two of the 28 racketeering acts cited.
   The verdict came on the eighth day of jury deliberations.
   Coonan, 41, was found guilty of attempted murder, murder
conspiracy, loansharking, extortion and income tax evasion among
other crimes.
   His wife, Edna, 44, was convicted of loansharking and tax
charges.
   In addition, the jury found Coonan participated in most of the
racketeering acts charged against him, including seven murders.
   ``A trial on any single act in this indictment would have
resulted in an acquittal,'' said Coonan's lawyer, Gerald Shargel.
``It's just a matter of the government, piling it all together.
That's the nightmare of RICO (the Racketeer Influenced Corrupt
Organizations Act).''
   As the courtroom deputy, Bernard Wasserman, read out the verdict
against William ``Indian'' Bokun, his father swore audibly.
   ``Don't tell me to shush!'' John Bokun angrily told a marshal.
``That's my son there.''
   The younger Bokun, 30, of Manhattan, who was convicted of drug
dealing as well as racketeering, tried to comfort his weeping,
cursing father.
   ``Don't worry pop, I'm all right,'' Bokun shouted across the
courtroom before being led back to jail.
   Only one defendant, John Halo, was acquitted on all charges.
   In addition to the Coonans, both of Hazlet, N.J. and Bokun, the
others convicted of racketeering and racketeering conspiracy were:
James ``Jimmy Mack'' McElroy, 42; Richard ``Muggsy'' Ritter, 50;
Thomas Collins, 53, and his wife Florence, 52, all of Manhattan.
   Knapp scheduled sentencing for April 18. All defendants face up
to 20 years apiece on both racketeering and racketeering conspiracy.

<HEAD>Knoxville Publisher's Plan To Launch Magazines Sparks Ire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A publishing company's plan to offer a
new series of magazines just for doctors' waiting rooms with the
requirement that the physicians limit purchases of other magazines
has rival publishers furious.
   ``The Constitution says Congress shall make no law abridging
freedom of speech,'' said George Green, a vice president and group
publisher of New York-based Hearst Corp. ``I guess the man from
Tennessee has his own agenda.''
   Whittle Communications expects to put its six quarterly
magazines in the waiting rooms of pediatricians, gynecologists and
family practitioners this fall, said Patti Carr, the company's
corporate marketing associate.
   Whittle is targeting 15,000 doctors' offices its first year, and
about half already have signed up, said spokeswoman Sara Fortune.
Eventually, Whittle hopes to capture 40 percent of doctors' offices
in the top 125 markets in the country, she said.
   Under the subscription agreement, doctors cannot have more than
two non-Whittle publications in the waiting rooms, she said.
   In return, doctors get magazines at a reduced price, free
monthly replacement of worn magazines and an agreement that there
will be no ads for unhealthy products such as alcohol and
cigarettes, said Ms. Fortune.
   The six magazines, collectively called ``The Whittle Family
System,'' will cover beauty and health, living, family life,
fiction, gossip, entertainment and sports.
   ``Each one is designed to be read in 20 or 30 minutes, the time
you usually spend waiting for your doctor,'' said Ms. Fortune.
   Ms. Carr predicted it would be ``the largest launch in the
history of magazines.'' First-year revenues are projected at $37
million, she said.
   ``Most publishers find this whole method unacceptable and are
not going to sit idly by and let it happen,'' said Michael Luftman,
a spokesman for Time Inc. in New York.
   Whittle publishes special-interest magazines for such groups as
students, restaurant workers and medical personnel.

<TEXT>
   A hepatitis epidemic in Shanghai has killed
seven people, but the number of new cases has dropped considerably,
the pro-Beijing Hong Kong newspaper Ta Kung Pao reported Wednesday.
   It quoted Wang Daomin, director of the Shanghai Public Health
Bureau, as saying health officials verified seven deaths. Previous
reports did not mention deaths.
   The viral disease, commonly spread in food and water, causes
inflammation of the liver, nausea, vomiting and fever.
   Wang also was quoted as saying the number of new cases of
hepatitis A had dropped 80 percent from the height of the epidemic.
   Shanghai officials earlier put the number sickened in the
2-month-old outbreak at 16,000. Western doctors there said the
number could be as high as 40,000. The epidemic was blamed on
contaminated clams harvested from polluted coastal waters.
   China's official English-language newspaper China Daily said
Beijing health authorities launched a city-wide sanitation
inspection.
   In Canton, capital of southern Guangdong province, health
officials warned people to refrain from shaking hands, to wash
their hands when visiting others and to avoid eating river snails.

<HEAD>Experts Missed October Storm Because They Relied On Computers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weather experts failed to forecast Britain's worst
weather disaster in nearly 300 years because they stuck too rigidly
to computer forecasts, an official report said Wednesday.
   The Oct. 16 storm killed 17 people and changed Britain's
landscape forever as winds gusting up to 120 mph toppled an
estimated 15 million trees.
   Homes were wrecked, cars smashed and many parts of Britain
suffered the worst power failures since the World War II blitz.
Insurance claims totaled $1.46 billion.
   The report to Defense Secretary George Younger came from the
state-run Meteorological Office, under the Defense Department, and
from an independent panel which studied that report and made its
own inquiries and recommendations.
   It said weather experts failed to predict the storm's severity
because they followed computer projections ``too closely'' and
``too rigidly'' and did not take into account other factors.
   The report recommended stepping up the warning system when bad
weather is on the way and giving forecasters the scientific
background needed to recognize poor computer predictions.
   ``Compared with the French forecasters, the training which ours
receive is shorter (and therefore cheaper) and lays less emphasis
on meteorological theory,'' the report said.
   The defense secretary announced he had accepted the
recommendations.
   The Meteorological Office apparently had no formal system to
allow the senior forecaster to consult more widely when faced with
uncertain or severe weather, the report said.
   It said television forecasts ``played down'' the wind even more
than the Meteorological Office, but in view of the briefing TV
weather experts received, they were not to blame.
   While the report said forecasters shouldn't rely totally on
computers, it said the Meteorological Office must have the most
powerful computer available. It noted a new model will be installed
in June.
   The worst storm to hit Britain was in 1703 when 8,000 people
were killed.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   District of Columbia Police Chief Maurice
Turner said Wednesday he intends to arm up to 1,000 civilian
volunteers as part of an effort to fight a crime spree in the
nation's capital.
   Volunteer reserve officers, who currently lecture neighborhood
groups on crime control and help city residents burglar-proof their
homes, will get guns and full police powers, Turner said in a
statement issued by the police department.
   They'll serve in support positions augmenting the city's
3,880-member police force, accompany officers on regular patrols,
and have the power to make arrests, he said.
   Twenty-one members of the 175-member reserve force were selected
for an extensive training program similar to training given
full-time officers. Turner said ultimately he hopes to expand the
reserve corps to 1,000 officers.
   The trained reserve officers will carry a gun while on duty, but
will be required to turn it in the end of their shifts, said
Turner, who originally disclosed his plan in an interview with The
Washington Times.
   The chief's announcement came amid a surge in crime,
particularly drug-related violence. Fifty-two people have been
murdered in Washington so far this year, compared with 33 at this
time last year. Police say nearly three-quarters of the murders are
drug related.
   Turner said earlier this week that about 100 officers working at
desk jobs will return to patrol work after civilians are found to
fill their positions. Last week, Turner said he was replacing
officers' six-shot service revolvers with 9mm semiautomatic pistols
in an effort to counter the increasingly sophisticated weapons
wielded by drug dealers.
   Mayor Marion Barry has said there are enough officers, but
police union officials said 500 more full-time officers are needed.
   Turner did not say when the new program would go into effect, or
where the reserves would be deployed.

   A grand jury should require Tawana Brawley
and her family to cooperate with authorities investigating the
teen-ager's alleged kidnapping and sexual assault by six white men,
Gov. Mario Cuomo said Wednesday.
   The continued refusal of the girl's lawyers to allow her to
discuss the case with investigators is fostering ``a disrespect for
the process of law,'' the governor said at a news conference.
   Miss Brawley was found wrapped in a plastic garbage bag and
covered with feces, with ``KKK'' and ``nigger'' scrawled on her
body, after being missing for four days last November. She said she
was assaulted by six white men, one of whom flashed a police badge.
   A grand jury will convene Monday in Poughkeepsie to investigate
the case.
   Cuomo said he'll ask state Attorney General Robert Abrams, the
special prosecutor in the case, to ask the grand jury to compel
Miss Brawley and her family to cooperate.
   ``The way the investigation is not proceeding now _ and it's not
proceeding as it should _ is bad for Tawana, is bad for the state,
is bad for the system of justice. And I want to change it,'' Cuomo
said.
   The lawyers for Miss Brawley and her family, C. Vernon Mason and
Alton Maddox Jr., did not return calls to their New York City
offices.
   Nancy Connell, a spokeswoman for Abrams, said that ``we're fully
in agreement with the governor's statement.'' But she would not say
what Abrams will recommend to the grand jury.
   Mason and Maddox have advised Miss Brawley not to cooperate,
have called for Abrams to be removed from the case and for Cuomo to
create a permanent special state prosecutor for racial cases.
   The NAACP lawyer who initially represented Miss Brawley before
being replaced by Mason and Maddox said the two lawyers were using
the girl as a pawn to achieve political aims.
   ``The politicizing of the case in the manner it has been allows
for a lot of speculation and detracts from the genuine sympathy and
outrage this case should have,'' attorney George Hairston told the
Albany Times Union.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, a Pentecostal minister from Brooklyn who
has also been advising the Brawley family, said that because Abrams
maintains a residence in Dutchess County he has a ``relationship''
with Sheriff Frederick Scoralick. Sharpton said Scoralick was a
``suspect'' in the case.
   On Tuesday, a former worker in the attorney general's print shop
was arrested and charged with stealing and disclosing a transcript
of testimony to a previous grand jury that was investigating the
attack.
   Samuel Evans of Manhattan allegedly took the transcript before
leaving his job Feb. 5. He then gave the transcript to an
unidentified person, who notified authorities.
   On Wednesday, Evans attempted suicide by downing a quart of
rubbing alcohol and other chemicals in his apartment, said New York
City police spokesman Raymond O'Donnell. He was listed in good
condition after having his stomach pumped.

   Contra rebels damaged a microwave
repeater tower in northern Nicaragua overnight, cutting off
telecommunications with northern Central America and Mexico, the
Defense Ministry said Wednesday.
   The brief defense statement said the tower was at Mesa de las
Lagunas, outside the provincial capital of Esteli, 90 miles north
of the capital of Managua. It did not say how the rebels damaged
the tower or give other details.
   In Guatemala City, Bosco Matamoros, a spokesman for the
U.S.-backed rebels, said the Contras blew up the tower at 1 a.m.
Wednesday.
   ``Nicaragua is isolated,'' he said. The Contras, he said, want
to hinder communications between the country and the rest of
Central America.
   Nicaragua could communicate by microwave with Panama and Costa
Rica but not with Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and Mexico.
Satellite communications were not affected.
   The rebels blew up a microwave repeater tower last October at
Laguna de Santa Clara, east of Esteli, and destroyed another one in
November at Las Cuchillas hill in Chontales province, 90 miles east
of Managua. That sabotage also caused widespread outages.
   The rebels have been fighting for more than six years to oust
the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua. The Sandinistas
came to power in July 1979 at the end of a revolutionary war that
ended 42 years of rule by the rightist, pro-American Somoza dynasty.

   An airline ticket agent suspicious about a
man carrying two big suitcases for a three-hour visit to Michigan
tipped off police Wednesday to what turned out to be an $11 million
cocaine bust, authorities said.
   The man, who was arrested after his plane's arrival here, had
bought a round-trip ticket in Los Angeles from the United Airlines
agent, said narcotics Detective Lt. Gene Wriggelsworth.
   ``He paid cash for his tickets,'' Wriggelsworth said. ``He fit
the drug smuggling profile.''
   The detective said 14 kilos, or about 30 pounds of cocaine, were
confiscated, ``the biggest we've ever had.''
   A drug-sniffing dog was ready when the flight landed at Capital
City Airport for the scheduled three-hour visit and singled out two
large suitcases, Wriggelsworth said
   Police then watched as the man claimed the suitcases and met two
people. All three were arrested, and a car and $4,000 in cash were
confiscated with the cocaine.
   The three were being held in the Clinton County jail on
drug-possession charges. Their names were not released.
   The name of the United agent was not immediately available.

<HEAD>Montreal Policeman Acquitted in Killing of Unarmed Black Teen-Ager</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury on Wednesday acquitted a police officer
of manslaughter in the shooting death of an unarmed black teen-ager
last year, a case that sparked accusations of racism in the
Montreal police department.
   The Nov. 11 shooting of 19-year-old Anthony Griffin had prompted
three inquiries _ by the Quebec Human Rights Commission, the Quebec
Police Commission and the 4,500-member Montreal police force.
   A black community leader, Ronald Rock, said Wednesday that
blacks will march in the streets following the acquittal of
Constable Allan Gosset, 38, a 16-year veteran of the department.
   Gosset, who said the shooting was accidental, rolled his eyes,
sighed and slumped in his chair when the all-white jury of seven
men and five women handed down the verdict after deliberating 16{
hours. The trial lasted four days.
   Griffin's mother, Gloria Augustus, wept as she left the
courtroom, and exclaimed: ``You want us to trust the justice
system? What kind of a justice system do we have?''
   Rock, executive director of the Black Community Council of
Quebec, said, ``I'm very disappointed. This has set relations with
the Montreal police back 15 years. We're going to have to hit the
streets again.''
   Gosset said he will have to await Police Chief Roland Bourget's
decision on whether he will return to work.
   ``I think I should be reinstated,'' he said.
   Griffin was brought to a police station in a patrol car by
Gosset and his partner last November, according to testimony. He
bolted in the parking lot but obeyed Gosset's shouted order to stop.
   Griffin turned around and Gosset shot him once in the forehead
with his .38-caliber service revolver, testimony showed.
   Gosset said Griffin turned to face him, went into a crouch and
began weaving from side to side. Gosset said he feared Griffin
planned to confront him so he drew his gun to intimidate him and it
went off, although he did not recall cocking it.
   Defense lawyer Serge Menard told the jury it was obvious
Gosset's actions were not motivated by racism, because Griffin was
being detained on the basis of an arrest warrant.
   Crown prosecutor Rene de la Sablonniere said Gosset was
irresponsible and should not have pulled his gun because his life
was not in danger.
   On Wednesday, Griffin's mother told reporters she was ``shocked
and saddened'' by the verdict and promised to pursue the case.
Lawyers for the family said they filed a wrongful-death lawsuit for
$850,000 Tuesday against Gosset, the police department and
Montreal's regional government.
   Most of Canada's estimated 400,000 blacks are West Indian
immigrants. The largest black communities are in Toronto and
Montreal.

   Leaders of 100 minority students occupying
a Hampshire College building handed the school's president a list
of demands Wednesday and settled in for what they predicted would
be a long siege.
   ``We're a little disappointed. They wouldn't even talk to us,''
said Dean of Students Trey Williams after a morning meeting with
the protesters was cut short.
   ``We felt that they needed to take time to look at the
demands,'' responded Anita Fearman, a student from Los Angeles and
a protest leader. Another meeting was scheduled for Thursday.
   Some 50 black, Hispanic, Asian, Indian and other students, or
nearly half the minority student population at the 1,100-student
private liberal arts college, took over Dakin House on Tuesday to
protest what they described as the administration's indifference to
their longstanding complaints.
   Another 50 minority students from nearby Smith, Amherst, and
Mount Holyoke colleges and the University of Massachusetts joined
the protesters Wednesday, said Ms. Fearman. UMass was the site of a
similar protest that ended last week.
   About 300 sympathizers, most of them white, accompanied the
negotiators to the meeting with administrators Wednesday in a
library building, where the demands were given to President Adele
Simmons.
   The crowd marched through classroom and administration buildings
on the way, chanting, ``Racism has got to go.''
   A protest leader, Penny Predmas, predicted: ``This is going to
take a while.''
   Among the dozen demands of the group, Students of
Underrepresented Cultures, were calls for money for Third World
speakers and publications, the hiring of a racial harassment
officer and the drafting of a racial harassment policy.
   Williams, who is black, said school officials were worried that
students might be seeking attention rather than results by delaying
negotiations.
   ``Usually building takeovers are the last resort,'' he said. ``I
don't know why the students feel they have no other recourse.''
   The takeover followed the six-day occupation of a building at
nearby UMass. That occupation by 125 students ended Feb. 17 with an
agreement to increase minority recruitment at the 25,000-student
campus.
   ``The problems (at Hampshire) are the same, although the sizes
of the minority communities are different,'' said Ms. Fearman.
``There's a general feeling here that we've been more or less
pushed under the rug.''
   Dakin House contains living quarters for two staff members, an
office and meeting space used by minority students. The staff
members are being allowed to use their living quarters during the
occupation.

   A free-lance writer from Oregon paddled
his teakwood boat into Bangkok Wednesday, the 55th day of his solo
exploration of the effect of rivers on Thailand's history and
culture.
   Two dozen Thais greeted an exhausted and tanned Steve Van Beek,
offering him food and soda as he pulled into a pier near the foot
of the Memorial Bridge.
   Van Beek, 43, of Portland, Ore., said he expected to complete
his nearly 600-mile journey on Saturday, when he is scheduled to
reach the Gulf of Thailand at Samut Prakarn province just southeast
of Bangkok.
   Van Beek paddled his 11{-foot-long boat by day, seeking shelter
with local residents at night and listening to their stories of the
river and its effect on their lives. He sampled what he called a
``whole new experience'' of food, including raw fish with rice,
pig's blood and boiled eel.
   He said the beauty of the countryside and the hospitality of the
Thai people have impressed him.
   ``How many other places could you walk up to someone and say,
`I'm paddling a boat. I need something to eat, a place to stay,
something to eat in the morning,''' he said. ``These people, they
just opened up their entire houses.''
   Water, he said, ``permeates every aspect of life in Thailand. It
is in rites of passage, festivals. Fish and rice are both grown in
water, and they are the principal sources of food here.''
   ``I lived on the edge of the river for 11 years,'' he added. ``I
always wondered where it came from, so I decided to go find out.''
   Van Beek hired a village builder to fashion the flat-bottomed
boat.
   He started his trip in Meaja, about 60 miles north of the
provincial capital of Chiang Mai. He followed the Ping river south
through five provinces, after which it joined the Chao Phraya river.
   Van Beek spent three years in a village in Nepal as a Peace
Corps volunteer before arriving in Thailand in 1969. He worked on
English-language newspapers and magazines before 1977, when he
became a free-lance writer and film maker specializing in
Thailand's art, history and culture.

<HEAD>Man Found Guilty Of Manslaughter In Snakebite Death of Toddler</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. GEORGE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man was convicted of manslaughter
Wednesday in the snakebite-death of a girl around whose shoulder he
had draped a rattlesnake.
   District Judge J. Philip Eves announced the verdict against
Darrell Wessendorf in the non-jury trial.
   Wessendorf, 24, had been charged with second-degree murder in
the death last year of 21-month-old Stevie LuRen Kirkwood of La
Verkin. He had pleaded innocent by reason of insanity.
   The judge said that he found Wessendorf guilty of the lesser
charge because the defendant hadn't been aware of the possible
results of his actions.
   Wessendord, who was renting an upstairs apartment from the
child's mother, Jeri Ann Kirkwood, at the time, testified that he
found the 5-foot rattlesnake on a road and was trying to show the
girl that that it would not hurt her.
   He said he had partially wrapped the snake around the child's
shoulder when Mrs. Kirkwood entered the room and screamed, causing
him to flinch and the snake to bite the child.
   Sentencing was set for April 11. Manslaughter carries a one- to
15-year sentence. Second-degree murder would have brought five
years to life.
   Defense attorney J. MacArthur Wright had claimed that only 0.2
percent of those bitten by rattlesnakes die and called on the judge
to ``make a distinction here on what constitutes a grave risk of
death.''
   ``People bitten by rattlesnakes are often not even treated,'' he
said.
   Prosecutor O. Brent Rowe argued that Wessendorf's actions were
intentional and malicious.
   Earlier Wednesday, a psychologists, George Dunford, said that
Wessendorf suffered from mild schizophrenia and that he did not
believe the defendant understood he was endangering the child.
   An expert on snakes, James Glenn, testified for the defense that
the snake is one of the least aggressive types of rattlers and that
the hospital did not give the girl enough anti-venom.

<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Col. Ali Saibou, military ruler of
Niger, has granted what amounts to a pardon for people who
attempted two coups against his predecessor.
   The pardon took the form of a general amnesty for those
convicted of crimes against state security, according to broadcasts
Wednesday by the West African country's official radio.
   Such an amnesty would free officers and civilians involved in
attempted the coups against Maj. Gen. Seyni Kountche, who died in a
Paris hospital Nov. 10 of what was believed to be a brain tumor.
The radio said the amnesty bars those released from holding
government jobs except after official review.
   Excluded from the pardon was Amadou Oumarou, a wealthy
businessman and former close adviser of Kountche, who failed in a
third coup attempt Oct. 6, 1983. He was said to be living in
Belgium.
   Most of the plotters and other political prisoners are held in
the arid northeastern part of the country or exiled to their
villages, and some fled the country. The radio did not say how many
people were involved.
   In January, Saibou granted a partial amnesty to military
personnel convicted of lesser crimes, except for those who violated
``morality and honor,'' an apparent reference to convicted coup
plotters. The January decision also commuted to life imprisonment
all death sentences announced before 1988.
   Hamani Diori, Niger's first president after independence from
France in 1960, was given his freedom from house arrest early in
1987. Kountche overthrew Diori, now in his 80s, in 1974.
   Niger, part of the drought-stricken Sahel region, is one of the
world's poorest countries with a population of 6 million and a per
capita annual income of about $250. The government said in January
it needed 274,000 tons of grain to avoid food shortages for 1.4
million people.

   Health officials Wednesday battled
an outbreak of disease after rains, floods and mudslides killed at
least 277 people in Rio de Janeiro State.
   The Rio State Health Secretariat is promoting a vaccination
campaign against tetanus, hepatitis, typhoid fever and
leptosipirosis caused by rats and contaminated water.
   The most serious outbreak was of leptospirosis, an infection
caused by rat urine and droppings in water. The often fatal disease
produces high fever, vomiting, diarrhrea and sometimes paralysis of
the kidneys.
   The Health Secretariat said Wednesday that 223 cases of
leptospirosis had been registered, with 15 deaths. Most victims
were from the low-lying slums north of Rio hit hardest by the
flooding, which began Feb. 2.
   Health workers urged people to boil drinking water and use
chlorine to treat water stored in cisterns. Rio residents were
urged not to walk barefoot through flood water, because the disease
can be contracted through tiny cuts and breaks in the skin.
   Foreign countries have donated or pledged about $2 million in
money, food, medicine and equipment. Japan promised to send
vaccine. West Germany planned to donate 1 million disposable
syringes and needles and $300,000, civil defense officials said.
   Rescue workers kept digging for bodies in mud and rubble left by
a violent downpour that began Friday and lasted three days. At
least 81 Rio residents were killed by floods and mudslides in the
past three weeks.
   Firemen and civil defense workers recovered a 12th body from the
ruins of a hillside clinic for the elderly that collapsed under a
mudslide. Officials say 15 more bodies could still be under the
tons of mud and concrete.
   President Jose Sarney visited the worst hit regions Tuesday and
allocated $2 million for repairs. But Rio Mayor Roberto Saturnino
Braga said the city would need at least $100 million.
   In Washington, the State Department on Wednesday suggested that
Americans planning trips to Rio consider postponing travel there,
though no formal travel advisory was announced.

   A mixture of cleaning chemicals
sent fumes through a school Wednesday, sickening at least 149
people, most of them students, authorities said.
   A 12-year-old girl with a history of respiratory ailments was
admitted to Holy Family Hospital in Des Plaines for observation,
said spokesman Frank Buccitelli. The other victims were treated at
hospitals and released.
   Most of those affected by the fumes at Thomas Junior High School
complained of dizziness, nausea and shortness of breath.
   ``Maintenance men were cleaning a drain,'' said police Cmdr. Jay
Plaisted. ``They used a degreaser and a drain opener, and the two
together gave off a noxious odor.
   ``They opened a window to try to air out the fumes, but the
mixture had already moved through the pipes into other rooms in the
school,'' Plaisted said.
   Before noon, state environmental officials declared the school
safe and classes resumed for most of the 700 students, said
Assistant Principal Al Swanson.

the women hit the streets to find Skog, she said.

<HEAD>With AM-SAfrica-Ban, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's government and opposition leaders
condemned South Africa's crackdown on major black organizations
Wednesday and feared the move would bring the ``frustration and
despair'' that breed violence.
   Britain, the staunchest opponent of sanctions against South
Africa, faced renewed demands from the opposition Labor Party and
the Anti-Apartheid Movement organization that Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher approve tough embargoes against South Africa.
   Neil Kinnock, Labor Party leader, said the Thatcher government
``bears a heavy responsibility,'' for the South African government
ban on political activity by 18 major black movements opposed to
apartheid, including the United Democratic Front.
   ``Because it has been so weak against apartheid, we now have
even more vicious jackboot rule,'' Kinnock said.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said he was ``shocked and
saddened'' by the crackdown.
   ``We do not see how the suppression of non-violent political
activity can possibly contribute to a peaceful solution to South
Africa's problems,'' Howe said in a statement, describing the ban
as ``oppressive.''
   ``We are particularly concerned that the black opposition in
South Africa should not lose hope of peaceful fundamental change.
Frustration and despair breed violence,'' Howe added.
   Sir Shridath Ramphal, secretary-general of the Commonwealth,
called on the international community, particularly Western
countries opposed to sanctions, to show South Africa ``in every
possible way ... that this repression is as intolerable as
apartheid.''
   Mrs. Thatcher regularly has been isolated at summits of the
Commonwealth, the 48-nation association of Britain and its former
colonies, for her refusal to impose tough embargoes against South
Africa, a major trading partner.
   The Anti-Apartheid Movement planned demonstrations at the South
African Embassy and said it would join other groups in an
``international demonstration.''
   Anti-Apartheid Movement president, Anglican Archbishop Trevor
Huddleston, said South Africa ``is once again prohibiting
non-violent resistance to apartheid and has slammed the door on any
prospect of genuine negotiation.''
   ``Britain and South Africa's other major trading partners must
act decisively,'' Huddleston added, saying he would appeal again to
Mrs. Thatcher to change her stance on sanctions.
   Mrs. Thatcher argues that harsh sanctions against South Africa
will harden white resistance to change, harm blacks most, and be
evaded by third party countries which are not now big trading
partners.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Thousands March in Scotland As Health Workers Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of health workers
marched in Scottish cities Wednesday as part of a one-day walkout
by 60,000 workers at hospitals nationwide, police and union
officials said.
   The Scottish Trade Unions Congress called the strike to protest
a government plan to force state-run hospitals to compete
competitively with private bidders for auxiliary services.
   About 15,000 workers marched in Glasgow and 10,000 in Edinburgh,
police said. They estimated about 60,000 people took part in the
walkout.
   A union spokesman said rallies were also held in Dundee,
Aberdeen, Inverness, Lochgilphead and Dumfries.
   Union officials said all hospitals remained equipped to give
emergency services, but government officials alleged that even
those services were not being provided in some areas.
   Michael Forsyth, the British lawmaker responsible for health
care in Scotland, said in a radio interview with the British
Broadcasting Corp. that he was ``disgusted'' at the lack of care
available.
   He said he would talk with the strikers when ``they stop
organizing attacks on the sick and stop organizing disruption in
our hospitals.''
   The situation caused an angry clash between opposition and
government lawmakers in the House of Commons in London.
   Conservatives shouted ``disgraceful!' in response to remarks by
the opposition party's spokesman for Scotland, Donald Dewar, that
the protest was justified.
   Scottish Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said the strike ``has led to
operations being canceled in their hundreds, and it will
undoubtedly add to waiting lists over the weeks and months to
come.''
   Health workers have staged regional walkouts recently, but
Tuesday's action was the first nationwide protest.
   Forsyth said the government would not changes its plans, saying
the strike pointlessly damaged the National Health Service, which
provides free health care to Britons.
   The Scottish action follows the Feb. 3 walkout by nurses in
London to demand higher pay and more government funding of the
health service. Automakers and teachers also staged separate
strikes this month.

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Mexican officials pledged to
exchange more tariff and investment information during talks that
reviewed a trade agreement last year, the newspaper El Nacional
announced Wednesday.
   But the two sides reached no new concrete agreements during
talks Monday and Tuesday, officials said.
   ``We held informal discussions, nothing more,'' said a U.S.
official close to the talks, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``They never were intended to be negotiations.''
   El Nacional, citing attending Mexican officials, said the two
sides ``agreed to establish a greater flow of more precise and
opportune information in tariff and foreign investment matters.''
   The two nations trade about $30 billion worth of goods and
services.
   The U.S. delegation, led by deputy trade representative Peter
Murphy, met with its Mexican counterpart, headed by Foreign Trade
Undersecretary Luis Bravo Aguilera, at the resort of Cocoyoc, south
of Mexico City.
   Under the Nov. 6 pact, Mexican and U.S. officials will meet
periodically to review progress made in foreign investment,
services, patents and copyrights, textiles, steel, electronics,
agricultural products and information exchanges.
   The U.S. trade representative and Mexican Commerce Department
reached separate agreements on steel, shoes, beer and textiles late
last year.
   The textile accord, signed by Presidents Reagan and Miguel de la
Madrid at their Feb. 13 summit meeting in Mazatlan, permits Mexico
to increase such exports to the United States by about 6 percent
each year. In turn, Mexico is opening its domestic market to many
finished U.S. textile products for the first time.
   On other issues, the two sides remain far apart. The United
States has pressed for Mexico to liberalize its foreign investment
law, generally restricted to 49 percent of ownership in Mexican
enterprises.
   Mexico has resisted tampering with the law, but it did set up
task force to look at the issue.
   Another point of friction is Mexico's law on patents and
copyrights, which U.S. officials consider too weak to permit
American manufacturers _ particularly in pharmaceuticals _ to
export much to Mexico.
   The United States, Mexico's largest trading partner, takes in a
third of Mexico's exports and provides about the same percentage of
its imports. Mexico ranks fourth as a trading partner with its
northern neighbor, after Canada, Japan and West Germany.

<HEAD>Lawyer Says Nasser's Son Will Attend His Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of former President Gamal Abdel
Nasser of Egypt will return to Egypt to stand trial, a lawyer was
quoted as saying Thursday.
   President Hosni Mubarak said terrorism allegations against
Khaled Abdel Nasser will not tarnish the image of the late
president.
   The daily Al Ahram newspaper quoted Ahmed el-Khawaga, head of
the Egyptian Bar Association, as saying the younger Nasser, 38,
would return to Cairo as soon as the trial starts. The report
appeared in the newspaper's early Thursday edition.
   El-Khawaga made his comments after returning from meetings with
Khaled Nasser in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, where the younger Nasser and
his family live.
   No date has been set for the trial.
   Khaled Nasser and 19 men were charged last Thursday in
connection with four shootings between 1984 and 1987 that killed
two Israelis and wounded six others and two Americans.
   He and 10 other defendants face a death sentence. Eight
defendants face a maximum life imprisonment.
   El-Khawaga was not at his office and there was no answer at his
home when The Associated Press tried to obtain further information
about his four reported meetings with the younger Nasser.
   In his first public comment on the indictment, Mubarak said
Khaled Nasser's alleged involvement in the attacks ``will not
affect the name and history of leader Gamal Abdel Nasser, whom
Egypt respects and loves and whom the whole world, including the
Arab world and our African continent, also loves.''
   Mubarak spoke at a closed meeting with senior officers of
Egypt's 2nd and 3rd armies, both stationed in the Suez Canal zone.
His remarks at the canal city of Ismailiya were distributed
Wednesday by the state-owned Middle East News Agency.
   Egypt has said it is attempting to have Khaled Nasser extradited
to stand trial.
   Another defendant is Gamal Shawky Abdel Nasser, a nephew of the
late president. He is also at large, but he faces lesser charges.
   Nasser, who died in 1970, became president of republican Egypt
in 1956, four years after leading a bloodless military coup that
overthrew the monarchy.
   A champion of Arab unity and an inspiration to numerous African
and Arab liberation movements, he still is revered in much of the
Arab world and in many African countries.

   A worldwide nuclear warning system was
tested without a hitch Wednesday after an earlier one sparked
unfounded fears of a second serious nuclear accident in the Soviet
Union.
   During the test, attended by reporters, a nuclear plant in West
Germany transmitted routine meteorological data to the Vienna-based
International Atomic Energy Agency.
   Sixteen countries taking part in the test confirmed within 30
minutes that they received the information. Agency officials hailed
the test as a success of the sophisticated new warning system.
   The system has become extremely important after the Cherbobyl
nuclear accident, said Morris Rosen, nuclear safety director for
the agency.
   A test of the warning system earlier this month was
misinterpreted, prompting momentary fear worldwide of a nuclear
accident in the Soviet Union.
   The warning system, called the Global Telecommunication System,
can be picked up at 160 points throughout the world, mostly
national meteorologcal centers. It receives information from
nuclear reactors worldwide and is expected to become fully
operational this summer.
   The April 26, 1986, accident at the nuclear reactor at
Chernobyl, about 80 miles north of Kiev, was the world's worst
nuclear reactor accident. It killed 31 people, hospitalized
hundreds and sent a cloud of radiation around the world.

   A 16-month-old-girl was in extremely
critical condition Wednesday after being bitten by a swarm of ants
in her back yard, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Tiffany Cheatham had stopped breathing after the attack but was
revived by rescuers who arrived at her home Tuesday in Navarre, 20
miles from here, said James Chalmers, an emergency medical
technician.
   A witness said a dog had knocked the girl into an ant bed,
according to Chief Don Van Derryt of the Holley-Navarre Fire and
Rescue Association.
   ``There were ants all around all of us,'' said Janet Streaker, a
neighbor who tried to help the child's mother, Lynn Cheatham,
remove the insects. ``The mother is full of ant bites herself.''
   She said Ms. Cheatham took off the child's clothing and put her
in the bathtub to try to wash off the ants, which were entangled in
the girl's hair.
   ``There were lots of them,'' she said. ``There are still ants in
the bathroom.''
   Ann Papadelias, a Sacred Heart Hospital spokeswoman, said that
she suspected the girl was attacked by fire ants, known for painful
and sometimes deadly stings, but that she was unable to confirm
that with doctors.

   A secret presidential report on the
sex-for-secrets spy scandal at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow says the
American ambassador, his staff, and State Department officials in
Washington must share the blame along with the Marines.
   The report describes a ``seedy, disgraceful'' embassy marked by
confused policies, lax supervision and ``gross neglect'' of
counterintelligence efforts.
   President Reagan ordered the study last spring after sensational
reports that Marines sold secrets for sex and allowed Soviet agents
into the building. The State Department has refused to release the
report to the public.

   People who receive transfusions face a one in
40,000 chance of receiving AIDS-tainted blood despite screening
intended to keep the blood supply clean, according to a federal
study published today.
   The researchers emphasize that despite this ``remote but real
risk,'' people who need transfusions should not be deterred from
receiving them.
   ``The blood supply is relatively safe, dramatically safer than
it was before we had any screening,'' said the chief author of the
report, Dr. John W. Ward of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta.

   The U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating
medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe will cost hundreds of
millions of dollars to verify and an additional investment of
billions more for non-nuclear weapons, the nation's top civilian
and military defense officials warn.
   The Pentagon is seeking $198 million this year and another $148
million in fiscal 1989 to ensure verification against Soviet
cheating, according to Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci.
   That money will go for a variety of costs, including the on-site
inspections which are a key feature of the strictest verification
standards in the history of nuclear arms control, Carlucci told the
House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday.

   If it didn't hurt so much, you might be able to
step back and appreciate what critics are citing as a monumental
example of man's folly _ the tax system.
   But for most people it probably does hurt too much to look,
since they are involved deeply, intricately, confusingly, often
desperately and frequently bizarrely.
   Consider: It is entirely possible, says Professor Robert Doyle,
for a taxpayer to be actively rather than passively involved in a
real estate matter that, by official definition, is a passive
activity.
   A few days ago the Internal Revenue Service tried to explain the
riddle, but it is difficult to believe it succeeded in doing much
more than adding to the confusion of those who seek to understand.
   Such anomalies aren't uncommon. The latest tax law, for
instance, is said to be fairer and simpler. It is neither, says
Doyle, who helps train chartered financial analysts at the American
College in Bryn Mawr, Pa.
   Americans have been ``mugged,'' he says.
   Doyle's comment is one of an almost infinite list of criticisms
by an almost endless number of critics, including taxpayers,
philosophers, historians and authorities on taxes who previously
had thought they were experts.
   Among the criticisms:
   _Many members of Congress didn't even understand what they had
done in passing the latest tax bill, having bothered to read only a
small part of it.
   _There has been almost no ``tax policy'' in recent years. In the
span between 1964 and 1984, Congress enacted 16 major tax bills and
dozens of lesser bills.
   Example: The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 promised
corporate tax reductions averaging $51 billion in the years 1987 to
1989. But by 1986, says the Tax Foundation, this reduction had
become a $20 billion-a-year increase.
   _Under the latest tax laws, individuals are responsible for
adjusting their withholding statements in order to avoid
underwithholding. In 1987, millions didn't. The Internal Revenue
Service forgave most of them.
   As a consequence, those who had fulfilled their responsibilities
were put at a disadvantage: They lost the use of the withheld
money. Those who failed in their responsibility were rewarded by
having the money to use.
   _In some instances, ``unearned income,'' such as dividends,
continues to be treated differently from ``earned income,'' despite
the wailing of those who saved their earnings to invest, and
thereby earn ``unearned income.''
   _Nobody knows the answers. Varying interpretations of the same
information are made by professional tax preparers and even by
Internal Revenue Service personnel. As a result, similar tax
returns are treated differently.
   In the view of many critics, the decades of amending,
rescinding, revoking, reimposing, reconciling and correcting could
be adding up to something far more serious than confusion. It
could, they say, undermine faith.
   That undermining could also be widespread. It could, many
believe, destroy faith in the tax system and encourage tax evasion.
But worse, it could endanger confidence in government altogether.
   What can be claimed for the tax system is that it has produced
an industry that seems destined to continue growing, perhaps even
while other businesses are fighting to remain solvent during times
of recession.
   Billions of dollars each year go to accountants, attorneys, tax
preparers, investment advisers, tax-guide publishers and others
whose products and services are deemed necessary by taxpayers.
   How much the industry contributes to the productivity and
well-being of Americans is another matter.

   ``You don't tug on Superman's cape.''
   _ Jim Croce.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You don't make fun of truth, justice and the
American way, but, seriously folks, how do you do a documentary on
Superman with a straight face?
   ``Superman's 50th Anniversary: A Celebration of the Man of
Steel,'' airing Monday on CBS, is a charming, gentle poke at the
superhero, tinged with a hint of lingering childhood awe. Superman
arrived on Earth from Krypton in Action Comics in February 1938.
   Host Dana Carvey of ``Saturday Night Live'' takes viewers
through a 1-hour comic documentary that pretends the Man of Steel
is a real guy and Metropolis a real town _ albeit one that looks
suspiciously like New York.
   Some of the original Superman players are featured. Announcer
Jackson Beck _the guy who originally said, ``Look! Up in the sky!''
_ does the show's opening narration.
   A lovely Noel Neill, who played Lois Lane, is interviewed as
Lois' mother. She complains that no one was ever good enough for
her daughter after Superman. ``I've tried to fix her up with other
men, but it's always, `Can he break through walls? He is
bullet-proof?'''
   There are straight interviews with Jack Larson, who played cub
reporter Jimmy Olsen and is now a movie producer, and Kirk Alyn,
the first superman, in the movie serials that ran from 1948 to 1950.
   ``I felt I was a creator. I created it, I made him look like
this, I made him strong, and they believed me,'' Alyn says proudly.
The late George Reeves was the most famous Superman, starring in
the television series of the 1950s.
   Footage of Superman through the decades, up through Christopher
Reeve, is interwoven with new ``interviews,'' like the one with
syndicated columnist Jimmy Breslin, who worked for the Daily
Planet's competitor.
   ``I'd have to say that Perry White made all the right moves,''
Breslin says of his rival's editor. ``He's got a very streamlined
staff. What has he got? Essentially three reporters.''
   Hal Holbrook has a new one-man Broadway show, we're told. He is
interviewed backstage _ in his distinguished gray hair and blue
tights.
   And thugs sit around in a bar reminiscing about their inability
to resist wasting bullets on the Man of Steel _ ``I just kept
shooting on the chance that one would get through.''
   Ultracool Lou Reed, wearing shades and puffing on a butt, is
interviewed on a street corner: ``Superman? I liked him better
before when he was more subtle. ... Now he's flashier, he's more
into spectacle.''
   We also visit a trailer on the outskirts of town, home of
Superman's ``love child,'' and his mother, played by Jan Hooks of
``SNL.'' Her son, she says, ``has that X-ray vision, but only in
one eye, so he gets these terrible headaches,'' then urges,
``Junior, lift up the Nova.''
   Also appearing in the special are Fred Willard, Peter Boyle, Tom
Davis and Al Franken, Carol Leifer, Brian Doyle Murray, the Amazing
Kreskin and Ralph Nader, among many others.
   The special was produced by ``SNL'' executive producer Lorne
Michaels, ``SNL'' writers wrote it _ one of them, Rosie Shuster, is
coincidentally related to Joe Shuster, one of Superman's creators _
and the producer is Mary Salter, a former producer at ``SNL.'' But
the show hasn't the biting satire ``SNL'' is known for.
   ``I think that we felt we wanted to actually honor the character
and honor everything about the whole comic-book phenomenon and how
this whole sense of a superhero came into being,'' said Salter.
``We didn't really want to go after that satirically, that was
never our objective. ... We wanted to be pretty gentle.''
   ``I think the sense of humor is quite sly and also gentle, so
that it isn't a hard comedy show and doesn't tend to mock Superman
or whatever,'' said Michaels. ``It's just bright and charming and I
think the sort of thing you don't get to do in a special.''
   In the finale, a star-studded crowd awaits the arrival of
Superman at a gala celebration.
   ``I have a plan to destroy Superman at the moment he arrives,''
says the Brainwave (played by writer Robert Smigel), ``but mostly,
I'm here to see the stars.''
   You don't tug on Superman's cape? Well, maybe just a little.

<HEAD>Shearson Says Worst Is Over for Stocks, But What If It's Wrong?</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: John Cunniff is off today. Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The worst is over,'' the investment firm
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. advised last weekend in network
television commercials.
   It followed up this week with full-page newspaper ads that gave
nine reasons why it thinks ``we have seen the lows of this bear
market.''
   ``Pretty gutsy,'' observed Jack Trout, who heads a marketing
strategy firm, Trout & Ries Inc. in New York. But he said if the
market heads south, the ``next headline will have to read, `Oops'.''
   Brokerage firms frequently offer advice and market observations
in newsletters sent directly to clients. But they often make only
general observations about the likely direction of the market in
their advertising.
   Shearson's marketing director, Cathleen Stewart, says the new ad
is another in a series of ``out on the limb statements'' about
market conditions that the firm has put in its advertising in the
past few years.
   For instance, Shearson has incorporated its views on the outlook
for interest rates, the stock market and related issues into
full-page newspaper ads that have appeared at the start of the year
for several years.
   This January, Shearson's 1988 outlook ad said the firm doubted
the economy was facing an economic decline, it didn't expect
another sharp drop in the stock market leading to new lows and it
foresaw a decline in interest rates.
   Two months later, reports indicate the economy continues to
expand, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 100 points from the
end of 1987 and yields on 30-year Treasury bonds are down 0.6
percentage point since Dec. 31.
   But what happens if the firm makes a wrong call?
   ``We are all very clear that if we say something is going to
occur and doesn't, we have to go out in the same way to say so,''
Ms. Stewart said.
   The latest ads come against the backdrop of the Black Monday
stock market crash four months ago. In the wake of the crash,
several large investment firms dashed off ads that were designed

   Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, for instance, put some of
its top executives on the air to reaffirm Merrill's faith in the
underlying strength of the economy and the market. In recent weeks,
Merrill Lynch has begun using several of its brokers in ads
describing what they are telling clients.
   But at the same time, Merrill Lynch completed a new series of
ads that it began working on last spring. The ads, which began
running on the ABC-TV's Olympics broadcasts, talk about the origins

   In one ad, a Merrill employee tells a train conductor about the

he sets out to open a branch office in Milwaukee.
   Shearson is working on new image-projecting advertising that

   But she said both the image advertising and the recent ads

<TEXT>
   Iowa is done. New Hampshire is history. It's on
to Super Tuesday.
   On March 8, voters in 20 states and America Samoa will state
their presidential preferences in the biggest one-day primary
season balloting ever.
   Democrats will choose 1,307 delegates, almost a third of all the
delegates to the national convention in Atlanta. Republicans will
pick 712 delegates, again about a third of the delegates to the GOP
convention in New Orleans.
   To raise the stakes a bit, look at it this way: on Super Tuesday
almost 63 percent of the magic number of delegates needed to win
the nomination will be selected.
   Although 14 of the 20 states are Southern or border states, the
candidates are faced with a disparate set of voters _ from the
textile-and tobacco-dominated Carolinas through booming Georgia and
Florida to the oil-depressed states of Louisiana and Texas.
   Here is a look at how the races are shaping up in each state:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ALABAMA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The race remains cloudy in Alabama, where about 20 percent of
the 2.3 million registered voters are black.
   Republicans have spent little time campaigning for the 38
delegates. Tom Coker, a veteran political organizer who directs the
Business Council of Alabama, said he feels the top three finishers
may be no more than 10 to 12 percentage points apart, with Vice
President George Bush first and former television evangelist Pat
Robertson battling Sen. Bob Dole for second.
   On the Democratic side, much of Jesse Jackson's civil rights
time was spent in Alabama and he has benefited from that
recognition.
   Early polls showed Jackson in the lead with better than 20
percent, followed closely by Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., with
Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt third. But those polls had large
undecided blocs, and it's expected that Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis and Gephardt improved their standing here after early wins.
   Alabama has 56 Democratic delegates at stake.
   Another factor in Alabama is the Democrats' attempt to limit
cross-over voting by adopting a rule preventing anyone from voting
in the Republican presidential primary March 8 and then coming back
and voting in any Democratic primary in June when state and local
nominees will be chosen. The Republican Party has no similar rule.
   The rule may discourage some generally conservative Democrats
from voting in the Republican primary as they have tended to do in
years past. It also may turn some independent conservative
Robertson voters into Republicans.

<HEAD>AMERICAN SAMOA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The smallest player on Super Tuesday is American Samoa, where
about 300 people are expected to participate in the Democratic
Party caucus that night. The South Pacific territory will send
three delegates to Atlanta.
   Chairman Utu R.M. Sinagege says the caucus will decide whether
delegates will go instructed or uncommitted. ``We would rather wait
to see where the trend is going ... who doesn't make the cut,'' he
said.
   In American Samoa, people don't have to show proof of party
registration to attend a caucus. ``The place is so small, everyone
knows everybody and it would be hard for anyone (who is not
Democrat) to slip into the caucus,'' Sinagege said.

<HEAD>ARKANSAS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Arkansas Republicans expect a large turnout that may benefit
Robertson and hurt Bush, who was ahead early, said state executive
director Dorothy English. She attributes many of the new
Republicans to Robertson's candidacy.
   In all, about 1.2 million Arkansans are eligible to vote March
8, up about 5,000 from 1986.
   About 16 percent of the population is black.
   Democratic executive director Kip Blakely says Jackson and Gore
are the perceived leaders, but he says Dukakis and Gephardt are
gaining strength. ``It looks like a four-man race,'' he said.
   Blakely predicts an average turnout of Democrats, about 450,000
to 500,000 for the primary. However, the turnout of Republicans may
triple or quadruple with 75,000 to 100,000 expected to vote.
   ``I think you're going to see Pat Robertson people crawl out
from under the woodwork,'' Blakely said.
   Arkansas has 38 Democratic and 27 Republican delegates at stake.

<HEAD>FLORIDA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   After Texas, Florida has the biggest chunk of delegates with 136
Democrats and 82 Republicans up for grabs.
   Dukakis has been in Florida early and often. His campaign set up
offices last August with 16 full-time staffers and has added staff
steadily since Iowa and New Hampshire. Phone banks have been
running in all 19 congressional districts.
   Gephardt has successfully raised money here, and is counting on
87-year-old Rep. Claude Pepper, the nation's most popular
Democratic campaigner, to get out the elderly vote, which might
hurt Dukakis.
   Jackson, who boasts six campaign offices in the state, has an
active grassroots organization.
   Gore's main presence has been his father, former Sen. Albert
Gore Sr., who the campaign is using in South Florida retiree areas,
and in conservative northwest Florida.
   Most Democratic officials say the race is too close to call and
polls in the last 10 days generally give Gary Hart, Jackson and
Dukakis the most strength, although Hart's support may be
attributed to name recognition.
   Simon Ferro, a member of the Democratic National Committee, said
that although Florida is a media state, ``you still need an
organization to get the people out and to pass the word.''
   ``Gephardt probably has the weakest organization in Florida but
he does have the endorsements of a number of officials. Whether
they can provide the organization for him, I don't know,'' Ferro
said.
   ``If Dukakis does well, it will prove that money and good, early
organization does pay off,'' said Katharine Kelly, a member of the
state's Democratic Central Committee.
   Bush has the most extensive Republican campaign, running with
five full-time professionals headed by state executive director Ken
Wright.
   Although Robertson continues to outspend Bush, and is considered
strong is some GOP pockets, particularly North Florida, Bush has
enjoyed commanding leads in nearly every poll conducted recently.
   In an effort to catch up, Dole was in Florida last week and
plans later trips.
   The latest registration figures, which are more than 15 months
old, showed Florida with 3.2 million Democrats, including 554,585
blacks, and 2 million Republicans, including 21,716 blacks.
   Cross-over voting is not permitted.

<HEAD>GEORGIA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In Georgia, one of three Southern states to hold a presidential
primary on the same day four years ago, Bush is the acknowledged
leader for the 48 Republican delegates, but uncertainty over
Robertson's ``invisible army'' clouds most predictions.
   On the Democratic side, it's a three-man race among Dukakis,
Jackson and Gephardt@Gore, depending on who's doing the talking.
The state will send 77 committed delegates to the convention in
Atlanta in July.
   ``You have to say Gephardt is the man to beat,'' said pollster
Claibourne Darden, although he said Gephardt has done a poor job of
building on momentum gained in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Dakota.
   Democratic officials see Dukakis, Gore and Jackson as the
leaders.
   Republican party officials say Bush's identification with
President Reagan, his years of campaigning and healthy treasury put
him far ahead.
   Robertson is the wild card, with party officials unsure whether
organizational strength displayed in precinct meetings earlier this
month will translate into votes.
   GOP officials claim Robertson will draw dissatisified Democrats
to their primary, but Democrats disagree and the assertion is
difficult to analyze as the state does not register voters by party
and there are no restrictions attached to voting in either party's
primary.
   Little polling has been done since mid-January when a newspaper
survey showed Bush far ahead in the Republican race. The poll gave
Jackson a solid lead, followed by Hart.
   An estimated 2.6 million people will be eligible to vote,
although exact figures aren't available yet. Blacks account for an
estimated 20 percent of the registered voters.
   In 1984, just over 31 percent of the state's 2.4 million
registered voters participated in the presidential primary, with
684,541 voting Democratic and only 50,793 participating in the GOP
primary.
   But in 1980, Republicans got 200,171 of the 584,951 primary
votes and Lee Raudonis, a former state party chairman currently
working for Bush, predicts the party will almost double that number
this year.

<HEAD>HAWAII</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Even Dukakis workers see Jackson as the leader in Hawaii's
Democratic caucuses.
   ``The way it is standing right now, Jackson is in the lead with
40 percent of the people who will show up,'' said state Rep. Mike
Crozier, Dukakis' state co-chairman. ``The way I see it, it'll be
Jackson, Dukakis and uncommitted,''
   Although Hawaii has about 30,000 Democrats, the usual turnout at
precinct caucuses is between 2,500 and 2,800, allowing the more
than 2,000 additional members signed up by Jackson's campaign to
have a major impact on the results.
   Gov. John Waihee, a Democrat, has urged Hawaii's 28-member
delegation to remain uncommitted.
   ``Our view is that Hawaii can provide the same impetus to
Jackson's campaign that West Virginia did for John F. Kennedy who
was running as a Catholic in a non-Catholic state,'' said Jackson
state campaign chairman Richard Port.
   ``Hawaii has very few blacks, but has a lot of people who look
beyond skin color and look at the man. It's hard to overlook a man
who gets support from people who aren't supporting him because he's
black,'' said Port. Of Hawaii's more than 1 million people, 2.4
percent are black.
   Jackson, the only candidate to visit Hawaii, had the backing of
17 percent of the likely Democratic voters surveyed in a recent
media poll. Hart and Dukakis both got 11 percent with Gephardt and
Sen. Paul Simon each at 8 percent, and Gore at 1 percent.

<HEAD>IDAHO</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Like Hawaii, only Democrats are participating in Idaho on Super
Tuesday as they hold caucuses to select 18 delegates to the Atlanta
convention.
   Few candidates have paid much attention to the state, with Gore
the only visitor.
   Democratic Party officials expect about 10,000 people to
participate in the caucuses.
   Although no polls have been conducted, observers say Dukakis may
have a slim lead, though he may suffer because of attempts by some
party leaders to field an uncommitted delegation.
   Analysts think Dukakis has the inside track because of a
superior organization that includes former Gov. John Evans as
co-chairman.
   ``We regard it as an important statement how he does in these
western states,'' said Dukakis' Idaho campaign director John
Greenfield. ``It will be an indication of his status as a national
candidate.''
   Campaign officials for both Dukakis and Gore say a victory in
Idaho is important in their effort to dispell images as regional
candidates.
   The Republicans will hold a primary May 24 to select 18 of their
national convention delegates. Democrats vote again that day, but
the results don't affect delegate selection.

<HEAD>KENTUCKY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Gore has worked Kentucky harder than any candidate and has been
endorsed by Gov. Wallace Wilkinson. Voter turnout is expected to be
very low _ less than 20 percent of the 1.3 million registered
Democrats _ and Wilkinson's organization should give Gore a lift.
   Jackson, who had a surprisingly strong showing in 1984 party
caucuses, has a strong base of support among the Democrats in a
state with 104,640 registered black voters.
   Gephardt has the backing of popular Louisville Mayor Jerry
Abramson, while Dukakis has been endorsed by former Gov. Martha
Layne Collins.
   Among Republicans, Bush, who has made Kentucky Sen. Mitch
McConnell one of his national campaign chairmen, is considered the
clear front-runner.
   A newspaper poll conducted in late January showed Bush with 44
percent and Dole 25 percent among the 550,000 Republicans.
Robertson, who unsuccessfully challenged a state law prohibiting
voters from changing party registration between elections, was
third with 7 percent.

<HEAD>LOUISIANA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Louisiana, with 41 GOP and 63 pledged Democratic delegates, has
attracted little attention, but officials expect that to change.
   ``I think it's coming in full force. There are a few bumper
stickers around. But they're all going to pick up with their media.
It's going to be mostly radio and television, depending upon their
campaign,'' said state Democratic chairman James Brady.
   Although no polls had been taken, Brady said Gore, Jackson and
Gephardt are the early favorites. Jackson won Louisiana in 1984.
   State Rep. Quentin Dastugue, state co-chairman for Dole,
predicted that Dole would carry four of the state's eight
congressional districts, with Bush getting three and Robertson one.
   Much of early effort has involved voter registration drives,
with Robertson's state director claiming credit for helping to
swell Republican rolls by 6 percent since October.
   However, Rep. Richard Baker, Bush's state chairman, said the
growth was due to widespread GOP efforts designed to warn voters
they would be locked out of the Republican balloting if they
remained registered Democrats.
   ``I think they had made a choice to support a Republican
presidential candidate,'' Baker said.
   Nevertheless the GOP remains drawfed more than 5-to-1 by the
Democrats: of the 2.2 million registered voters, 1.7 million are
Democrats and 328,618 Republican.
   No crossover voting is allowed, and the 185,191 voters who
registered as ``no party'' cannot participate March 8.

   Both races appear close in Maryland, a state that offers a
sizable chunk of delegates: 67 Democrats and 41 Republicans.
   Bush and Dole are the clear GOP leaders; Dole had a 2 percentage
point lead in a mid-February newspaper poll.
   Most of the big-name Republicans back Bush, but Dole has some
organizational support in rural congressional districts.
   The Democratic race has stirred little interest, although it
seems likely Jackson will get about 20 percent of the vote and win
two predominantly black congressional districts that elect 12 of
the delegates at stake election day.
   Dukakis seems to be the overall leader, based on a strong
organization, especially in the voter-rich suburbs of Baltimore and
Washington.
   Gephardt showed well in a newspaper poll; Simon has considerable
grass roots activity in some areas, particularly among school
teachers; and Gore has some organizational support in rural areas
and in portions of the Washington suburbs.
   The state has 1,369,597 registered Democrats, 523,380
Republicans and 155,343 independents. Crossover voting is not
permitted and registered independents are barred from the primary.

<HEAD>MASSACHUSETTS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts, which offers the third-highest number of
delegates on Super Tuesday to Democrats and the fourth-highest to
Republicans, has been virtually ignored in 1988, overshadowed by
the South.
   By all accounts, Dukakis should win a clear majority of votes in
his home state, where he won re-election in 1986 with 65 percent of
the vote. Bush, who was born in Milton, Mass., and won the 1980 GOP
primary here, is considered the GOP front-runner.
   ``I'm not sure that we're going to surprise anybody,'' said Mike
Sentance, the Gore coordinator for Massachusetts. ``The Gore
campaign's focus is on the South, and we are more or less on our
own here, battling this out with sticks and rocks.''
   On the Republican side, Ron Kaufman, the Northeast coordinator
for Bush, was confident about his candidate's prospects, joking
about Bush's roots by saying, ``I think it's important that the
vice president win all six of his home states.''
   ``We're still the underdog in Massachusetts,'' said Dole's state
co-chairman, state Rep. Peter Torkildsen. ``Quite honestly ... if
we're anywhere closer than 20 points it would be a victory of
sorts.''
   The registration period just closed, and no new numbers were
available. David Sullivan, head of the state Elections Division,
said he was hearing from town clerks of a moderate increase in
independent registration. Massachusetts law bans crossover voting
but allows independents to vote in either primary.
   ``That could reflect several things,'' Sullivan said. ``It could
indicate alienation from the parties. It could indicate some
Democrats changing registration to independent so they can vote in
the Republican primary.''

   Jackson and Gore are the front-runners among Mississippi
Democrats, while Bush appears to have a solid lead over Dole and
Robertson among the 1.6 million Mississippi voters likely to go to
the polls on Super Tuesday. Forty Democratic delegates will be
chosen, 31 Republican.
   Polls indicate Jackson, who has made several visits to the state
over the last two years, is running very strong among black voters,
an estimated 37 percent of the electorate.
   A poll taken before the Iowa caucuses Feb. 8 had Jackson the
choice of 34 percent of the voters with Hart at 18 percent and Gore
at 16 percent.
   ``I'd think now it would be Jackson with Gore gaining from what
I'm hearing,'' said state Democratic Party chairman Ed Cole. ``But
that could change too.''
   On the GOP side, the same poll had Bush at 43 percent, Dole at
22 and Robertson at 9, but GOP officials said that was before
Robertson's strong showings in Iowa and elsewhere.
   State voters are free to pick the primary they want to vote in.
   ``In Mississippi, you are what you say you are when you go to
the polls,'' said Randy Patterson, chief deputy to the secretary of
state.

   Super Tuesday is the first presidential primary in Missouri's
history, and about 800,000 people are expected to vote.
   Democrats are banking on favorite son Gephardt to pull down a
majority of the 77 delegates at stake in the primary.
   ``We've had no polls but you have to know the man (Gephardt) is
the front-runner in Missouri,'' said state Democratic Party
Chairman Betty Hearnes. ``We just haven't seen anybody else.''
   Jackson, however, is expected to make a good showing in a state
with 19 percent black voters because Gephardt is not particularly
well-known in western Missouri, away from his St. Louis district.
   Republican leaders say it's a tossup whether Bush or Dole will
come away with a larger share of the 47 GOP delegates at stake.
   ``It's keeping me on tenterhooks,'' said state GOP Chairman
Hillard Selck. ``I would say it's tightsville right now. They know
it's a close battle or they wouldn't be in here shuffling around
like they are. Both have suddenly become quite attentive to
Missouri.''

<HEAD>NEVADA</HEAD>

   A month ago, state Nevada Democratic Chairman Beecher Avants
said the race was a tossup between Dukakis and Gore. Now he says
Gore may hold a slight edge in the March 8 caucuses because of
support from prominent Democrats such as Sen. Harry Reid and former
Gov. Grant Sawyer.
   But he said the race remains close because Dukakis ``has a
fairly decent base among the party regulars _ and they're the
people who show up at the caucuses.''
   Jackson has support among Nevada blacks, who represent about 7
percent of Nevada's registered voters and are mainly Democrats,
Avants says.
   Nevada Republicans held their caucuses Feb. 18, and a straw poll
gave Bush 27 percent, although Robertson backers claimed a victory
by combining their 15 percent with most of a 23 percent undecided
vote.
   There were 145,801 Democrats registered to vote in Nevada as of
early January.

<HEAD>NORTH CAROLINA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   North Carolina is viewed widely as Bush's to lose in the GOP
race. Among Democrats, Jackson's extensive grassroots organization
and solid base of black support may give him a plurality as
Dukakis, Gephardt and Gore fight over the remaining Democratic
votes.
   The state's 82 Democratic delegates and 54 GOP delegates make it
one of the largest pots on Super Tuesday.
   Ted Arrington, University of North Carolina at Charlotte
political scientist and a Republican, says Bush is running first
and Dole second, with Robertson and Kemp fighting it out for third.
   But he said Bush is not a strong first and polls have shown
changing levels of support.
   A newspaper poll in mid-February showed Jackson leading the
Democrats and gaining ground with 21 percent of those polled.
Dukakis was second at 18 percent, Gephardt 13 percent and Gore 11
percent.
   The results were a blow to Gore, who has visited often, been
endorsed by Sen. Terry Sanford and former Gov. Jim Hunt and been
running commercials for weeks.
   Merle Black, political science professor at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said Jackson would get at least 90
percent of the black vote, about 19 percent of registered voters,
and 5 percent to 10 percent of the white vote, leaving Gore,
Dukakis and Gephardt to fight for the rest.
   ``Jackson is in a very enviable position,'' said Wallace Hyde, a
Raleigh fund-raiser and Gore strategist. ``His vote I'd say is
motivated. It's sort of a crusade to his people.''
   The latest figures showed 2.1 million registered Democrats,
850,351 Republicans and 132,421 unaffiliated.
   Spot checks show the GOP is picking up some ground, and state
GOP Chairman Jack Hawke says he's convinced Robertson is behind
much of the growth.
   Crossover voting is not allowed in North Carolina but the GOP
permits independents to vote in its primary. The Democrats do not.

   Gore and Gephardt have been the most visible of Democratic
candidates in Oklahoma, but party officials say the race is wide
open.
   ``Name ID is the name of the game,'' state party chairman Bill
Bullard said. ``I think it could boil down to who is on television
delivering their message the last three days _ Saturday, Sunday and
Monday.''
   Bullard said the winner might have 23 percent or 24 percent of
the vote. It takes 15 percent to pick up any of Oklahoma's 46
delegates at stake.
   Gephardt's call for an oil import fee is playing well in a state
hit hard by the sagging fortunes of the oil industry.
   Bush and Dole are generally considered the leading Republicans,
but some of their supporters are nervous about Robertson and his
draw with many conservative Democrats who have been re-registering
as Republican.
   Tom Cole, state GOP chairman, says he thinks ``any of the three
of them could win.'' Jack Kemp also is well organized, but thus far
political experts see him finishing fourth.
   Dole's strength is partly due to the fact that he is from
Kansas, a neighboring state that is heavily dependent, as is
Oklahoma, on agriculture.
   Matt Seward, Bush campaign coordinator in Oklahoma, says it is
``a neck-and-neck'' race with Dole, downplaying Robertson's
strength despite reports that Robertson supporters got more than 50
percent at February precinct meetings.
   Eighteen of the GOP 36 delegates will be chosen on the basis of
the primary vote in the six congressional districts and Robertson's
best chances are in the heavily Democratic 2nd and 3rd districts of
eastern and southern Oklahoma.
   Oklahoma had 1,356,460 Democrats registered as of Jan. 1,
compared with 616,232 Republicans and 53,933 independents.
   County election officials have reported scores of Democrats have
been switching to GOP to vote for Robertson.

<HEAD>RHODE ISLAND</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Dukakis and Bush, with the support of party leaders and the most
visible organizations, are expected to win Rhode Island, but each
faces some competition for the 22 Democratic delegates and 21 GOP
delegates.
   The Massachusetts governor is a familiar face here, but Rhode
Island Democrats have a history of rejecting the establishment's
choices, picking Hart in 1984 and Jerry Brown in 1976 despite the
opposition of party regulars.
   Gore, whose organization includes a small group of legislators,
and Simon, who is backed by several influential labor leaders, have
made a serious effort for second place.
   Jackson won 8 percent of the vote in 1984, in a state that is
only 2 percent black, but must win 15 percent to qualify for any
delegates.
   Among Republicans, Dole organized the state first, but Bush has
attracted most of Rhode Island's top Republicans, including Gov.
Edward D. DiPrete.
   About 514,000 voters _ there is no party registration _ are
registered for the primary, virtually the same as in 1984. But
since 1976, when the primary was instituted, turnout has averaged
just 10.1 percent.

   Gore is the undisputed champion in his home state, where his
father was also a senator for almost two decades. Only Jackson has
bothered to campaign for the 70 Democratic delegates available and
he has the support of most of the state's blacks.
   The Republican race for 45 delegates is harder to call. Bush has
most of the leading Republican fund-raisers and most prominent
executive committee members backing him, Dole has former Sen. Bill
Brock working for him but Robertson is a wild card.
   Robertson has a strong organization and Bible belt appeal.
   State Republican Chairman Jim Henry said Robertson is ``going to
get 40,000 or 50,000 votes in Tennessee. That will probably give
him a solid third. They've identified 40,000 Robertson supporters.
I expect about 200,000 votes in the Republican primary, about the
same number who voted in '80.''
   Tommy Harper, Bush's Tennessee campaign director said Robertson
``is going to do pretty well,'' battling Dole for second place.
   There were 2,466,220 registered voters at the end of 1987.
   There is no party registration, but estimates are that the state
is about 30 percent Republican, 50 percent Democrat and the rest
independent.

   Texas offers the biggest slice of the Super Tuesday pie, with
183 Democratic delegates and 111 Republican delegates at stake.
   One-time oilman Bush has adopted the state as his home, and
newspaper polls show him well ahead, with Robertson in third but
gaining on Dole.
   Robertson may gain further from a low Republican turnout on
primary day.
   Like many Southern states, Texas does not register by party,
leaving voters free to choose either primary. In addition, Texas
remains a one-party state in many respects, and lots of local
primary races are Democrats only. This may reduce the number of
people who vote in the GOP presidential race, leaving the door open
for Robertson.
   Bush has a solid GOP establishment organization, chaired by
former Rep. Tom Loeffler and endorsed by Gov. Bill Clements.
   Dukakis has won raves for his organization and has moved up to
the lead in at least one poll. Gore, meanwhile, has picked up lots
of establishment endorsements. Gore also has lined up Democratic
fund-raiser Jess Hay of Dallas, who put together a $750,000 night
for him in Dallas Feb. 10. Jackson has his 1984 organization in
place and looks strong in inner city Houston and Dallas.
   Texas has more than 7.8 million registered voters, with final
counts still to be made in four of the biggest counties, including
Dallas and Houston. Registration is up 7.2 percent, boosted by a
high-profile registration drive. The state does not record
registration by race; however, Hispanics probably make up the
largest group of minority voters.
   Secretary of State Jack Rains estimates as many as 1 million
people will vote in each of the primaries on March 8.

   Among Virginia's Democrats, Jackson is ``in the driver's seat,''
said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political analyst.
   ``He's got three strong, white Democrats running against him
(Gephardt, Gore and Dukakis),'' Sabato said. ``If all three of them
stay in contention ... then Jesse Jackson is bound to do well. I
think he's got a good chance to be the plurality winner, but not
the majority winner.''
   Seventy-five of the Virginia's 85 Democratic delegates will be
selected based on the primary results.
   Republicans in Virginia, Robertson's home state, will select 50
delegates through a complicated series of local caucuses and
district and state conventions that are not connected to the March
8 primary.
   Steve Haner, director of the GOP legislative caucus in Virginia,
said a loss by Robertson to Bush in the primary might look bad,
``but after the mass meetings start, reality will set in,'' he said.
   Three months ago, about 1,200 Robertson supporters packed a
western Virginia arena where the state GOP central committee was
meeting. Don Moseley, a member of the committee, said it was ``an
awesome display. Those are very committed people, and they're not
going to go away.''

   Washington has 2.2 million registered voters, but traditionally
no more than 50,000 to 100,000 people attend the precinct caucuses.
Party leaders, who beat back legislation to create a presidential
primary, predict they'll meet or beat the 100,000 mark this year,
particularly with the infusion of Robertson supporters.
   The caucuses are binding on the 65 Democratic delegates but not
for the Republicans. The state has no registration by party. Caucus
attenders attest on a sign-in sheet that they consider themselves
Democrat or Republican.
   Robertson is given a good shot at edging out Dole and Bush,
although more party regulars are predicting Dole, Robertson and
Bush finishing in that order with Kemp trailing. State Party
Chairwoman Jennifer Dunn, who once predicted a Dole victory, now
says the candidates are so bunched up she can't make a prediction.
   Robertson is charging hard, using pastors, fundamentalists and
viewers of his ``700 Club'' show to recruit followers. Party
officials say most of the Robertson supporters seem to be political
neophytes.
   Robertson state Chairman Bruce Hawkins predicts a first- or
second-place finish.
   Both Hawkins and Dole spokesman Brett Bader say it's a
Robertson-Dole race. Dole has targeted Washington more than any
other candidate, going to the state eight times and locating his
western coordinator there.
   On the Democratic side, Dukakis seems to have it sewed up. He's
the favorite of many party regulars and has wooed labor. He made
several visits, more than the others, and appears to be the
favorite of Gov. Booth Gardner.
   Party state Chairwoman Karen Marchioro sees Simon second,
followed by Jackson and Gore. Gephart does poorly in the state,
largely because of his protectionist stance in a staunchly
free-trade state.

   Everything's coming up New York at the 30th
Annual Grammy Awards, as the music industry returns to a town with
a rich legacy of contributions to American song.
   ``We had a couple of choices this year,'' said Ken Ehrlich,
producer of the show. ``We opted to downplay that it's the 30th
anniversary. Instead, we took advantage of what was really unique
to New York. A lot of nominations are New York-based musicians and
New York-oriented songs.''
   The three-hour show will be telecast live on CBS-TV at 8 p.m.
EST on Wednesday from Radio City Music Hall. It is the first time
in seven years that the presentation by The National Academy of
Recording Arts & Sciences will originate from New York instead of
Los Angeles.
   Highlighting the awards extravaganza is a production number
celebrating the sounds of the city, featuring Tito Puente and Celia
Cruz with their hot Latin rhythms; Run DMC with its funky rap; and
Billy Joel, whose songs have traveled from downtown to uptown, from
romantic Greenwich Village bistros to Spanish Harlem.
   ``It's a number that has a lot of different layers and
textures,'' said Ehrlich, who is producing the show for the seventh
time. ``The size and the scope of the city is so big.''
   Guitarist-vocalist George Benson will perform ``On Broadway.''
New York based do-wop groups will do what they do best. Do-wop.
   Jazz legend Miles Davis and sax-man David Sanborn will blow
their horns in the art deco entertainment palace.
   Michael Jackson, Suzanne Vega, Whitney Houston, Terence Trent
D'Arby, Randy Travis, K.T. Oslin, Restless Heart and comedian
Jackie Mason will also perform.
   In the past few years, the Grammy show has struggled for an
upbeat image, moving away from the banalties of middle-of-the-road
pop music. Last year the accent was on blues, gospel and country
music. The year before, Grammy tried jazzing things up with a
tribute to bebop and swing.
   This year the nominees range from the sensuous funk of Prince to
the lyrical charms of Suzanne Vega.
   Fun and love still make major notes, but South Africa, child
abuse and national pride have claimed places on the charts as well.
It seems that listeners are tired of the endless party with its
synthetic orchestrations, and long for real emotions and a touch of
reality backed by raw sounds and solid music.
   U2 sold more than 12 million copies of its Grammy nominated LP,
``The Joshua Tree,'' with its tunes about war and the meaning of
life. Vega's Top 10 hit, ``Luka,'' a soliloquy of an abused child,
has been nominated for record of the year and song of the year, and
she's up for best female pop vocalist.
   Paul Simon also is nominated for record of the year for the
title track from his Grammy award-winning ``Graceland'' LP, which
fused the songwriter's poetry with the rhythms of the black
township of Soweto in South Africa. The Graceland collection won
Album of the Year last year.
   Up for Album of the Year is Prince's ``Sign 'O' the Times,''
with its allusions to drug addiction, destitution and AIDS.
   Though the rock-pop mainstream is serving up serious songs for
serious listeners, frothy feelings still sell: Dolly Parton, Linda
Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris have been nominated for album of the
year for ``Trio''; Grammy winner Whitney Houston is up for her
self-titled ``Whitney'' LP.
   Although women have a strong presence in the three major Grammy
contests, the record academy eliminated the ``best rock vocal
performance, female'' category this year.
   ``I wish the nominations had been otherwise,'' Ehrlich said. ``I
think this has been a terrific year for women in pop music in
general. I would have liked to have had more rock presence.''
   The Grammys have separate categories for male and female singers
in pop and rhythm 'n' blues. The rock category combines them this
year. Tina Turner, who was named best female rock vocalist last
year, is nominated along with Richard Marx, Bob Seger, Bruce
Springsteen and Joe Cocker.
   The sultry singer will not be performing in the telecast,
though, because she's touring in Europe.
   Al Schlesinger, president of NARAS, said the academy has a rule
that the 6,000 industry professionals who are members must nominate
10 people in a category for that category to exist. Rock vocalist
nominations must be from solo albums; lead singers of groups, such
as Grace Slick, aren't eligible.
   This year, NARAS couldn't come up with 10 female nominees for
rock vocalist.
   Other nominees range from such pop veterans as Barbra Streisand
(``One Voice'') and Carly Simon (``Coming Around Again'') to jazz
singer Al Jarreau (``Moonlighting''), rhythm and blues great Wilson
Pickett (``In the Midnight Hour''), country rage K.T. Oslin (``80's
Ladies''), avant-garde rocker Frank Zappa (``Jazz From Hell'') and
comedian Robin Williams (``A Night at the Met'').
   Grammy winners in 73 categories will be determined by balloting
among the record academy members of the record academy in seven
chapters nationwide. Members include recording artists,
songwriters, musicians, producers and technicians.

<HEAD>Honda Accord Continues to Get Raves</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The raves just roll in for the Honda Accord _
they have been for a number of years now _ and I have to add mine.
   What an utter pleasure to drive such a well-designed, well-built
car. It doesn't matter who does the judging: The Accord always
seems to land on top.
   The car has been named one of the 10 best by Car and Driver
magazine for six years _ including the current 1988 model year.
This is the compact sedan that feels right to both import and
domestic buyers, the magazine wrote in its January edition.
   Popular Science was no less laudatory. The Accord is the best
family sedan sold in the United States, the periodical said last
summer. Car buyers also vote in favor of the Accord, having made it
the third-best seller in the last model year, 1987, with sales of
more than 337,000. Only the Ford Escort and Ford Taurus had more
sales.
   Why is the Accord so successful? The 1988 LXi sedan I drove had
excellent fit and finish, one of the best ergonomically-designed
interiors of any car I've been in, a responsive, fuel-injected,
four-cylinder engine coupled with a smooth five-speed manual
transmission and fine handling _ just to mention a few of the major
items.
   But what really shows is Honda's attention to the little things.
For example, there was a small, blue light that illuminated the
ignition keyhole for several seconds after the driver door was
opened and closed _ just to help the driver find the spot for the
key.
   There was a safety on the cruise control. While the set speed
and resume buttons are on the four-spoke steering wheel, the button
to turn on the whole system was on the dashboard to the left of the
driver, so the cruise should not be activated accidentally.
   Below the cassette player was a large center bin to keep
cassettes organized. To the left of the driver was a small, shallow
drawer _ ideal for coins for the parking meter. The driver-side
window would go all the way down if the driver just pushed the
power window button past the first stop.
   I didn't have to continue to hold the button down as I drove.
There was a lock on the other windows, if you have children, and
there were child-proof locks for the rear doors. I could go on. The
Accord simply has a lot of carefully-planned features. Of course,
they don't come cheap.
   The LXi is the top-of-line model and has a base price of
$15,200. You could get a compact Tempo GL four-door for around
$9,000, in contrast. But the Accord price includes a lot of
amenities that are standard, such as a power moonroof with wind
deflector and manual sunshade.
   Consumer Reports rates the Accord highly, with the car's trouble
index _ trouble experience of owners _ much better than average for
the 1982-86 model years.
   However, I had a problem with my test car. The engine warning
light came on while I was on the highway, and I limped the car
(with 2,029 miles on it) back to the garage as instructed by the
owner's manual, which said something may have malfunctioned in the
fuel injection system. Honda spokesman Dave Jenkins said later it
was likely a loose wire, because after checking under the hood, the
garage could not make the light go back on, even after 150 miles of
driving.
   Another drawback in the Accord was the small rear seat. Sure you
can fit three adults back there, but they will sit real close
together. There have been complaints of sudden acceleration in
Honda Accords _ claims that the vehicles took off on the drivers
and the brakes were not effective.
   Honda has not found any widespread defect in the cars involved,
and two federal government probes into the complaints were closed
with no common malfunction found. The Accord attracts a large
percentage of yuppie buyers _ 46 percent are between 25 and 39
years of age.
   Income-wise, the biggest group (18 percent) are buyers with
household earnings of $30,000 to $40,000 a year. More than 70
percent of Accord buyers are married, and more than 80 percent have
some college education. More than 60 percent of the buyers have
professional-manager type jobs, Honda said.
   Officials at many domestic automakers just drool over that kind
of demographics and have spent years trying to get their vehicles
to the Accord's level of quality and comfort _ not to mention
sales. In the cutthroat auto business, that says a lot. Imitation
is, after all, the sincerest form of flattery.

<HEAD>Soviets May Have a Crush on U.S. Soybean Meal, Says USDA Analyst</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decision last fall by Moscow to buy
high-protein soybean meal from the United States is seen by an
Agriculture Department analyst as a significant development for
Soviet consumers and American farmers.
   The sales in November, the first in eight years, totaled 1.3
million metric tons and were worth an estimated $300 million, says
Thomas W. Bickerton of the department's Economic Research Service.
   Overall, the Soviets are expected to import a record 3.2 million
tons of soybean meal in 1987-88, including the U.S. shipments.
   Although the Soviet Union has bought U.S. soybeans from time to
time _ more than 813,000 tons have been sold for delivery this year
_ the huge purchase of meal has special significance.
   Underlying the decision to buy U.S. meal is Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's commitment to reform the agricultural sector,
including greater profitability and more meat for consumers.
   ``The speed at which these two economic goals can be reached
depends to a great extent on how quickly the Soviets can introduce
more protein meal into their livestock sector,'' Bickerton said.
``The most cost-effective way to rapidly increase protein inputs is
to sharply expand imports.''
   Also, he added, by adding the United States to its list of
suppliers the Soviets are able to see more price competition and to
contract for year-round shipments.
   High-protein meal in feed allows livestock and poultry to do
well with less grain than otherwise might be required. Soybeans,
after being crushed into meal and oil, are a prime source.
Cottonseed, sunflowerseed and other oil crops also are important.
   ``More meal in feed rations will allow the Soviets to obtain
greater output of meat and other livestock products at a savings,''
Bickerton said in a report by the agency. ``Soviet per capita meat
consumption is currently only about one-half that of the United
States.''
   Prior to last fall's orders, the Soviet Union last bought U.S.
soybean meal in 1979, just before then-President Carter imposed a
partial embargo on further sales of grain and other commodities in
response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
   After that, Argentina, Brazil and the European Economic
Community shared the Soviet market, exporting an average of 1.2
million tons of soybean meal annually.
   Bickerton said the U.S. sales ``suggest that the Soviets now
feel confident in their ability to handle U.S. meal in large
quantities'' and have created expectations that the Soviet Union
will be a good customer in the future.
   ``The Soviet agricultural sector lacks the resources to produce
sufficient protein to bridge the existing large gap between
domestic protein supply and demand,'' he said.
   In all, Bickerton said that the Soviet Union's livestock protein
deficit is estimated in the range of 9 million to 13 million tons a
year, in soybean meal equivalent.
   Further, he said, Soviet oilseed crushing capacity ``remains
stagnant'' at levels reached in the early 1970s, a factor which may
have encouraged Moscow to buy more meal instead of whole soybeans.
   Another likely reason cited by Bickerton for the Soviet Union
changing its mind about U.S. soybean meal have been the marketing
work done by private trade groups, including the U.S. Soybean
Processors Association and the American Soybean Association.
   Still another factor was the decline in the value of the U.S.
dollar against major foreign currencies, although Bickerton said
this has been limited in the case of soybean meal because of a rise
in meal prices in the international market.
   Bickerton said the large U.S. sales are expected to cut into the
shares of the Soviet market held by competitors.
   In 1986-87, the EEC, Argentina and Brazil divided the Soviet
soybean meal market among themselves, sharing 29 percent, 34
percent and 37 percent, respectively, he said.
   This year, the Argentine and Brazilian shares may drop to a
range of 20 percent to 25 percent each, and the EEC could wind up
with as little as 9 percent of the Soviet meal business, he said.

<BYLINE>By JERRY SCHWARTZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bellows Falls Times described it best:
   ``No paths, no streets, no sidewalks, no light, no roads, no
guests, no calls, no teams, no hacks, no trains, no moon, no meat,
no milk, no paper, no mails, no news, no thing _ but snow,'' the
Vermont newspaper wrote.
   At the time, there were 32 inches of snow on the ground _ but it
was worse than that, because the winds had whipped the flakes into
drifts that blanketed every house in town, covering everything but
the rooftops.
   One two-story drift blocked the entrance to the town's only
hotel. To escape, the adventurous burrowed through a narrow tunnel
dug by hotel workers.
   No thing _ but snow.
   The Blizzard of 1888 arrived on March 11 as a soft, gentle rain
in the last days of winter. No one expected anything more; the
forecasts called for clearing, balmier weather from Washington to
Boston.
   Three days later, the blizzard ended with corpses encased in
snowbanks, telegraph and electric wires tangled, stranded commuters
sleeping on hotel billiard tables, train schedules tossed to the
very considerable winds, and myriad tales of heroism, tragedy,
hilarity, enterprise and outright miracles.
   One hundred years later, the Blizzard of '88 remains frozen in
memory, though its remaining survivors are few. Two new books mark
the storm's centenary _ ``Blizzard! The Great Storm of '88,'' by
Judd Caplovich, and ``The Blizzard of 1888,'' by Mary Cable.
   These books, along with memoirs and newspaper accounts of the
time, depict a world set on its ear by the elements.
   Some estimated accumulations: Saratoga Springs, N.Y., 50 inches;
Bennington, Vt., 48; Blooming Grove, Pa., 31; Pittsfield, Mass.,
36; New Haven, Conn., 45; Dublin, N.H., 42.
   Only 21 inches fell on New York City, but that is a deceptive
total. In many ways, the nation's largest city was hardest hit.
   ``A great white hurricane roared all day through New York
yesterday and turned the comfortable city into a wild and
bewildering waste of snow and ice. ... No one living can remember
such a storm,'' wrote the New York Herald.
   A combination of 19th-century work ethic and fear of firing led
thousands to make their way to their jobs.
   Most of them had to travel on foot; horse-drawn street cars were
abandoned everywhere, elevated trains stalled for hours (one train
slid into another on ice-slickened tracks, killing an engineer),
and cabbies charged as much as $50 a ride _ the equivalent of $600
in 1988. IF they could find the way.
   ``Sa-a-ay Billy! Where in blazes are we?'' said one hack to
another, as the two cabs stood on Broadway near 13th Street.
   ``I'm blankety-blanked if I can see. We're near Union Square
anyway,'' his friend replied, according to the Herald.
   George D. Baremore, a trader in hops, left his home on West 57th
Street and set out for his office at the Battery. He walked to the
Sixth Avenue el, waited for an hour, and then tried to walk to the
Ninth Avenue el.
   He never made it. A day later, a police officer saw a hand
sticking out of a drift on Seventh Avenue. Baremore's frozen body
was buried there.
   The most famous casualty was Roscoe Conkling, political
powerbroker and former U.S. senator from New York. Conkling refused
to pay $50 forthe courts to his home on Madison Square.
   It took him more than three hours to walk 2{ miles; at one
point, he was stuck in a drift for 20 minutes. He collapsed and was
carried to his hotel; by the weekend, he had pneumonia and an ear
infection. He died April 18.
   Those who made it to work found they had little to do. B.
Altman's department store had only one customer all day _ an
elderly woman who braved snow and 50-mph winds to buy two spools of
thread. At Tony Pastor's theater, the eight performers outnumbered
the audience of four. But the show went on.
   Not surprisingly, a fair amount of partying went on. ``The smell
of malt all along the line was almost enough to knock one down,''
one man recalled.
   The entrepreneurial spirit thrived. Shovelers, most of them
immigrant Italians, demanded and got $10 a day. Ladders were toted
to elevated tracks to rescue passengers _ the ladder fee reached $2
per person. The hotels filled, and rented every bit of space _ pool
tables, closets, stairwells.
   Food and coal were in short supply. Provisions, where they could
be found, had to be tossed up through second-story windows. And
where provisions could not be found, New Yorkers made do.
   ``Hundreds of sparrows took refuge under kitchen porches and
were frozen or easily caught and cooked for food,'' one writer
recalls.
   Country folks adapted better; most were amply provisioned, more
accustomed to dealing with the elements, less dependent on modern
conveniences. This is not to say that there were no deaths: In
Milltown, N.J., a man went to get a doctor for his sick wife, lost
his way and froze to death; by the time someone reached the house,
the wife had died.
   In Danbury, Conn., a man stumbled on what appeared to be a body
in the snow. He ran screaming to a saloon; the patrons emerged and
began digging.
   When they finished, they found they had rescued a wooden
cigar-store Indian that had blown over in the storm.
   In Lewes, Del., 25 ships were hurled across the harbor by
gale-force winds. Two vessels sank.
   Hundreds of trains were bogged down in the snow. Food and drink
was procured from local people where possible; when a train was
mired near Brookfield, Conn., the stationmaster managed to scrounge
enough food so that each passenger got an egg and two slices of
bread.
   To pass the hours, some played cards, and others knitted.
Theatrical troupes, stuck en route to engagements, performed in the
aisles; one was touring with a play entitled, ``Lost in the Snow.''
   Signs placed in snowbanks in New York: ``The flowers that bloom
in the snow, ha ha'' (with a bunch of flowers). ``This way to
Canada.'' ``This bliz knocks biz.''
   In the end, 400 people and uncounted numbers of horses and other
livestock died in the blizzard, and damages were estimated at $20
million. A thaw that arrived a few days later brought flooding.
   The blizzard convinced New York and other cities to build
subways. It also pushed utility wires in New York underground,
where they remain.
   As the years passed, some survivors of the blizzard looked back
on those days with fondness. Rose B. Capone of Long Island City,
born during the snowfall, was proud of her middle name: Blizzard.
   Starting in 1929, survivors formed the Society of Blizzard Men
and Women. They met yearly through the 1960s, an ever-diminishing
band of snow veterans who lamented the passing of their personal
Ice Age.
   ``We blizzard survivors are not only organizing to keep alive
the traditions of the storm but we are sick and tired of all this
modernity and want to go back to the days when we New Yorkers lived
simply and got our fun out of simple things,'' said one stalwart
Blizzard Man.

   The great Blizzard of 1888, which claimed 400
lives and buried the Northeast in up to 55 inches of snow, probably
would be less destructive if it occurred in 1988, weather experts
say.
   From Maine to the nation's capital, much of the U.S. population
came to a halt beginning March 11, 1988. By the time the storm
ended, 72 hours after it started, about 400 people were dead, 200
in New York City alone.
   The official weather forecast, issued by the War Department's
Signal Service, had called for brisk winds and fair weather over
the Atlantic states when the brunt of the storm struck.
   Today, classic ``northeasters'' of the type that caused the 1888
storm are easier to predict, with satellite photos and complex
communications able to track the storms as they form in the south
and churn along the Atlantic coast, collecting moisture to dump as
snow in the Middle Atlantic and Northeast states.
   Using satellites and detailed computer models, forecasters today
should be able to give two days warning of such a storm, said
Harlan Saylor, deputy director of the National Meteorological
Center in Camp Springs, Md.
   In addition, he added, federal weather forecasters now work 24
hours a day, every day. In 1888, forecast offices closed on
weekends. On the weekend the blizzard began, the New York
forecaster closed the office on Saturday afternoon.
   Today, too, the effect of even a massive storm like that a
century ago, a storm that buried Troy, N.Y. under 55 inches of snow
and dumped 40 inches on Bennington, Vt., should prove less
dangerous to most Americans, according to weather historian David
M. Ludlum.
   ``One facet is that New York has subways now and people could
get about. The blizzard was one of the reasons that speeded up
building subways,'' he said in a telephone interview from his
Princeton, N.J., office.
   Indeed, trains stuck on New York City's elevated railways posed
a major problem in 1888, with passengers often having to be
evacuated on rickety wind-whipped ladders.
   Judd Caplovich in the book, ``Blizzard! The Great Storm of
'88,'' said the storm prompted many cities to turn to electric
streetcars, instead of the popular horse-drawn versions.
   In another change at least partly spurred by the blizzard,
Ludlum noted that today communications lines are underground.
   ``In 1888, horsepower was the best that was available to clear
snow, now we have motor vehicles, of course,'' he added.
   But, Ludlum said, ``the automobile adds another factor, which
would make things a lot tougher because they can't get around
unless it's plowed.''
   Travel might not be as necessary now, since most people have
refrigerators and freezers to store food and central heating is
available.
   A hundred years ago, city residents lacked convenient food
storage and most city families relied on daily trips to the market
for supplies. Markets depended on regular deliveries to keep stock
in place.
   Farmers often were better off than their city cousins, at least
able to survive the isolation with stored food.
   Adding to the misery was cold, and the fact that for many
families heat depended on a coal stove, replenished by fuel bought
in a daily bucket from now closed and snowed-in stores.
   A century ago workers who missed a day on the job lost pay, and
could well find their place filled by someone else when they did
return _ there was little or no employment security.
   The result was that thousands took to the streets on that
frightening Monday, trudging to jobs or to try and find coal for
heat or milk for the baby _ and for many it was their last trip.
   Today, many businesses _ and even the federal government _ close
at the first hint of bad weather.
   Eventually, Patrick Hughes wrote in the magazine
``Weatherwise,'' the storm ``proved a financial blessing to the
city's poor. Any man or boy able to lift a shovel was able to make
at least double the normal laborer's wages. Street car companies,
street cleaning agencies and many private organizations were giving
work to all at $2 or more a day.''
   Though plows are available today, they still haven't eliminated
the need for the hand-driven shovel.
   Adding to the confusion during the 1888 storm was the lack of
communication as the hurricane-strength winds ripped down overhead
telegraph lines connecting major cities.
   ``Foreign invaders could have come ashore at Annapolis or
Baltimore during the Blizzard of '88. Officials in the nation's
capital would have been unaware and probably unable to do anything
about it,'' Caplovich wrote.
   He noted too that the blizzard brought ``White Monday'' to the
New York Stock Exchange. Only five stocks were traded that day,
volume totaling 15,200 shares. The next day only 2,000 shares
changed hands.
   Today, electronic signals easily pierce clouds and snow to carry
news and financial orders from city to city, unlike 1888 when New
York could still communicate with London via the Atlantic cable,
but not nearby cities.
   The same storm today, though likely less damaging, could still
cause chaos. Major storms in New York in 1947 and Boston in 1978
caused serious dislocations, for example, Ludlum said.
   But they weren't the same.
   ``There has been more snow, but never the combination of low
temperatures, high winds and blowing snow. We've never had drifts
quite like '88,'' Ludlum said.

<HEAD>Bridge From Bloody Sunday To Super Tuesday A Victory March For
Jackson</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENDAL WEAVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SELMA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Jesse Jackson and his Deep South campaign
army, Super Tuesday may well be a victory march that began on a
bridge on Bloody Sunday.
   Black marchers seeking the right to vote were routed by Alabama
troopers on the bridge at Selma on what became known as Bloody
Sunday, March 7, 1965. As that anniversary approaches, black voters
are now forming ranks across Dixie to make Super Tuesday, March 8,
1988, a landmark march to the ballot box.
   Political and campaign officials say Jackson, the black
candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, could win six
states _ Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, Virginia and
North Carolina _ with some whites joining his core of black support.
   They say he possibly could run first in Arkansas, may be in the
top two in Maryland, and likely will run among the leaders
qualifying for rich numbers of delegates in the South's big bookend
states of Texas and Florida.
   ``February is black history month,'' says Rose Sanders, a black
who brought her Harvard Law School degree back to handle civil
rights work in Selma. ``We're telling young people to make super
black history on Super Tuesday.''
   Eleven Southern states with double-digit black voting
percentages are among 20 that hold primaries or caucuses March 8. A
12th, South Carolina, Jackson's home state, holds Democratic
caucuses four days after Super Tuesday. More than 900 Democratic
National Convention delegates are at stake among this Dixie dozen,
with Jackson in position to claim perhaps a third or more.
   That would delight his followers and also disturb his critics
who see him as an unelectable candidate threatening to fracture his
party. It will take 2,081 delegates to win the nomination at the
convention in Atlanta, far more than any campaign operatives or
political observers see Jackson cornering.
   Rivals such as Sen. Albert Gore Jr., who is expected to win
overwhelmingly in his native Tennessee, are angling for their share
of the Southern delegates. Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and
Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt _ whose home states are also in the
Super Tuesday lineup _ are counting on scores of delegates from
Super Tuesday states such as Texas as well as those inside and
outside the South.
   But while the final mix may be confusing, Sonia Jarvis,
executive director of the National Coalition on Black Voter
Participation in Washington, said Super Tuesday likely will be a
showcase for Jackson, particularly if he continues to draw white
voters to his cause.
   ``I think he will be very hard to beat in at least half the
primaries,'' she said.
   ``Jackson is in a very enviable position,'' said Wallace Hyde of
Raleigh, a Gore strategist, discussing North Carolina. ``You'd have
to say he is the favorite. His vote, I'd say, is motivated. It's
sort of a crusade to his people.''
   ``He's got three strong, white candidates running against him,''
said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political analyst,
reviewing that state's outlook. ``If all three of them stay in
contention for the three weeks of the campaign, then Jesse Jackson
is bound to do well. I think he's got a good chance to be the
plurality winner, but not the majority winner.''
   Jarvis said that in Jackson's first run for the presidency in
1984 his vote generally matched up with the percentage of black
voters. ``It wasn't always true, but that was the pattern,'' she
said.
   Now in such states as Iowa, New Hampshire and Minnesota, states
with small black voter percentages, Jackson has added white votes
in numbers that have elated his campaign.
   ``He is not just the blacks' candidate,'' said Sanders. ``He's
the people's candidate. Finally there are some whites in this
country beginning to recognize this.''
   Martin Moe, a white who graduated last year from Oberlin College
in Ohio, came out of Jackson's national campaign office in Chicago
to work for the candidate in Iowa and more recently help organize
in Alabama, where Jackson has targeted disenchanted whites,
including the poor, laid-off labor and beleaguered farm voters, as
well as blacks.
   ``Jackson is significantly broadening the base of his support,''
said Moe.
   But some blacks felt wounded by 1984, when a number of black
leaders sided with Walter Mondale and party rules rankled the
Jackson campaign.
   ``This time there is more of a wait-and-see approach among black
voters as opposed to the fervor of the first time around,'' said
Jarvis. Black voters, she said, seem to be saying, ``Let's see what
they do with Jackson this time around ... then we'll see how active
we'll be.''
   State Rep. Charles Young of Meridian, vice chairperson of the
black caucus in Mississippi, said he senses no apprehension that
the Democratic Party won't play fair with Jackson. For most blacks,
he said, the feeling is ``let's deal with the situation as it
comes.''
   The question looming now for the Jackson campaign is not whether
he will make history on Super Tuesday but what happens once that
bridge is crossed, especially if he should arrive in Atlanta with
none of his rivals having locked up the nomination.
   ``Whatever the results,'' said Robert James Jr., a north Alabama
Jackson campaign official, ``this country will never be the same
again poliltically.''

<HEAD>Super Tuesday a Super Puzzle to Networks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The television networks like to head into the
presidential primary season armed with polls and research and a
pretty good notion of what's going to happen and, therefore, how to
cover it.
   But the networks seem bewildered by the challenge of the March 8
``Super Tuesday'' primaries and caucuses, with multiple candidates
in both parties seeking delegates in 20 states from one end of the
country to the other, not to mention American Samoa.
   ``I think we're just now realizing the degree of difficulty,''
said NBC correspondent Dennis Murphy, who was on the campaign trail
in Atlanta last week.
   ``I've got Gephardt in South Dakota today. Jesse is in, I think,
the Carolinas,'' he said. ``You've got Dukakis at the statehouse.
Gephardt is on his way to Texas from South Dakota. We've got crews
strung out with these guys all over the map.
   ``I think it's as hard for them as it is for us,'' Murphy said.
``They can't put charters together to carry us in any convenient
fashion, so we've been chasing Gephardt around South Dakota in a
Lear jet. It's like $10,000-a-day coverage. So it's difficult to
bring all the stuff into one place and stay on top of coverage.''
   Two weeks before Super Tuesday, CBS and NBC decided the results
were likely to be so muddled that they had erred in expecting to
spend all of prime time _ in CBS' case, and two hours of it, in
NBC's _ on the results. Both cut their prime-time coverage by an
hour. ABC was still planning two hours.
   There is also a new austerity at the scaled-down network news
divisions that rules out coverage of every candidate every day _
the modus operandi in previous presidential years.
   ``It's a killer, there's no question,'' said CBS senior
political producer Richard Cohen. ``It's just as much a killer for
the candidates as it is for us, because there's so much ground to
cover ... We can't be 100 percent sure we're going to be everywhere
we want to be and not miss anything.''
   ``There's a lot of head scratching,'' said ABC correspondent
Jeff Greenfield. ``I always delight in that, because I think the
more that the people break out of the pattern that the press
presumes to impose, the healthier it is politically. I like the
fact that we have to wait for people to vote before we can rush in
and say, `Ah ha!'''
   The networks plan to treat the night of Super Tuesday itself
like a mini-general election. CBS and NBC will have anchors in New
York for prime-time specials.
   ``It is really much more like a national election than a
primary,'' said Greenfield. ``What makes it interesting is it's a
national election not with two candidates but with seven or eight.
So it's going to pose a heck of a challenge to begin to make these
distinctions clear to the viewers and readers.''
   CNN will base its anchors in Atlanta, its headquarters, and
spend most of prime time on the results.
   On PBS, ``The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' will close up relatively
early on Tuesday night, then get spend Wednesday night assessing
the results.
   Laughed associate editor Jim Lehrer, ``I can wait until the
results come and then say, `Hmmm, isn't that interesting.' I feel
sorry for some of my colleagues. They have to act like they know
what the hell's going on. I think it's just an act, because it is
so new and there are so many different factors.''
   The networks say this year's election is providing an
opportunity to reassess the way they cover politics, such as doing
more big-picture stories than the usual accounting of the day's
events on the campaign trail.
   NBC's Murphy, for instance, assigned to the Democrats, eschewed
tailing Gephardt in favor of a broader story examining the trade
issue.
   ``It may look a little less here-they-come-there-they-go
campaign-like from the kind of stuff that we filed in the past,
which would be just fine with me,'' Murphy said. ``How much can you
say about the guy at a staged photo event, any one of these
people?''
   The 1988 elections could change not only the way campaigns are
covered, but how campaigns are run. For years, the news media have,
in effect, subsidized the candidates' chartered airplanes by paying
1{ times the cost of a first-class ticket to ride from campaign
stop to stop.
   Campaigns counted on the networks sending a reporter and camera
crew around after the candidate. This year, however, with too many
candidates and too little money, networks are going to so-called
``zone coverage'' as opposed to ``man-to-man'' coverage, having
correspondents like Murphy cover multiple candidates and larger
issues and relying on local affiliates for standard campaign-stop
coverage.

<TEXT>
   Angela Sanbrano was a student in law school
and working on immigration cases in a legal clinic in 1980. She
kept running into women from El Salvador who said they had been
tortured. ``I wondered how we could try and stop this,'' she says.
   Leslie Schuld was a student at the Univesity of Dayton in Ohio
in 1981 when she saw a film on the violence in El Salvador. She
says she started reading the troubled history of that troubled
country.
   Jon Haines was working as an aide in a nursing home in Seattle.
``In 1981, it looked like the United States would be getting more
invlved in El Salvador, and I was really concerned about that,'' he
says.
   These people were drawn to an organization which was just coming
into being at the time _ CISPES, the Committee in Solidarity with
the People of El Salvador.
   So was the FBI _ twice. In a case which recalls the excesses of
the communist-hunting days of the 1950s that led to restrictions on
FBI investigations into political activity, the bureau has come
under criticism for the way it infiltrated CISPES and employed an
informer for more than three years who, the FBI now says, supplied
``disinformation and misinformation.''
   The first time the FBI investigated CISPES it suspected it was
operating as a foreign front. The second time, it suspected CISPES
was engaging in terrorism and had ``cells'' of members planning to
commit violence and sabotage.
   But the upshot was embarrassment, and a new round of qustions
about the bureau's squeaky clean image under former Director
William Webster, now the head of the CIA.
   The Senate Intelligence Committee already has conducted one
hearing into the FBI's conduct and the House panel that oversees
the FBI plans to hold hearings as well.
   At issue is whether the FBI went too far in conducting domestic
surveillance of CISPES, violating the First Amendment rights of
group members to express their political opinions.
   Or as Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, a member of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, put it, ``The issues we're talking about go
to the very heart of the confidence the American people have in the
FBI.''
   Why did the FBI conduct two investigations of CISPES over a
five-year period if, in fact, the group was merely one of hundreds
in the United States that work to bring about change in American
foreign policy?
   The Associated Press interviewed members of CISPES and reviewed
the 2,000 pages of FBI documents, many partially or totally blacked
out by government censors. They were provided in response to a
Freedom of Information request to the Center for Constitutional
Rights in New York. The FBI gave its first detailed explanation of
its investigation in a report to the Senate Intelligence Committee
on Tuesday.
   The story begins in October 1980, with the founding of CISPES at
conferences in Los Angeles and Washington.
   The FBI claims that it obtained a document, reportedly seized
from the Communist guerillas in El Salvador, indicating that the
Communist Party in the United States was involved in the
establishment of CISPES.
   Specifically, the FBI says Farid Handal, the brother of the head
of the Salvadoran Communist Party, met with Sandra Pollock, a
member of the central committee of the Communist Party in the
United States, in March 1980 to work out a way of getting financial
and moral support for the Salvadoran guerrillas. CISPES was that
way, the FBI contends.
   Beth Perry, a spokeswoman for CISPES who attended the founding
conference in Los Angeles, acknowledged in a recent interview that
Handal did attend the meeting.
   ``People knew he was a member of the Communist Party,'' Perry
said. ``Handal put out his opinions in discussions. We listened
because we were interested in all Salvadorans' opinions. But
dominating, he wasn't.''
   Perry said Pollock attended the East Coast conference in
Washington, and ``just like Farid's, hers was just one voice. In
terms of this is the (Communist Party) line, absolutely not. In
terms of what we ought to do, absolutely not.''
   At the time, the violence in El Salvador was in the news almost
daily. One news story at the end of 1980 declared that the civil
war in the Central American nation had taken 8,500 lives that year.
   Less than two months after CISPES' founding, three Roman
Catholic nuns and a lay worker were killed and buried in a roadside
grave. The sisters were in El Salvador to aid refugees from rural
areas who were fleeing the violence between leftist and rightist
guerillas.
   ``When I was getting the testimony from these people for filing
their immigration papers, I learned of what these people had gone
through in El Salvador,'' said Sanbrano, the law student who was
working on immigration cases in 1980. ``Some of the women had been
involved in starting unions. They talked about how they had been
tortured, and it really touched me. I wondered how we could try and
stop this.''
   She joined CISPES as a volunteer and worked her way up to
Southwest regional coordinator in 1983 to national coordinator in
1985. She was re-elected to the top spot in 1987, with the new
title, executive director.
   She said the group has two main objectives _ ``to change U.S.
policy in El Salvador from a militaristic policy to a
political-diplomatic policy and to allow Central Americans to
determine their own destiny.''
   ``Being in solidarity with the people of El Salvador means we
support their struggle for peace and justice and work with them to
win that struggle,'' she said. ``Solidarity means to take someone
else's struggle and make it your own.''
   Sanbrano, who is of Mexican origin, said CISPES ``openly
supports'' the Communist guerillas, known as the Frente Farabundo
Marti de Liberacion Nacional, or FMLN. But she said the support is
not financial. ``We believe they are a legitimate political
organization in El Salvador.''
   The FBI, in its report on the CISPES investigation, says the
FMLN is responsible for numerous terrorist activities, including
the May 1983 assassination of Navy Lt. Cmdr. Albert A.
Schaufelberger, who was the U.S. military adviser in El Salvador.
   Perry, the spokeswoman for CISPES, agreed that the FMLN has
killed Americans. ``We don't want to see anyone killed, but there's
a civil war going on there. People get caught in a war.''
   She later added, ``We feel Americans should not be there. If the
United States got out of El Salvador, no Americans would be
killed.''

   No one in CISPES interviewed by the AP recalled any violent
actions ever being discussed at meetings. All said there no secret
``cells'' of members planning terrorist actions. And all generally
gave the same report of activities in their area by CISPES, ranging
from petition drives to demonstrations to inviting speakers to
their meetings. Two described their meetings as ``long and boring.''
   Sanbrano said CISPES also does a lot of fund-raising, much of it
going to running the group and producing newsletters and other
literature. She said she gets a salary of $865 a month, as do most
of the full-time workers for CISPES.
   Some of the money the group raises does go for humanitarian aid
and for agricultural projects in El Salvador, she said, ``but we
don't fund the FMLN.''
   Although the CISPES members interviewed had different reasons
for joining the group, all said they joined to bring about a change
in U.S. policy in Central America.
   Leslie Schuld, the University of Dayton student, now Midwest
regional director of CISPES, joined the group in 1981. She said the
film shown by a local chapter of CISPES on the violence in El
Salvador shocked her. She said she read up on the history of El
Salvador and on U.S. involvement in Central America and went to
work as a volunteer for CISPES.
   Jon Haines, the nursing home aide, joined at about the same
time. He said he was growing increasingly concerned about U.S.
involvement in El Salvador. ``In 1981, it looked like the United
States would be getting more involved in El Salvador, and I was
really concerned about that,'' he said.
   In Dallas, Parker Wilson was a legal counsel to Sears. ``I
remember having a general concern about the Central America
situation and our government's actions,'' he said. He joined the
local chapter of CISPES, which he described as ``a little, scraggly
group'' in the early 1980s. It held meetings in a Catholic church.
   Not long after the Dallas chapter was formed, the FBI hired a
former evangelist from El Salvador, Frank Varelli, to inform on the
group. Varelli began work on March 10, 1981, according to his
testimony last year to the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil
and constitutional rights.
   For more than three years, he testified to the House panel, he
told the FBI what it wanted to hear. He told the FBI that CISPES'
activities were being directed by the Salvadoran guerillas and that
members of CISPES were engaged in international terrorism or were
knowingly helping those engaged in terrorism.
   The FBI says it began its first investigation of CISPES on Sept.
3, 1981, at the Justice Department's request. In its report to the
Senate Intelligence Committee, the FBI says it was asked to
determine whether CISPES was supplying money and material to the
Communist guerillas in El Salvador and, therefore, should register
under the Foreign Agents Registration Act.
   Oliver B. Revell, FBI executive assistant director, told the
Intelligence panel, that the probe was ``just a records check,''
and it was closed on Feb. 23, 1982.
   The FBI opened its second investigation of CISPES on March 30,
1983, largely on the basis of Varelli's information, the FBI says
in its report to the Senate Intelligence Committee. This was a
counterterrorism investigation, which gives the FBI far more
sweeping powers than the first probe. It requires only that there
be probable cause to suspect a terrorist threat to justify domestic
surveillance.
   Varelli continued working as an informer for the FBI for more
than three years, telling it in 1984 that members of CISPES were
plotting to assassinate President Reagan and disrupt the Republican
National Convention in Dallas. He stopped working for the FBI in
August 1984 and in March 1986 filed suit to get the rest of the pay
he felt he was owed for his FBI work. The case is still pending.
   The FBI closed its investigation of CISPES on June 18, 1985,
because, Revell said, ``we found insufficient evidence to continue.
... Part of the reason for that was the disinformation and
misinformation supplied by Mr. Varelli.''
   Wilson, of the Dallas chapter, said he considers the FBI
infiltration of the group ``so peculiar. The organization has
always been open to anyone who wanted to come. There was no need
for infiltration.''

<HEAD>Super Tuesday Fields Crowded and Still Unclear</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUB 8th graf to CORRECT GOP delegates to 712 bgng ``At
stake...''</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   North Florida farmer Fred Williams has an analysis of the Super
Tuesday primaries across the South and elsewhere: ``There are too
many hogs in the creek and the water is muddy.''
   Little more than a week from the regionwide presidential
primaries in both parties, his farm analogy remains apt. The
picture in both parties hasn't entirely cleared, and the races
remain crowded.
   Super Tuesday, the closest the nation has ever come to a
national primary, could crystallize the nomination races,
particularly on the Republican side. But there's as much likelihood
it won't.
   Pat Robertson is a wild card that threatens to confuse the
Republican race. He has the opportunity to do well, maybe even win,
in some small-turnout primaries in areas where he built devoted
followings through years as a television evangelist.
   And if no Democrat strongly emerges, that race may not come
close to being decided on March 8 and the field will move on to the
next round of Northern industrial states, still crowded with three
or four candidates.
   ``Super Tuesday is not fulfilling the wishes of its founders,''
said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.
   Twenty states hold Democratic primaries or caucuses on Tuesday,
March 8, and they stretch from Massachusetts to Florida to Idaho;
there are 17 GOP contests. The day is mainly Southern, with 14
contests in Southern or border states. Democrats also hold a caucus
in American Samoa.
   At stake are 1,307 Democratic and 712 Republican delegates _
about one-third the total in both parties.
   Southern legislators set the whole thing up with the aim of
providing a conservative or moderating influence on the Democratic
nomination process, countering and perhaps stealing the thunder of
earlier contests. The GOP went along, often because Democrats
control the legislatures in those Southern states.
   The primary may yet move the Democratic nominee to the right.
But it didn't diminish the early contests. Wins in Iowa and New
Hampshire have helped propel Richard Gephardt and Michael Dukakis
in polls of the South.
   And so far no single Democrat has emerged with broad appeal
across the South _ the region Democrats agree they must carry to
regain the White House.
   Among the Republicans, the South looks like George Bush
territory. President Reagan has always been popular there and the
vice president has successfully _ so far at least _ managed to
appear the heir. Polls show him leading Dole two-to-one or better
in the region.
   He has the added benefit of a Southern organization regarded as
unsurpassed. But all those strengths looked as thin as the paper
they were written on when Bush appeared on the verge of losing New
Hampshire to Sen. Bob Dole.
   Bush won, of course, but Dole, Robertson and New York Rep. Jack
Kemp hope to attack Bush's base and prove it broad but thin.
   Kemp needs to do well somewhere in the South to be able to
sustain his campaign and the argument that he is the conservative
alternative.
   Robertson, who became known across the South and elsewhere as
host of the ``700 Club'' program on his own religious cable
network, has drawn a line in the dirt of South Carolina. He needs
to win somewhere, and he says that's where it will be.
   South Carolina isn't a Super Tuesday state; its GOP caucuses are
three days earlier. But it is being watched.
   Bush has organizational and institutional strength there. But
Robertson contends the state is fertile ground for him too. Its GOP
primary usually has a low voter turnout, and crossover Democratic
voting is allowed _ a made-to-order formula for Robertson's
strength based in fundamentalist churches.
   Dole is contesting the state, too, but could finish third. Dole
must pick his shots and concentrate in areas where he can profit
under the GOP's winner-take-all rules in many congressional
districts and states.
   Should Robertson produce victories in the South, the GOP race
could prove a prolonged and bitter fight with Bush, Dole and
Robertson. But Robertson must still demonstrate he has appeal
beyond his evangelical base and can be more than a disruptive force
for the GOP.
   Jesse Jackson leads in the polls in many Southern states and is
certain to do well in states with heavy black voting populations.
He wants to do well in the South but will go on to the convention
in Atlanta this summer regardless.
   ``He's going to have enough votes to play somebody's fiddle,''
said Williams, the Grand Ridge, Fla., farmer who backs Jackson.
``They'll trade for votes just like we trade pigs and cows.''
   Dukakis has run well in some Southern polls and has a good
organization in many states. As governor of Massachusetts, he
carries the image of a liberal state that triggers opposition in
many Southern quarters.
   ``There is just an innate fear of somebody from Massachusetts,''
said Louisiana Democratic chairman James Brady. ``They're
associated with Tip O'Neill and Teddy Kennedy.''
   But Dukakis hopes to win Florida, where he has strong support in
the southern end of the state, and perhaps Texas too. With
Massachusetts voting that day as well he could be the big delegate
winner.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee has tried to position himself
to the right of the Democratic field, depicting the rest as liberal
``peas in a pod.'' He must do well across the region, and polls
have shown him running as high as second and as low as fourth in
the region.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, winner in Iowa and South Dakota, is also
attracting conservative and moderate Democratic voters in some
states with his well-honed appeal to concerns about foreign
competition and a message that America is in economic decline.
   He has shown strength among blue-collar voters, and so far has
concentrated his effort in the economically hard-hit
energy-producing states of the South, where his call for an
oil-import fee is a further boost. A Texas poll had him leading
that huge delegate state but falling back after Dukakis won New
Hampshire.
   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois has no visible Southern strength.
Gary Hart appears to be fading.
   With so broad a field and so many contests, how will we know who
wins Super Tuesday?
   Florida and Texas are the big prizes, and if a candidate carries
both of those, it will be hard for anyone else to argue they won
Super Tuesday, although some no doubt will.
   As the nomination race moves on, delegates are what matters.
Massachusetts has the next biggest Democratic total, and Dukakis
figures to get most of them. Jackson, too, will get a big share of
Southern delegates.
   Still another measure will be the cross-over voting. It is
allowed in eight of Southern and border Super Tuesday states _
Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas
and Virginia.
   A big Republican primary vote in those states, at the cost of
Democratic votes, could be a harbinger for the fall.

<HEAD>A Postcard From Plains, Where Super Tuesday Isn't Uppermost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULES LOH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PLAINS, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the hometown of the 39th president, where
politics was once the driving energy, The Kountry Korner is the
place to go for coffee, catfish and gossip.
   Eavesdrop there and you will hear table talk about Mildred
Wise's hand crocheted bedspread, the before-and-after beauty
treatment pictures of Cathy Williams on page 124 in the current
``Good Housekeeping,'' Mayor Ralph McDonald's recent illness, the
prospects for bass and bream, and unvarnished views on errant TV
evangelists.
   But if hot insight into the Super Tuesday primaries is the
object of your eavsdropping, you eavesdrop in vain.
   ``I don't know why people aren't talking about Super Tuesday,''
Marlene Dozier, the Kountry Korner's chief cook and part owner, was
saying the other day.``I suppose they aren't much interested.
   ``When is it?''
   At least one Plains citizen with that famous name knows when it
is. In fact, Hugh Carter, the former president's cousin, has
already voted.
   ``I'm going to be away March 8 so I went ahead and marked my
absentee ballot,'' Hugh Carter said, bending over a stack of books
with a felt tip pen.
   And?
   ``Gore. I voted for Albert Gore.''
   Hugh Carter, too, has not observed any stirring interest among
his townspeople in the primary. None of the Democrats seeking the
presidential nomination has seen fit to make Plains a campaign
stop. And Jimmy Carter, who still maintains a home here, has
studiously refrained from saying which of the Democrats he
personally favors for the presidential nomination.
   Nonetheless, Hugh Carter believes the turnout of Plains' 265
eligible voters will be strong.
   ``We have to vote at the same time on a county tax increase.
That'll get 'em out.''
   Hugh Carter, seven-term state senator, author, ``antiques''
dealer and worm raiser, is the town's leading purveyor of Jimmy
Carter souvenirs.
   You can pick up a Plains souvenir from the Kountry Korner
cashier, or at the drug store or the Peanut Gallery, which also
sells gas, but Hugh Carter's emporium, for pure variety of ball
points, salt shakers, paperweights and postcards, outdoes anything
at the Grand Canyon or Niagara Falls.
   ``People come to Plains they want something to take home, show
they've been here,'' he said.
   The one item he hopes all visitors will take home is a copy of
his book about the Carter family, ``Cousin Beedie and Cousin Hot.''
A huge sign out front promises that every copy will be autographed.
He also sells, it appears, every scrap of writing ever written by
every Carter who ever lived.
   But business is a far cry from what it once was.
   Before Jimmy Carter was elected president, his brother, Billy,
described Plains, a town of 687 then as now, as a place where a
hound dog could lie down in the middle of Main Street on Saturday
night and sleep unharmed at least until Monday morning.
   Then, during the early presidential years, visitors came in
droves, hordes, sometimes 20,000 or more a day, so many, Hugh
Carter recalls, that they had to hire nine policemen just to direct
traffic.
   Now Plains is back to three cops, one on duty at a time, and
except for an occasional tour bus that hound dog would be safe all
week.
   The old depot, which served as Carter's 1976 campaign
headquarters, was recently designated a National Historic Site
along with Carter's boyhood home and high school. All are models of
life in the rural South in another era.
   ``We're hoping, of course, that the Historic Site designation
will bring more tourists,'' says Annie Mae Vaughn, a volunteer,
putting down her book when a visitor entered the depot. The Vaughns
and Carters have been neighbors for three generations.
   Nothing remotely connected with Carter is overlooked as a
possible tourist attraction. A self-guided tour booklet lists 25
places of interest: Jimmy's church, his former church, the post
office where he mails his letters, his mother's home, his brother's
home, his grandmother's home, his wife's brother's home, the home
where his parents had an apartment when they first married.

   ``No,'' said Hugh Carter. ``Jimmy was born in a hospital. But

   United Mine Workers President Richard Trumka says
he considers the union's failed merger with the Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Workers union ``a closed deal'' that won't be reconsidered.
   OCAW's executive board on Tuesday voted 6-2 to reject a merger
that would have created the United Mine, Energy and Chemical
Workers of America from the two powerful unions.
   Trumka said Wednesday the OCAW board had left open the
possibility of reconsidering the merger, but the UMW's board voted
Wednesday to rescind the approval it gave on Sunday.

   A federal judge has given the Environmental
Protection Agency until April 15 to ban the sale and commercial use
of products containing an anti-termite pesticide believed to cause
cancer.
   U.S. District Judge Louis Oberdorfer ruled Wednesday that the
EPA had acted illegally by allowing 197 holders of federal
pesticide licenses to sell existing stocks of products containing
the pesticides chlordane and heptachlor.
   Oberdorfer said EPA failed to take into account whether
continued sale or use of the products ``would pose any unreasonable
risk to man or the environment.''

   A new test that identifies AIDS virus antibodies
in blood is dramatically reducing the incidence of inconclusive
tests for evidence of the deadly disease, its maker says.
   Inconclusive results of AIDS tests can be terrifying for
patients because they raise the possibility of infection,
SmithKline Bio-Science Laboratories said Wednesday in announcing
immediate availability of the new test.
   Known as Hivagen, the new test also virtually eliminates false
positive readings, which are already uncommon under current testing
procedures for acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the
Philadelphia-based company said.
   ``This test is a quantum leap forward in AIDS testing,'' John
Mills, chief of infectious diseases at San Francisco General
Hospital, said in a statement released by SmithKline.
   Mills performed clinical trials on the value of Hivagen as a
replacement for the Western blot assay, the current standard test
for blood samples that flunk mass screenings.
   SmithKline said it would perform the tests at its own lab for
$80 apiece, about the same price as the Western blot assay.
   False positive readings, even though they represent a small
fraction of tests, have become more common because AIDS antibody
testing itself has become more common.
   About 29 million people will be screened for AIDS antibodies
this year, and about 500,000 will be referred for further tests,
SmithKline officials estimated. The company said false positive
readings might range as high as 5 percent on certain inferior
versions of the Western blot assay, commonly used for further
testing.
   In response, Du Pont Co. said its own widely used version of the
Western blot assay produces virtually no false positives because
the company has an extremely strict standard for what constitutes a
positive reading.
   SmithKline officials conceded the Du Pont test, the only one
licensed by the Food and Drug Administration for blood donor
screening, produces few if any false positives.
   With the Hivagen test, false positive readings simply cannot
occur, company officials asserted. But some scientists were
cautious.
   ``It may well be that this represents a substantial advance, but
you wonder whether it can really be perfect,'' said Dr. Klemens
Meyer, an internist and decision analyst at New England Medical
Center in Boston, who said he had no first-hand knowledge of
Hivagen.
   The presence of AIDS antibodies does not necessarily mean a
person has the disease. The most recent studies have shown that 30
percent to 40 percent of people with AIDS antibodies have later
developed the disease, although many doctors believe that
percentage will rise eventually.
   SmithKline has applied for patents on the synthetic molecules
used in the Hivagen test, said Martin Rosenberg, vice president of
biopharmaceutical research and development.
   In tests of more than 2,500 blood samples at San Francisco
General Hospital, Hivagen was inconclusive in 2.5 percent to 4.2
percent of the patients, vs. 15.6 percent to 18 percent
inconclusive results for the Western blot assay, said Dr. John
Mills, the hospital's chief of infectious diseases.
   In another test of the blood of volunteers, the Hivagen test was
accurate for all 225 people who did not have the AIDS antibody and
was accurate in 135 of the 136 patients without symptoms who did
have the AIDS antibody. In the lone exception, the test was
inconclusive, Mills said.
   Other companies also have introduced or are working on better
tests for AIDS, including Cetus Corp. of Emeryville, Calif., which
is developing a test for AIDS virus genes, and Cambridge BioScience
Corp. of Worcester, Mass., which has applied for regulatory
approval for an antibody test.
   The Hivagen test does not require FDA approval because the
technology is not for sale to others, Groome said. However, FDA
officials are aware of the test and have invited a SmithKline
scientist to speak on the subject at a conference next week in
Washington, he said.

   When plans for a national energy union fizzled,
United Mine Workers President Richard Trumka said he started
looking for other ways to expand his union's influence.
   ``We're going to pursue a policy of growth for our
organization,'' Trumka said Wednesday after the Oil Chemical and
Atomic Workers International Union and the UMW rejected a merger
agreement that would have created the United Mine, Energy and
Chemical Workers of America.
   ``I spent four or five hours last night with pencil and paper
trying to work out ways to expand our union,'' Trumka said.
   Trumka said he considers the failed merger ``a closed deal''
that won't be reconsidered, although OCAW spokesman Rod Rogers said
his union doesn't necessarily agree.
   ``It's always possible there could bea resurrection of the
idea,'' he said.
   ``There were compelling reasons why this merger was a good idea,
and those reasons haven't gone away,'' Rogers said. ``This
particular merger proposal is dead, yes, but we could take action
to re-initiate things.''
   Trumka said he was ready to look elsewhere to expand, however.
   ``I'll come back at the next (UMW) board meeting and say, `That
didn't work; let's try something else,''' Trumka said.
   The proposal for a merger between the two energy unions, which
each claim about 100,000 active members, was rejected Tuesday by
OCAW's executive board on a 6-2 vote, largely because it wanted
assurances there would be no dues increase, Trumka said. The UMW
then rescinded the approval it gave Sunday.
   Trumka said both unions would continue to work together,
especially on negotiations with common employers.
   While he plans to look for other ways to expand the UMW's
influence, Trumka said, he said he did not consider it good policy
``to merge just for the sake of merging.''

<TEXT>
   Automaking giant General Motors Corp., which a
year ago was wallowing in lotfuls of unsold cars, is showing signs
of resurgence because of higher demand for profitable models and an
aggressive sales-incentive campaign.
   The biggest U.S. automaker announced Wednesday that it will add
about 130,000 cars and 45,000 trucks to previously trimmed 1988
production plans and recall 8,600 employees at four factories.
   The expansion will be made via restoration of second shifts at
three plants, reopening of a closed plant in Framingham, Mass., and
running some plants on overtime.
   ``The strengthening demand for GM vehicles reflects the ongoing
product quality improvements resulting from plant modernization and
employee involvement programs,'' GM President Robert Stempel said
in a statement.
   ``This combined with very competitive retail incentive programs
has increased the value of GM products,'' he said.
   At the three plants where GM had dropped the second shift,
workers from both shifts were sharing jobs by alternating between
two weeks on layoff and two weeks on the job, GM said.
   The Framingham assembly plant, which GM closed abruptly Nov. 30,
will reopen May 9 on one shift with 2,000 of its 3,700 workers. The
plant will build the Oldsmobile Cutlass Cierra, but will not resume
production of the Chevrolet Celebrity, GM spokeswoman Kathy Tanner
said.
   GM will restore the second shift at its
Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac Group assembly plant in Lansing, Mich.,
April 11, returning 2,000 people to full-time work. The
4,350-worker plant builds the Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais and Buick
Skylark.
   The second shift at GM's 4,200-worker Van Nuys, Calif., assembly
plant will be restored March 14, bringing 1,900 employees back full
time. The plant, which is GM's only Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac
Firebird source, dropped the second shift last week.
   GM also will restore the second shift at its Oshawa No. 1 plant
in Oshawa, Ontario, bringing back 2,700 laid-off workers on March
21. The plant builds the Oldsmobile Cierra and Pontiac 6000.
   The company said it would increase production at the Cadillac
plant in the Detroit enclave of Hamtramck by running its single
shift on overtime, adding 4,700 cars between Feb. 20 and June 1.
   Cadillac General Manager John Grettenberger said the increased
production was necessary because dealers need more of the restyled
Eldorado coupe and Seville sedans, enjoying high popularity due to
a new engine model.
   GM's expansion plans contrast sharply to the same time about a
year ago, when it suffered slumping sales, a three-month backlog of
vehicles and loss of market share to its main U.S. rivals, Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
   Uncertainty over GM's prospects was heightened after the October
stock market crash, which raised fears that consumers would buy
fewer cars. All domestic automakers trimmed production plans
afterward, but pessimism has since been eased by healthy sales.
   In January, Ford Motor Co., the nation's No. 2 automaker, added
75,000 cars to its plans for the first half of 1987, including
53,000 cars in the second quarter, said Ford spokesman Raymond
Windecker.
   Chrysler Corp., the No. 3 automaker, announced plans last week
to add 20,000 cars to its second-quarter schedule.
   Chris Cedergren, an industry analyst with the firm J.D. Power
and Associates, said the change in GM's plans reflect ``a little
bit of resurgence'' of sales.
   He noted that the added cars are high-profit models, an
indication that GM's profitability may improve in 1988 after two
years of higher earnings by Ford.
   The changes do not affect GM's Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac Group
assembly plant in Kansas City, Mo., still scheduled to shut down
indefinitely on April 15, idling 1,600 workers, GM spokesman Tom
Pyden said.

<HEAD>Independent Researcher Questions Effectiveness of New Female
Condom</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new ``condom for females,'' pioneered in
Europe, was hailed by developers as revolutionary, but an
independent researcher questioned the device's effectiveness.
   The disposable contraceptive, made of polyurethane, resembles a
condom but is worn by women, researchers said Wednesday as they
publicly unveiled the device.
   The developers said the female condom would be effective at
preventing pregnancy and predicted it would become a major weapon
in the fight against the spread of AIDS and other sexually
transmitted diseases.
   ``It takes the advantages of both the male condom and the female
diaphragm and gets rid of significant disadvantages,'' said Mary
Ann Leeper, head of the research team developing the device for
Wisconsin Pharmacal Co., which will market it in the United States
and Canada.
   But Dr. Gerald Zatuchni, a gynecologist with 25 years experience
in researching and developing new contraceptives, said he saw the
potential for ``real problems'' with the device.
   ``I have not seen the device nor have there been any published
studies that would indicate its acceptability to couples, the
effectiveness of the device in preventing pregnancy or any
side-effects from using the device,'' Zatuchni said.
   The device, known in Europe as a ``fem-shield'' or vaginal
shield, isn't sold anywhere yet, but testing has begun in Europe
and is to start in the United States in March, officials said.
   The developers said they wouldn't have statistics on how
effective the device is in preventing pregnancy or the spread of
diseases like acquired immune deficiency syndrome until additional
studies are completed.
   The contraceptive consists of a soft, loose-fitting polyurethane
sheath and two diaphragm-like, flexible polyurethane rings, Ms.
Leeper said.
   One ring lies inside the sheath and serves as an insertion
mechanism and internal anchor, fitting against the woman's cervix
much like a diaphragm, she said. The other ring forms the outer
edge of the sheath and remains outside the vagina.
   ``It is no more difficult to insert than a tampon,'' said Dr.
Paul Salmon, who helped organize tests of the device at London's
Middlesex Hospital.
   The company, based in Jackson, Wis., said the device would
provide more protection than the male condom, in part because the
material is stronger and covers a larger physical area, reducing
chances of infection or exposure to body fluids.
   It also would be more convenient to use than a diaphragm, Ms.
Leeper said, because it doesn't have to be initially fitted by a
doctor and can be inserted ``six hours before the sex act or six
minutes before.''
   But Zatuchni, a gynecology and obstetrics professor at
Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago, said the idea of
a ``one-size-fits-all'' condom for females ``would be sort of
ridiculous because women's anatomy varies so much.''
   ``It would be hard to envision such a device staying on during
the act of intercourse,'' Zatuchni said.
   Ms. Leeper said proper fitting would take place during
intercourse.
   She said the company had no estimate on how much the device
would cost consumers.
   The ``female condom'' was developed by an international group of
gynecologists and obstetricians, headed by Danish gynecologist Dr.
Erik Gregersen and his wife, Bente.
   The device has been tested on 80 couples in the United Kingdom,
Denmark and Sweden, and additional clinical trials are continuing
in Europe, Ms. Leeper said.
   The World Health Organization also plans to conduct clinical
trials in 15 countries, including Brazil, Thailand, Singapore and
nations battling the spread of AIDS in central Africa.
   AIDS, a deadly disease with no known cure, is believed to be
spread mainly through sexual intercourse, shared hypodermic needles
and from infected mothers to their infants at or before birth.
   In the United States, a first round of 500 clinical tests of the
new contraceptive is to begin in March, followed by a second phase
of 1,000 tests in May, Ms. Leeper said.
   The company hopes to apply to the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration this summer for permission to begin marketing the
device commercially in the United States by the end of the year.

<HEAD>Civil Lawsuit Against Hunt Brothers Opens in Manhattan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The lawyer for a South American mineral concern
suing the Hunt brothers of Dallas opened his case Wednesday by
spinning a tale of financial intrigue involving Texas oilmen and
Arab sheiks.
   Minpeco S.A., a mineral marketing company owned by the Peruvian
government, is suing the three Hunt brothers, claiming they
conspired to corner the world silver market in 1979 and 1980.
   Named as defendants in the case that opened before U.S. District
Judge Morris E. Lasker were: Nelson Bunker Hunt, William Herbert
Hunt and Lamar Hunt.
   ``We will show that they did this using their incredible
fortunes with utter contempt for the legal and economic system that
was so good to them,'' Mark Cymrot, attorney for Minpeco, told the
jury in his opening statement at federal court in Manhattan.
   None of the Hunts were present in court and they were not
expected to appear until the defense begins its case.
   Other defendants include Mahmoud Fustok, described as the owner
of one of the world's largest thoroughbred stables and
brother-in-law of a Saudi Arabian prince.
   ``We will show that they were greedy, power-hungry and
unscrupulous,'' said Cymrot, adding ``What we intend to show is
that these men rigged the silver market.''
   He claimed that the Hunts and their alleged co-conspirators were
responsible for the sharp rise in silver prices from about $9 an
ounce to more than $50 an ounce between September 1979 and January
1980.
   Minpeco claims the skyrocketing prices caused it to lose more
than $100 million when the world silver market collapsed in March
1980, with prices falling back to about $10 an ounce.
   Six financial institutions accused of participating in the
alleged conspiracy have settled with Minpeco for a total of $64.6
million.
   Minpeco is seeking about $150 million in damages plus treble
damages under both the anti-trust and racketeering laws which it
claims the Hunts and thier co-conspirators violated.
   But in his opening argument to the jury, the Hunts's lawyer
belittled those claims.
   The defense lawyer, Paul Curran, said rising interest rates,
inflation and crude oil prices, coupled with an unstable world
political situation, led to the silver market price rise.
   He ticked off the Iranian revolution, the seizure of American
hostages at the U.S. embassy in Teheran and the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan.
   ``It was these world and economic events that were the reason
for the sharp rise in silver prices,'' said Curran.
   He conceded silver prices went up, but noted gold, platinum and
diamond prices also rose during the same period because ``the price
of silver has historically fluctuated as a result of events in the
market place and in the world.''
   The trial is expected to last several months.

   Signs warning of potentially harmful
chemicals in everything from foods to workplaces will sprout across
California this weekend under a law approved by voters in 1986.
   ``WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the State
of California to cause cancer.'' This sign could be seen on store
shelves.
   ``WARNING: Chemicals known to the State of California to cause
cancer, or birth defects or other reproductive harm may be present
in foods or beverages sold or served here.'' This sign could be
printed on restaurant menus.
   ``WARNING: This area contains a chemical known to the State of
California to cause cancer.'' This sign could be posted on a
service station island, along a factory fence or on an assembly
line.
   In addition, there will be labels, newsaper advertisements,
letters and telephone hot lines telling people about chemicals in
the products they buy and the environment in which they work and
live.
   But there probably won't be any warning signs for the more than
15,000 grocery, drug and cosmetic products bought every day.
Temporary state regulations say that such products manufactured
under existing state and federal rules don't have to contain
warnings.
   The signs will be the first visible result of the anti-toxics
initiative approved by voters following a bitter struggle between
environmentalists who wrote the measure, including the Sierra Club
and the Environmental Defense Fund, and business interests.
   Proposition 65 will also mean confusion, with businesses
responding differently to its warning requirements. And dozens of
lawsuits could occupy the courts for years as supporters and
opponents continue to quarrel over its intent and requirements.
   ``The period ahead will be filled with charges and
countercharges, pressures and counterpressures and intense
courtroom litigation,'' says Assemblyman Tom Hayden, one of the
initiative's major backers and the leader of a star-studded
Hollywood group that campaigned hard for the measure.
   ``There are probably still people who wish the proposition had
never happened ... but there are people who have come to grips with
it as an expression of people's concern,'' said Thomas Warriner of
the state Health and Welfare Agency, who wrote the regulations.
   The initiative requires anyone who causes people to be exposed
to any of 29 chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or birth
defects to issue an advance warning.
   Those chemicals include five that business officials say are
present in varying levels throughout society: asbestos, benzene,
lead, chromium and arsenic.
   For example, benzene is in gasoline and most service stations
will probably have to post warning signs on their fuel islands.
Chromium is in stainless steel, magnetic tapes, paint pigments and
cement.
   Also, citizens who feel they've been exposed to a cancer- or
birth defect-causing chemical can take action if authorities won't
and collect 25 percent of any eventual fine.
   Republican Gov. George Deukmejian, who opposed the initiative,
followed issued the list of 29 chemicals ``known to the state to
cause cancer or reproductive toxicity'' and has appointed a
12-member panel to study whether more than 200 other chemicals
should be added to the list.
   Backers of the plan sued Deukmejian, saying the initiative
required about 250 chemicals to be on the first list. A Superior
Court judge agreed, but the Deukmejian's appeal is pending.
   The advisory panel has in the past year added almost all the
200-plus chemicals to the list. But adding them later, rather than
on Feb. 27, means they are subject to the initiative's other
requirements at later dates.
   The initiative requires any business with 10 or more employes to
give a ``clear and reasonable warning'' before exposing anyone to
any of the chemicals on the list, beginning one year after their
making the list.
   Another part of the initiative doesn't take effect until Oct. 27
for the first 27 chemicals. That part prohibits businesses from
discharging any of the listed chemicals into drinking water
sources, beginning 20 months after a chemical's inclusion on the
list.

<HEAD>Santa Fe Rejects Henley's Takeover Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Henley Group Inc., rebuffed in its latest attempt
to take control of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., has accepted
the rejection quietly.
   ``We are disappointed but not surprised,'' said Henley spokesman
Norm Ritter.
   Santa Fe Southern on Wednesday turned down Henley's bid to buy
44.6 million new shares for $780 million. The offer, made on
Monday, was conditioned up the company abandoning its ``poison
pill'' takeover defense and restructuring a $4.7 billion special
dividend to stockholders.
   The Chicago railroad, land and natural resources concern also
rebuffed Henley late last year when Henley offered to buy the
entire company for $63 a share, or $8.34 billion.
   Santa Fe's directors discussed the latest proposal with their
investment bankers and legal advisers and concluded the plan would
benefit only Henley, Santa Fe President Robert D. Krebs said in a
letter to Michael Dingman, Henley's chairman.
   ``That ownership percentage would transfer effective control of
the company without the payment of a control premium to our
shareholders,'' Krebs wrote. ``In addition, the offer would dilute
the interests of all our shareholders except for The Henley Group.''
   Henley's proposal would have given it 34.3 percent ownership of
Santa Fe. The La Jolla, Calif., manufacturing, engineering and
financial-services firm currently holds a 15.7 percent stake.
   Santa Fe stock rose 75 cents to $24.25 share Wednesday in New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   Krebs said in his letter to Dingman that Santa Fe's
special-dividend plan represented a better value to shareholders
than the alternative proposed by Henley.
   The rejected Henley proposal asked Santa Fe to stop the planned
March 1 payment of $5 per share in ``junk bonds'' for each of its
157.3 million shares. Santa Fe already has made a $25-per-share
cash payout as part of the special dividend.
   Henley contends the bonds will leave shareholders with a large
tax liability because of the way they are structured.
   Instead, Henley proposed that Santa Fe sell it $780 million
worth of new stock at $17.50 per share. Proceeds from that deal
would have been used to make a one-time $5-a-share cash payout to
all shareholders.
   Henley had also asked Santa Fe to void the poison pill takeover
defense it adopted in December.
   Under the defense, if any stockholder's stake exceeds 20
percent, other Santa Fe shareholders would be permitted to buy new
stock at half price, diluting the hostile buyer's stake and making
a takeover prohibitively expensive.
   Henley has said the takeover defense restricts the
maneuverability of major holders like itself and Toronto-based real
estate concern Olympia & York Developments Ltd.
   Olympia & York, which is controlled by Canada's Reichmann
family, has a 10.5 percent stake in Santa Fe. The company last week
launched a $17.50 a share million tender offer worth $245 million
to boost its holdings to 19.9 percent.
   Olympia & York had agreed to support Santa Fe's restructuring in
return for two seats on the Santa Fe board.
   Meanwhile, Henley is waging a proxy fight in hopes of gaining
control of Santa Fe's board of directors at the company's May 24
annual meeting, and is suing Santa Fe in Delaware, where both
companies are incorporated, to block the $4.7 billion special
dividend.

   U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker
said Thursday he was satisfied with the current exchange rates
between the dollar and the Japanese yen, according to Japanese
officials in Seoul.
   Baker reportedly expressed that view when he met with Japanese
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita in Seoul Thursday. Both were
attending the inauguration of South Korean President Roh Tae-woo.
   ``Efforts to stabilize the exchange rates have been
successful,'' a Japanese Foreign Ministry official quoted Baker as
telling Takeshita.
   The official, Haraguchi Koichi, said Baker predicted that the
slumping U.S. economy would recover soon and grow at least 2.5
percent this year.

<HEAD>Auto Sales Rise, Deficit Declines</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 6 grafs to UPDATE with revised estimate of
fourth-quarter GNP.; uppicks 3rd graf pvs: Exports rose...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy surged ahead at its fastest pace in two years _
a robust 4.5 percent annual rate _ in the last quarter of 1987, the
government said today.
   The Commerce Department's measure of growth in the gross
national product, the total output of goods and services, amounted
to an upward revision from a month ago, when the GNP was put at a
slightly slower 4.2 percent growth rate.
   Such a strong performance is usually considered good news, but
some economists fear this time may be an exception.
   They note that three-fourths of the $42 billion in growth in the
October-December quarter came from a $32.1 billion rise in business
inventories, which came as consumer spending was falling at its
fastest rate in more than seven years.
   That means production will have to be cut back sharply in coming
months to work down the excess inventories _ meaning the overall
economy will also probably slow as well in the first half of 1988.
   A separate report Wednesday offered encouraging news on another
front, however, when the Commerce Department said record exports
helped shrink the nation's trade deficit at the end of 1987.
   Exports rose 6 percent as the trade deficit narrowed to $40.2
billion on a balance-of-payments basis in the last three months of
the year, the department said. It was the first quarterly
improvement since the spring of 1986.
   ``We have a genuine export boom going on and I think a lot of
people are pleasantly surprised,'' Robert Ortner, undersecretary of
commerce for economic affairs, said in announcing the turnaround.
   In other economic news Wednesday, sales of U.S.-made cars and
light trucks jumped 14.5 percent in mid-February in a development
that analysts attributed to plentiful, aggressive buyer incentives.
   ``The consumer has more confidence in the economy than the
analysts do,'' said Chris Cedergren, industry analyst with J.D.
Power and Associates in Agoura Hills, Calif.
   The news had little impact on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones
average of 30 industrials edged up 0.83 point to 2,039.95. The Dow
fell 1.17 on Tuesday.
   Gold prices tumbled on expectations of continued low inflation.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid price for gold of
$432.80 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down $8.70 from Tuesday's
late level.
   The dollar, meanwhile, turned in a narrowly mixed performance on
the world's foreign-exchange markets. Bond prices edged marginally
lower as a major new issue of Treasury bonds waited in the wings.
   Ortner said further improvements in trade were likely in the
months ahead because of the beneficial effects of the cheaper
dollar, which has declined sharply in value since late 1985 as part
of a Reagan administration effort to thwart protectionist sentiment
in Congress.
   Still, the year finished with a record $159.3 billion
balance-of-payments trade deficit for all of 1987, the report said.
   In volume alone, the trade deficit actually showed a 5 percent
improvement from 1986 to 1987. The fact that import prices rose
more rapidly than export prices helped mask this improvement,
Commerce Department analysts said.
   The new figures confirmed an end-of-year narrowing of the trade
shortfall that already had shown up in the department's monthly
merchandise trade reports. The earlier figures showed a $43 billion
deficit for the fourth quarter and a $171.2 billion shortfall for
all of 1987.
   Wednesday's figures were smaller because they subtracted factors
such as the cost of shipping, insurance and military sales from the
monthly numbers. The balance-of-payments deficit is also adjusted
for seasonal variations; the monthly figures are not.

<HEAD>Fourth Quarter GNP Revised Upward</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew at a robust 4.5 percent
annual rate in the final three months of 1987, the fastest pace in
almost two years, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department's estimate of growth in the gross
national product, the total output of goods and services,
represented an upward revision from a month ago, when the GNP was
put at a slightly slower 4.2 percent growth rate.
   President Reagan, boasting about the country's longest peacetime
recovery on record, had given a small preview of today's good news
during his Wednesday night news conference. Reagan, who is briefed
on the economic figures in advance, said they would contain ``a
little good news.''
   Economic expansion at such a rapid clip would normally bring
cheers, but the lopsided nature of this increase is instead raising
concern among private economists that the recovery will weaken
considerably in the first half of 1988.
   Analysts base this forecast on the fact that three-fourths of
the $42 billion in growth in the October-December quarter came from
a $32.1 billion rise in business inventories, which came as
consumer spending was falling at its fastest rate in more than
seven years.
   This ominous combination means that production will have to be
cut back sharply in coming months to work down the excess
inventories.
   A buildup of inventories and weak consumer spending can trigger
a recession, but most economists believe that the country will be
able to escape a downturn this year although they are forecasting
very weak growth during the first six months.
   The rapid rate of growth in the fourth quarter was accompanied
by little pickup in inflation. A price index tied to the GNP was
rising at an annual rate of 3.7 percent in the fourth quarter,
compared to a 3.4 percent increase in the third quarter.
   The 4.5 percent increase in economic growth followed a gain of
4.3 percent in the third quarter and was the fastest advance since
a 5.4 percent rise in the first quarter of 1986.
   The fourth-quarter gain boosted growth for the year to 3.9
percent, when measured from the end of 1986, up slightly from the
3.8 percent estimate made a month ago.
   The Reagan administration is forecasting that growth this year
will slow to a rate of 2.4 percent. Many private economists believe
even this scaled-down figure is too optimistic.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Those analysts think that growth in the current January-March
quarter will slow to a barely discernible 1 percent rate _ or even
less. They expect a gradual strengthening for the rest of the year
as growth in export sales offsets a slowdown in consumer spending.
   The administration is expecting the country will get half of its
growth this year from an improving trade deficit as American
manufacturers continue to benefit from the decline in the value of
the dollar.
   The upward revision in GNP growth in the October-December
quarter came despite the fact that the shrinking in the trade
deficit was not as large as originally thought.
   The various changes added $42 billion to the total GNP, leaving
it at $3.877 trillion after adjusting for inflation.
   In addition to the big rise in business inventories, other
sources of strength included a 13.4 percent increase in government
spending and an 8.1 percent increase in housing construction.
   The trade deficit, after removing the effects of inflation,
improved as exports shot up by 15.1 percent, outpacing a 9.7
percent rise in imports.
   The 3.1 percent drop in consumer spending was the biggest
setback since a 5.4 percent drop in the first quarter of 1980, a
slowdown that occurred during the brief recession that year and
which has been cited as a contributing factor to Jimmy Carter's
defeat.
   The Reagan administration, wanting to keep the White House in
Republican hands, hopes that the big plunge in consumer spending
this time does not signal another recession.
   David Wyss, an economist with Data Resources Inc. of Lexington,
Mass., said he expected the GNP would rise at a sluggish pace of
1.4 percent this year as consumer spending, which accounts for
two-thirds of overall economic activity, slows appreciably.
   Wyss said economic growth in the current January-March quarter
is likely to slow to around 1 percent with the second quarter
possibly posting a negative number.
   However, he said the country will probably avoid a recession,
which is defined as at least two quarters of negative GNP growth,
because continued strength in American exports will offset the
weakness in consumer spending.
   Michael Evans, an economist for a Washington forecasting firm,
said he has changed from predicting a recession and now believes
the country has a 50-50 change of avoiding a downturn.
   He said a key bit of evidence will come with next week's release
of unemployment figures for February.
   ``If we had a big gain in employment in February, then the
chances of the consumer leading us into a recession are much weaker
than I thought,'' he said.

   Japan's inflation-adjusted consumer spending rose
1.9 percent in December from a year ago, the government reported
Thursday.
   Meanwhile, the government said the nation's major retailers saw
sales climb by 7.1 percent in January over the same month last year
on the strength of clothing purchases.
   The Statistics Bureau of the prime minister's office said
December's 1.9 percent consumer spending gain compared with an
adjusted 2 percent rise in November.
   Bureau officials said the December increases came largely in the
areas of education, utilities, clothing and entertainment.

<HEAD>Broken Hill Shareholders Approve Restructuring, Stock Buyback</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shareholders of Broken Hill
Proprietary Co. on Thursday approved a major restructuring of
Australia's largest company, which included the repurchase of most
BHP shares owned by its two biggest stockholders.
   Under the plan outlined late last month, Broken Hill will pay
2.1 billion Australian dollars, about $1.5 billion at current
exchange rates, to buy back 300 million BHP shares controlled by
financier Robert Holmes a Court, a persistent suitor for the
company.
   The buyback will reduce Holmes a Court's stake, held by his Bell
Resources conglomerate, to 10 percent from 29 percent.
   Broken Hill also plans to pay 575 million Australian dollars to
Elders IXL Ltd., a diversified company run by entrepreneur John
Elliott, for a 50 percent interest in an Elders unit that owns 19
percent of BHP, reducing Elliott's Broken Hill stake by half.
   Elliott and Holmes a Court also will resign from Broken Hill's
board of directors.
   The steel, oil and mining company, which has major holdings in
the United States, South America and elsewhere has been eager to
reduce the influence of both entrepreneurs, especially because of
Holmes a Court's repeated attempts in recent years to buy control
of the giant company.
   Elders had acquired its stake in Broken Hill in 1986 to thwart a
takeover attempt by Holmes a Court.
   Broken Hill also had been concerned that Holmes a Court and
Elliott might dump their shares following October's stock market
crash, depressing the company's stock price.
   Companies controlled by Holmes a Court lost about 500 million
Australian dollars in the stock market crash, the biggest corporate
loss in Australian history, due to investment writedowns. The
financier has been selling a number of assets to help ease cash
problems raised by the sharp decline in its market value during the
crash.
   Broken Hill is selling at least 1 billion Australian dollars
worth of non-strategic investments and assets to help finance its
restructuring, which was expected to cost 2.68 billion Australian
dollars, about $1.9 billion.
   Sir James Balderstone, chairman of Broken Hill, said the
restructuring would not be completed for several months.
   Balderstone said the plan would be completed once the
transactions with Holmes a Court and Elliott were settled, Broken
Hill shareholders approved the plan to cancel the 300 million
shares acquired from Holmes a Court and Australia's Supreme Court
approved the reduction in Broken Hill's capital.
   Broken Hill's plans received clearance Tuesday by Australian
securities regulators, who said they would not take any action
because shareholders of all companies involved were to vote on the
proposals.

   Sales of domestic cars and light trucks in
mid-February slowed from early in the month but jumped 14.5 percent
over the same period a year earlier, reflecting aggressive buyer
incentives offered by automakers.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
Wednesday reported healthy sales increases over a year earlier,
which were not shared by most foreign makers who build cars in this
country.
   ``They had a lot of help from incentives. I think that's pretty
evident looking at Chrysler's numbers. Chrysler has had huge
incentives,'' said Joseph Phillippi, an analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in New York.
   Total domestic car sales rose 11.9 percent in the nine selling
days from Feb. 11-20, while domestic truck sales, which increased
for all makers, jumped 19.6 percent as the surge in light-truck
popularity showed no sign of slowing.
   The eight companies building domestic vehicles sold 325,422 cars
and light trucks in mid-February, up from 284,278 a year earlier _
210,316 cars and 115,106 trucks, compared with 188,001 cars and
96,277 trucks a year earlier.
   But mid-February domestic car sales moved at a seasonally
adjusted rate of less than 7.8 million a year, down from an 8.4
million rate in early February.
   ``The consumer has more confidence in the economy than the
analysts do,'' said Chris Cedergren, industry analyst with J.D.
Power and Associates in Agoura Hills, Calif.
   ``All economic indicators point to lower sales for 1988 than
1987,'' Cedergren said. ``We do expect the downward trend to
continue.''
   Nevertheless, the Big Three have shown renewed optimism toward
the U.S. economy and vehicle market, increasing planned production
for 1988 in reverses of cuts planned after the stock market crash
in October.
   GM announced Wednesday it is restoring second shifts at three
plants, reopening a Framingham, Mass., assembly plant on one shift
and boosting overtime at other car and truck plants.
   The increases will put 8,600 laid-off workers back on the job
and will add 175,000 cars and trucks to GM's 1988 production
schedule.
   In mid-February, Chrysler led the Big Three in domestic car
sales increases with a 21.7 percent boost. Chrysler's domestic
truck sales rose even further, jumping 47.3 percent over
mid-February 1986.
   GM reported a 16.3 percent increase in domestic car sales and a
21.8 percent boost in domestic truck sales over mid-February a year
earlier. Ford's car sales rose 2.2 percent and truck sales
increased 5.4 percent.
   Ford's share of the domestic car market fell to 28.8 percent
from 31.5 percent a year earlier, while GM's share jumped to 50.7
percent from 48.8 percent a year earlier and Chrysler's share grew
to 15.5 percent from 14.3 percent a year earlier.
   Gains by GM and Chrysler were somewhat deceptive because both
had weaker sales in mid-February 1986 than Ford, and both have
needed to use incentives more aggressively than Ford this year,
Phillippi said.
   Sales of U.S.-built cars fell 4.5 percent for Honda Motor Co.,
23.9 percent for Volkswagen and 10.7 percent for Nissan Motor Corp.
   Toyota Motor Corp. sales of domestic cars rose 72.2 percent,
continuing a buildup from 1987. Toyota, like Mazda Motor Corp., has
only been building cars in the United States for a short time.
   Mazda began U.S. production in the fall at its Flat Rock
assembly plant.

   Oil prices tumbled substantially today,
reflecting growing market nervousness that world supplies are
increasing too fast.
   At midday, contracts for April delivery of West Texas
Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, stood at $16.03 per
42-gallon barrel, down 43 cents from Wednesday's close on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.
   Among March contracts for refined products, wholesale heating
oil was selling at 45.45 cents a gallon, down 0.95 cent from
Wednesday, while unleaded gasoline stood at 45.45 cents per gallon,
0.90 cent lower.
   Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders
Futures Inc., said fundamental and technical factors were pushing
the prices lower, with crude touching as little as $15.98 a barrel
at one point before struggling back.
   ``OPEC is producing about 1 million barrels a day more than it
was a month ago, and this perception is getting into the market _
which isn't thrilled by it,'' he said.
   Recent estimates have put production by members of the
Organization of petroleum Exporting Countries close to 18 million
barrels a day.
   Beutel said the slide also picked up after crude broke below
$16.37 a barrel, ``which had been seen as a very important support
level.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened lower

   New rains in the major soybean-growing region of Brazil prompted
selling of U.S. soybean futures, analysts said. Traders are

rapidly approaches.
   ``The thinking is that inevitably (U.S. soybean) prices will go
down as these crops come in, unless we get some major improvement
in demand, which is not likely,'' said Walter Spilka, an analyst
for Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. in New York.
   Corn futures failed to follow through on Wednesday's gains,
which were spurred by rumors of Soviet purchases of U.S. corn.
   The Agriculture Department announced after the close of trading
Wednesday that the Soviets had purchased 350,000 metric tons of
U.S. corn, an amount that Spilka said was ``not enough to carry the
markets very far.''
   Wheat futures slipped lower on a lack of fresh supportive news,
he said.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 1\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.16} a bushel; corn was { cent
to 1{ cents lower with March at $1.98 a bushel; oats were } cent to
1\ cents lower with March at $1.89{ a bushel; soybeans were 2{
cents to 4 cents ower with March at $6.22\ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed to lower in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .25 cent lower to .10 cent higher with April at
71.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .03 cent to .27 cent lower
with March at 80.80 a pound; live hogs were unchanged to .12 cent
lower with April at 44 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
unchanged to .47 cent higher with March at(52.45 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures closed mostly higher on Wednesday while pork
futures ended mixed.

   The stock market staged a strong advance today,
reviving its recent rally after sluggish showings in the past two
sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 27.69 to 2,067.64
by noontime on Wall Street, making a run at new highs since the

<HEAD>Harry Evans: From Fleet Street to Madison Avenue</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former top editor of one of the world's most
powerful newspapers has taken up a new challenge: to send people
packing.
   Harold Evans, who resigned as editor of The Times of London in
1982 in a dispute with owner Rupert Murdoch over editorial
independence, has changed his itinerary to become editor in chief
of a new travel magazine, Conde Nast's Traveler.
   Traveler, launched last fall by Conde Nast Publications Inc., a
division of privately-owned Newhouse Newspapers, already prides
itself in being different from the scores of other magazines aimed
at the booming travel industry.
   It is hard-hitting _ in the tradition of Fleet Street, not
Madison Avenue _ with pointed writing, vivid photographs, fold-out
maps and offbeat humor.
   Evans planned the magazine for Conde Nast starting in September
1986 _ following stints as editorial director of U.S. News & World
Report and editor in chief of Atlantic Monthly Press, a publishing
company.
   The 59-year-old ``Harry'' Evans has put his personal stamp on
Traveler, which has a full-time staff of around 40 and claims a
monthly circulation of some 900,000 copies. For starters, unlike
traditional travel magazines, Traveler doesn't allow its writers to
accept free trips or accommodations.
   ``We pay our own way; the plan is to be truthful,'' Evans said
in an interview in his office on Madison Avenue. ``We print things
without fear.''
   That policy has generated, for example, an investigative article
on airline safety and a report that 22 of 56 cruise liners failed
recent inspections by the U.S. Public Health Service.
   Such ``truth in travel'' has already had repercussions. Last
November, after Traveler printed a summary of a report by the World
Health Organization on air pollution in more than 50 cities around
the world, ads for VARIG Brazilian Airlines were pulled from the
magazine.
   The advertising agency for VARIG, Jonas Berger Associates, told
Traveler it cancelled the ads for Brazil's national airline because
it couldn't ``understand the logic in your telling your readers
about the pollution problem in Rio de Janeiro.''
   Evans, in turn, fired off an unrepentant editorial. ``Readers
are tired of fluff and puff,'' he wrote. ``They know it's a big
world where sometimes it's sunny and sometimes it rains. They want
to be stimulated, but they want to explore and enjoy with all the
facts and insights they can acquire.''
   The editor's pull-no-punches approach has led Traveler to take
other strong editorial stands _ advocating, for instance, efforts
to preserve wildlife in Africa and natural beauty spots in the
United States.
   The magazine's brash approach may have been emboldened by the
built-in circulation it inherited from its predecessor, Signature
magazine. Conde Nast, a titan of magazine publishing, bought
Signature in January 1987 from Citicorp Diner's Club for around $40
million _ then relaunched it as Traveler last September.
   Although Traveler is a completely new product, it picked up a
circulation of around 700,000 copies a month from the defunct
Signature.
   In its first four issues (from September through December of
last year), Traveler carried 198.5 advertising pages, bringing in
around $4.2 million in ad revenues, according to figures compiled
by the Publishers Information Bureau.
   Ronald Galotti, Traveler's publisher, said the magazine is
aiming for more than 500 ad pages this year, which would translate
into $12 million to $13 million in revenues. ``We're running very,
very much on target,'' he said.
   Travel & Leisure, a magazine owned by American Express Co. that
is the dominant force in the travel field, carried around 1,227
pages last year fetching $38.5 million.
   Evans seems to relish bridging the gap between his hard-knocks
newspaper upbringing and the upscale world of magazines. At work,
he is a whirling dervish of energy _ talking rapid-fire,
punctuating his remarks by jumping up to pull out documents and
magazines to illustrate his points, fretting over a technical
production problem. He seems to have brought the high-tension level
of a big-city newspaper to the normally more subdued environs of
magazine publishing.
   A native of Manchester in England's industrial north, he started
in 1954 as a reporter for the Manchester Evening News and later
became editor of The Northern Echo, a regional daily.
   Evans is no stranger to this country. Besides his more recent
jobs with U.S. News and Atlantic Monthly, he spent 15 months here
in 1984 on a journalism fellowship, advising and working on several
small-town newspapers. He also was an adviser to Gannett Co. Inc.,
which publishes USA Today.
   He has encouraged offbeat humor in Traveler _ like a guide to
shoe-shopping in Paris titled ``Confessions of a Shoe Fetishist''
and a regular feature called ``Room with a View'' profiling
specific hotel rooms. October's was Room 472 in the Hotel Splendido
in Portofino, Italy, where Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton
stayed in 1976.
   The magazine's style, with a breezy sophistication bordering on
snobbishness, has prompted some critics in publishing circles to
deride Traveler as ``Vanity Fair goes to the beach.'' The editor in
chief of Vanity Fair, another Conde Nast magazine that touts good
writing, is Tina Brown _ who is married to Evans.

   Traveler, a new monthly magazine launched by
Conde Nast Publications Inc., joins a crowded field of publications
aiming to tap the booming U.S. market for travel and Americans'
growing fascination with jet-set lifestyles.
   Americans spent a commanding $255 billion on domestic travel and
another $24.5 billion on trips abroad in 1986, according to the
U.S. Travel Data Center in Washington, D.C.
   The dominant magazine in the field, Travel & Leisure (owned by
American Express Co.), is being challenged by a legion of new or
reincarnated rivals for advertising dollars.
   In the past two years, according to Adweek magazine, the New
York Times has acquired and revamped Southern Travel, Reader's
Digest has purchased Travel@Holiday, publishing tycoon Rupert
Murdoch has taken over European Travel & Life, and CBS Inc.'s sale
of its magazine division has put Adventure Travel in the hands of
an investor group.
   Other contenders include Frequent Flyer, Connoisseur and
National Geographic. Banana Republic, a retail clothing chain owned
by The Gap Inc., plans a safari into the field next month with a
``hip'' new quarterly called Trips.

<HEAD>Banks Ready Bids for Mexico's New Foreign Debt Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign bankers are putting the finishing
touches on secret bids for bonds offered by Mexico in an innovative
scheme to get rid of some of its enormous foreign debt of $105
billion.
   The question for Mexico is how many of its approximately 560
creditor banks will submit bids under the program before the
deadline at 4 p.m. EST Friday.
   The plan was devised by the Mexican and U.S. governments to try
to reduce Mexico's heavy debt burden, the second highest in the
developing world after Brazil.
   Christine Bindert, senior vice president at the investment firm
of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York, said the program
``should be fairly successful with a lot of participation,
particularly from European and (U.S.) regional banks.''
   The big money center banks in the United States, though, were
expected to shun the program.
   ``They're bound to get some takers,'' said a European banker in
Mexico City, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The question
is: How many, and at what price?''
   The new program involves exchanging some of the debt Mexico owes
foreign commercial bankers for new, 20-year bonds that will be
issued by the government.
   The bonds, which will be backed by $10 billion worth of special
U.S. Treasury securities, will carry a higher interest rate than
Mexico is paying on the old debt.
   Analysts doubt the government will be able to market the entire
$10 billion package. Mexican officials, they say, would like to
sell at least $3 billion of the securities.
   The success of the program hinges on the sticky question of how
much the banks are willing to take for their old loans. In early
February, Mexican debt was selling for about 48 cents on the dollar
in the secondary market.
   In the auction, the bankers will try to get as much money as
they can for their old loans, while Mexico will want to buy the
debt cheaply.
   Analysts predict the average discount rate will range from 60
cents to 70 cents on the dollar.
   Some banks have expressed concern about the program because they
are unhappy that Mexico will still get loans at 100 percent of
their value while paying back, through the new program, its old
loans at less than that.
   They also are reluctant to accept losses on the loans and worry
about government regulations concerning accounting for the losses
on their books.
   Mexico's treasury secretary, Gustavo Petricioli, recently asked
U.S. officials to give ``the most favorable treatment possible'' to
banks taking part.
   The program will let Mexico retire part of its foreign debt for
less than face value and slice the $8 billion or so annual interest
fee on the debt.
   The banks are submitting sealed bids to J.P. Morgan & Co., the
New York banking company acting as exchange agent for the deal.
Morgan said earlier this week that it had already received some
offers, but it declined to release any details.
   Mexico is expected to announce next week how many _ if any _
bonds will be issued. Officials have said that if the offers are
not good enough, they may reject all of them.
   As the deadline neared this week, many bankers were reluctant to
say if they would bid.
   ``We're still studying the program in terms of our own
participation,'' said James H. Mitchell, spokesman for Bank of
America in San Francisco.
   In London, none of Britain's big four commercial banks would say
whether they planned to bid.
   ``We haven't said what we're going to do,'' said an official at
Lloyds Bank. Added an official at National Westminster Bank, ``Our
decision hasn't been made yet.'' Both demanded anonymity.
   Analysts expect smaller banks, worried about holding Mexican
debt, to use the program as a way to get out of international
lending.
   The chairman of Britain's Midland Bank, Sir Kit McMahon, found
the plan inappropriate for banks wanting to remain in the business
because it involves explicitly accepting that the debt is worth
less than its face value, a spokesman said.
   That echoed comments by John Reed, chairman of Citicorp, the
biggest bank-holding company in the United States. ``We're
long-term lenders, and we're happy with our portfolio,'' he said.
   ``The bonds being offered are good ideas for banks who want to
get out of lending to Latin America and provide a good way for
those institutions to lower their exposure to Third World
countries,'' Reed told the New York Times.
   However, West Germany's largest bank, the Deutsche Bank, said it
would bid for the bonds.
   ``There had been so many proposals to solve this problem,'' said
spokesman Hans Dettmar. ``Finally this plan comes up. It's a new
approach, and we want to see how it works.''
   Japanese banks also were close-mouthed about their plans.
   In Tokyo, an official of a major bank said no decision had yet
been made. ``But I think that even if we do participate, it will
not be in a very aggressive manner,'' he said, demanding anonymity.

   A Conrail engineer convicted of manslaughter
after a train crash that killed 16 people said today drug and
alcohol abuse are a major problem in the railroad industry and
random testing of rail workers is needed.
   ``I believe that random drug and alcohol testing is the
appropriate response to an industry-wide problem,'' the engineer,
Ricky L. Gates, said in testimony to the Senate Commerce Committee.
   Gates has pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the Jan. 4, 1987,
crash in which the Conrail locomotive he was driving slammed into a
crowded Amtrak train near Chase, Md. Sixteen people were killed and
175 were hurt in the crash.
   Gates has admitted he smoked marijuana shortly before the
accident. The National Transportation Safety Board has said that
marijuana use by Gates and his brakeman, Edward W. Cromwell, was
the primary cause of the accident.
   ``While the act of using the marijuana contributed to his
inattentiveness, there is no proof that Mr. Gates was impaired,''
one of Gates' lawyers, Donna Shearer, said in testimony for the
Senate committee.
   ``I cannot begin to imagine the pain and grief I have caused
those touched by the accident,'' said the statement by Gates, who
faces sentencing March 29. ``I am sorry.''
   Gates said railroad management ``often looks the other way''
when a worker has a drug or alcohol problem. ``I know this because
once when I was called to work ... I told the dispatcher that I was
intoxicated and could not work,'' he said. ``I was told if I did
not report I would be cited for refusing duty.''
   ``I believe that drug and alcohol use is widespread in the
industry,'' Gates said.
   Conrail spokesman Pat Linsky said the railroad was studying
Gates' remarks, and would have no immediate comment.
   The Senate last year approved legislation that would require
various types of drug and alcohol testing of rail, airline,
trucking and bus company employees. But the House has yet to act on
similar legislation.
   The most controversial type of testing proposed is random
testing of transportation workers. Supporters say random testing is
the only true deterrent to drug and alcohol abuse, while opponents
say such testing is an invasion of privacy and is often inaccurate.
   Earlier this month, a federal court in San Francisco ruled that
testing rail workers involved in accidents based on a suspicion
that they had recently used drugs or alcohol is illegal.
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., chairman of the Senate panel,
expressed frustration that the House has so far not approved a bill
requiring drug and alcohol testing of transportation workers.
   ``No one has a constitutional right to drive under the
influence, or fly under the influence,'' he said.

   Share prices closed sharply higher Thursday as
trading volume picked up to its best level in several weeks.
   Dealers said moderately bullish company earnings reports spurred
good buying interest by financial institutions. Price rises
accelerated further in the afternoon in response to impressive
gains in early Wall Street trading.
   ``The momentum is very strong,'' a dealer said.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 22.3 points, or 1.27 percent, at 1782.4, its best level for
the day. The index opened in positive territory and rose steadily
throughout the day, picking up steam after New York began trading.
   Share prices were boosted by good earnings reports from Royal
Insurance PLC, Imperial Chemical Industries PLC and British Telecom
PLC. The results helped allay fears that companies' profitability
might have suffered significantly as a result of the October stock
crash, dealers said.

<HEAD>Turner: Cable Operators To Get TBS Stock Instead Of Cash Dividend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable operators that own part of Turner
Broadcasting System Inc. have tentatively agreed to accept $35
million in stock instead of a cash dividend payment, TBS Chairman
Ted Turner said.
   ``This will give us some breathing room,'' Turner told reporters
Tuesday after addressing a business group. ``We are drawing up the
documents now, but we think we've got it nailed down.''
   A group of about 30 cable operators invested $560 million in
Turner Broadcasting last year and is due to receive the dividend in
April. The operators also were given seven seats on the 15-member
TBS board of directors.
   Under the original agreement, TBS had to pay the dividend within
six months of April 15 or give the cable operators two more seats
on the board. One cable operator said the original investment was
drawn up under the impression that Turner Broadcasting's $1.4
billion in debt would be refinanced by this time.
   Much of the debt stems from Turner's purchase of the
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film library, which has become a staple of
programming on the TBS cable channel. The debt carries a 16.5
percent interest rate.
   Turner has said his company was close to a refinancing agreement
early last fall, but the stock market plunge in October made it
impossible to work out a favorable deal.
   Under what Turner called an ``agreement in principle,'' Turner
Broadcasting would pay the dividend with shares of its Class B
stock, which closed Tuesday at $8 per share on the American Stock
Exchange. At that price, Turner's equity ownership in TBS would
fall to about 49.7 percent from the current 51 percent.
   The Class B stock was created so that TBS could use it for
business transactions such as paying the dividend without causing
Turner to lose voting control of the company.
   The deal would cause virtually no dilution of Turner's 68
percent voting stake in the company.

   Median family income rose 20 percent from 1970
to 1986 when adjusted for inflation and family size, but the gains
were uneven and families with children fared worse than other
groups such as the elderly, according to a congressional study
released Thursday.
   The mixed news came from the non-partisan Congressional Budget
Office in an analysis that contradicts a widespread impression,
based on other studies, that family income has stopped growing.
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., one of those who sought the CBO
report, said it suggests positive general trends in family income.
But Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., who made a separate request for
the analysis, said it contained plenty of bad news as well.
   ``Even among those families for whom incomes rose, CBO found
that the principal reason among the non-elderly was the increased
number of workers per family. In many families, both parents must
now work to maintain the standard of living,'' said Miller, who
released the report at a hearing of the House Select Committee on
Children, Youth and Families, which he chairs.
   Miller also cited CBO findings that young families, low-income
families with children and poor single-parent families in 1986 were
much poorer than their counterparts in 1970.
   Nearly half the overall 20 percent increase in family income
occurred between 1970 and 1973, according to an analysis of the CBO
data by Miller's committee staff. The staff also said virtually all
the remaining growth occurred since 1982.
   Among the CBO findings:
   _Median adjusted family income for families headed by people
over 65 grew by more than 50 percent over the 16-year-period. But
for married couples with children it grew only 26 percent; for
single mothers with children, it rose 2 percent; and for families
headed by people under 25, it dropped nearly 20 percent _ with the
entire decline coming since 1979.
   _Median adjusted family income rose between 12 percent and 37
percent for all families with at least one full-time, year-round
worker. For families with children and no such worker, it fell 10
percent.
   _Median adjusted family income fell 13 percent for low-income
single mothers with children, with one-fifth of such families
having less than half the income needed to live at the poverty
level in 1986.
   CBO said the elderly as a group were most protected from the
tides of the economy, while the fortunes of others rose and fell
with recessions and upswings throughout the period.
   Much of the rapid growth of income among the elderly was due to
higher Social Security payments, the office said. Income growth in
other groups was spurred by a rise in two-worker families, which
``offset the fact that earnings did not keep pace with inflation
for some workers,'' CBO said.
   Domenici, ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee and
a member of the new National Economic Commission, called the trends
among single-parent families ``disturbing but not surprising.'' He
said any deficit reduction plans would be carefully examined for
their impact on households headed by young or single parents.
   However, Domenici said the trends for some vulnerable family
groups would have been less negative if CBO had included non-cash
benefit programs such as food stamps, and the 1986 tax law which
took many low-income families off the tax rolls.
   CBO said its assessment differs from earlier, more pessimistic
ones because it made adjustments for smaller family size and used a
more accurate inflation index. Without those adjustments, the
office said, the trend would have been a 4 percent drop in family
income rather than a 20 percent boost.
   The office said lack of family-level data precluded adjustments
for non-cash programs, which have improved the situation of
low-income families, and tax hikes before 1981, which shrank
disposable income. CBO said it was impossible to project the net
effect of either omission.

<HEAD>Rain in Brazil Pressures Soybean Futures; Grains Mostly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Indications that the Brazilian soybean crop may
be larger than expected sent U.S. soybean futures prices down
modestly Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade. Grain futures
closed mixed to lower.
   Soybean futures opened lower on news that rain had eased dry
conditions in the soybean-growing region of Brazil. Later in the
morning, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics
estimated the impending harvest would yield 19.4 million metric
tons, significantly higher than the U.S. Agriculture Department's
latest estimate of 18.5 million metric tons.
   ``This estimate was obviously negative for the U.S. market, and
it took off any rallying attempt the beans might have had,'' said
Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York for Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co.
   Grain and soybean futures also retreated in reaction to
generally lower prices for other commodities, Spilka said.
   Losses in corn were limited by expectations of new Soviet
purchases, he said.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.18 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to { cent lower with March at $1.98{ a bushel; oats were
{ cent lower to } cent higher with March at $1.90} a bushel;
soybeans were 1{ cents to 3\ cents lower with March at $6.22 a

   An afternoon wave of selling wiped out strong
early gains in the stock market today, leaving prices with uneven
losses.
   Analysts said the market seemed to hit a stone wall of
resistance as it made a bid to climb to new highs since last
October's crash.
   Before the opening the Commerce Department said the nation's
gross nation product grew at a 4.5 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation, in the fourth quarter of last year.
   The department had previously estimated the pace of growth for
the October-December period at 4.2 percent.
   The upward revision was somewhat smaller than some analysts had
been expecting, however, and traders in both the stock and bond
markets seemed uncertain how to respond to the news.
   The late drop meant that the Dow Jones industrial average failed
to close above the 2,051.89 mark it reached on Jan. 7, which stands
as its closing high since the crash.

   Assets of the nation's 418 money market mutual
funds climbed $2.56 billion in the latest week to a record high
level of nearly $280 billion, the Investment Company Institute said
Thursday.
   The rise, to $279.99 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised $608 million decline in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The previous week's decline had originally been reported as
$1.19 billion.
   The latest gain leaves the fund's assets at their highest level
ever, surpassing the previous high mark of $278.04 billion in the
week ended Feb. 10.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 208 general purpose funds fell $522.8 million to $81.44
billion, assets of 97 broker-dealer funds rose $1.07 billion to
$115.52 billion and assets of 113 institutional funds jumped $2.01
billion to $83.02 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 6.16 percent from 6.14 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell, to 6.23 percent from 6.28
percent, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
43 days, up from 42 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts slipped
to 5.75 percent as of Wednesday from 5.76 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged from the previous week at 5.17 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 6.88
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 6.92 the
previous week. Yields were 7.20 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
7.23 percent; 7.62 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.64 percent;
and 8.08 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.10 percent.

<HEAD>Texas Oilmen Bid For USG, But Market Reaction Skeptical</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USG Corp. kept quiet Thursday about two Texas
oilmen's $1.96 billion takeover attempt of the nation's largest
producer of gypsum, an important building material.
   ``At this time, we have nothing to say on any aspect of this,''
said Paul Colitti, a spokesman for Chicago-based USG.
   Desert Partners L.P., controlled by oilmen Cyril Wagner Jr. and
Jack E. Brown, said Wednesday it would pay $42 a share in cash for
at least 21.5 million common shares, or less than half the total
shares outstanding.
   The rest of the shares would be exchanged for subordinated debt
securities and warrants valued by Desert Partners at $42 a share.
   Analysts didn't give the proposal much chance of success because
of USG's previously stated desire to avoid dealing with Wagner and
Brown, takeover strategists who have made forays against several
companies.
   Some suggested the partners might be seeking a way to increase
the value of their 9.9 percent stake in the company, purchased last
fall at between $44 and $45 a share, so they could sell it with
minimal loss.
   Investor reaction to the bid was skeptical. USG's stock, which
rose $4.62{ Wednesday to $37 in composite New York Stock Exchange
trading, fell back to $35.87{ Thursday.
   In a letter to Robert J. Day, USG chairman and chief executive
officer, Desert Partners said it is genuinely interested in
acquiring the company and will refuse to accept ``greenmail'' _ the
purchase of its USG stock at a premium over the market price _ from
USG.
   The company produces gypsum and gypsum-related products in about
100 plants nationwide. Gypsum is a mineral component of plaster and
other building materials.
   ``We're hopeful, now that we've made a specific proposal, that
USG's board, recognizing its fiduciary responsibilities, will give
it serious consideration,'' said Joel Reed, president of a Desert
Partners subsidiary formed to try to acquire USG.
   In November, USG senior management said it had no interest in
participating in a buyout of the company with Desert Partners.
   The latest proposal came after a federal judge in Chicago on
Monday blocked USG's request to permanently bar Desert Partners
from buying additional USG shares.
   Last week, Mesa Limited Partners, headed by corporate raider T.
Boone Pickens, disclosed its 1.5 percent stake in USG.
   Several years ago, Wagner and Brown teamed with Pickens in a
number of takeover attempts, but Desert Partners has denied that
the parties have joined to gain control of USG this time.
   In its letter, Desert Partners said it has invested about $225
million, or about $44.30 a share, to accumulate its stake in USG.
The partnership owns about 5.08 million common shares.

   Eastman Kodak Co., under fire for purportedly
overpaying in its $5.1 billion acquisition of Sterling Drug Inc.,
said Thursday it expects to earn profits ``well in excess'' of the
amount predicted by Wall Street analysts.
   The effort to whip up enthusiasm fell short. Kodak was the most
actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday but
managed to rise only 62{ cents a share to $42. The stock had traded
at $49.12{ just before the Sterling deal was announced.
   Analysts had lowered their 1988 earnings projections for Kodak
by about 35 cents a share since Jan. 1, prompted mainly by Kodak's
announcement last month of the agreement to buy Sterling, the New
York-based maker of Bayer aspirin, Lysol cleaner and prescription
drugs.
   ``Based on what we have learned from Sterling and what we know
about Kodak, we believe that reduction can be put back into
analysts' estimates,'' Kodak President Kay R. Whitmore said in a
prepared statement.
   ``We're very optimistic about the future,'' the president added
in an interview.
   Kodak did not speak out on Sterling until this week because its
tender offer for Sterling shares was still pending. The offer
expired Monday and Kodak is mopping up the final details of the
acquisition.
   Analysts who follow Rochester, N.Y.-based Kodak had continued to
cut their earnings estimates as recently as Wednesday.
   On Thursday, analyst Eugene Glazer of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
said Kodak seemed to be trying to convince analysts that the
company would earn $4 a share or more in profit in 1987. He said he
was likely to raise his own estimate of $3.85 a share.
   Last year operating earnings were about $6.31 a share, although
various special charges reduced net earnings to $3.52 a share.
   The heavy load of debt Kodak took on to finance the Sterling
purchase helped convince both Standard & Poor's Corp. and Moody's
Investors Service to lower their credit ratings on the company to
the lowest levels in its modern history.
   Kodak has run into other troubles recently:
   _Polaroid Corp. disclosed that it is seeking $5.7 billion in
damages for Kodak's infringement on its instant photography patents.
   _A federal judge issued a temporary injunction blocking Kodak's
merger of its photofinishing operations with the Colorcraft Corp.
photofinishing operations of Fuqua Industries Inc.
   _Kodak admitted that its innovative 9-volt lithium batteries,
which were supposed to have a shelf life of 10 years, don't last
that long.
   Whitmore said the purchase of Sterling was consistent with
Kodak's strategy for chemical sciences, would give the company a
``highly profitable revenue stream'' and offers opportunities for
cutting costs by eliminating overlaps.
   ``So _ recognizing what we're receiving _ the price we paid is
competitive, fair and indicative of Sterling's inherent value to
us,'' Whitmore said in his prepared remarks.
   ``We now expect that the earnings we report for 1988 will meet
or exceed (Wall) Street's pre-merger consensus, even after taking
into account the dilutive effect of the Sterling merger,'' Whitmore
said.

<HEAD>Britoil Drops Resistance to BP Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britoil PLC on Thursday dropped resistance to
British Petroleum Co. PLC's $4.4 billion takeover offer for the
North Sea oil company even though Britoil still believes the price
is inadequate.
   Britoil's board of directors said it was advising shareholders
to accept the offer of $8.80 a share for Britoil's 504 million
shares outstanding.
   The Britoil board had vigorously opposed the company's takeover
by BP, which controls 81 percent of Britoil's stock.
   The government announced on Tuesday that it wouldn't use its
special share in Britoil to block the offer, as long as BP kept
promises to meet certain conditions.
   Among them were that BP would maintain the headquarters for some
of Britoil's operations in Glasgow, Scotland.
   The government had retained the special share _ which gives it
the veto power over the company's affairs _ when it privatized
Britoil in two stages in 1985 and 1982.
   Britoil Chairman Sir Philip Shelbourne said in a letter to
shareholders: ``Your board continues to believe that 500 pence
($8.80) represents an inadequate price for an ordinary share in
Britoil, but there are now considerable uncertainties confronting
shareholders who might wish to remain a minority in Britoil.''
   He said the continued listing of the company's shares could not
be guaranteed and that the market value of the shares would likely
fall after the BP offer closes.
   The offer currently is open indefinitely.
   Britoil's shares finished unchanged at 498 pence or $8.76 on the
London Stock Exchange Thursday.

<HEAD>Narrow Measure of Money Supply Falls; Broader Measures Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's basic money supply fell $1.1
billion in mid February, while two broader measures, M2 and M3,
rose by $6.3 billion and $11.7 billion respectively, the Federal
Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said M1 fell to a seasonally adjusted $759.9 billion in
the week ended Feb. 17 from $761 billion the previous week. M1
includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and
non-bank travelers checks.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $755.4 billion, a 2.1
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks.
   Since early 1987, the Fed has not set a specific target range
for M1 growth because of ``uncertainties about its underlying
relationship to the behavior of the economy and its sensitivity to
a variety of economic and financial circumstances and assumptions.''
   M2, made up of M1 and such accounts as savings deposits and
money-market mutual funds, rose to a seasonally adjusted average of
$2,945.7 billion in the week ended Feb. 17. This compared with a
revised $2,939.4 billion the previous week, which was originally
reported as $2,939.9, the Fed said.
   For the latest 13 weeks, it averaged $2,915.8 billion, growing
at a 4.1 percent rate of gain.
   M3, the sum of M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as
certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $100,000, rose
to a seasonally adjusted average of $3,722.7 billion in the same
period.
   This compared with a revised $3,711 billion in the previous
week, which originally reported as $3,712 billion, the Fed said.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M3 has averaged $3,680 billion, growing
at a 5.1 percent rate of gain from the week earlier, the Fed said.
   The Fed said in early 1988 that it would like annual growth for
Ms and M3 to be between 4 percent and 8 percent, which is slightly
lower than the 1987 target of 5.5 percent to 8.5 percent.
   Analysts warned that it is difficult to draw short-term
conclusions about the meaning of the three figures, because they
are inclined to be volatile on a week-to-week basis.
   Beth Reiners, an analyst at the Dean Witter Reynolds securities
firm, said the data were mainly in line with the company's
expectations, and had no impact on the bond market.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks rose $433 million in
the week ended Feb. 17, compared with a decline of $368 million a
week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System averaged $132 million a day in the week ended
Wednesday, down from $254 million in the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the

   The dollar turned in a narrowly mixed
performance Thursday on the world's foreign-exchange markets,
slipping against major currencies in U.S. trading after edging up
against most of them in dealings in Europe.
   Gold prices edged up in New York after falling sharply in Europe.
   Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid price for
gold of $433 a troy ounce, up 20 cents from Wednesday's late bid.
   The dollar rose in Europe on expectations that the U.S.
government would revise its estimate of growth in the gross
national product for the fourth quarter of 1987 to 5 percent from
4.2 percent.
   But the report, released in the middle of the European trading
day, put the latest estimate of fourth-quarter economic growth at
4.5 percent.
   As a result, the dollar turned lower, finishing the day in New
York at lower levels than it traded at late Wednesday.
   Dan Holland, a vice president at Discount Corp. in New York,
said some traders bought dollars before the trade report was
released because they interpreted President Reagan's comments on
the economy at a news conference Wednesday night as indicating
growth had been stronger than expected.
   But, he said, once the report was released and the revision was
only modest, some dollar traders sold the U.S. currency.
   Jack Barbanel, senior vice president at Gruntal & Co., said the
dollar took its cues from the bond market where a rally faltered at
midday.
   ``There is a considerable amount of confusion in the financial
markets'' about the strength of the econonmy, he said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.05 Japanese yen to close at 128.80 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 128.67 yen. In New York, the
dollar slipped to 128.425 yen from 128.82 yen late Wednesday.
   In London, the dollar slipped against the British pound, which
rose to $1.7665 from $1.7640 late Wednesday. The dollar also
slipped against the pound in New York, where sterling rose to
$1.76725 from $1.76355 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Wednesday, included: 1.6930 West German marks, down from 1.69575;
1.39215 Swiss francs, down from 1.39535; 5.7285 French francs, down
from 5.7340; 1,247 Italian lire, down from 1,248; and 1.26495
Canadian dollars, down from 1.26505.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Wednesday,
included: 1.6945 West German marks, up from 1.6925; 1.3935 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3908; 5.7315 French francs, up from 5.7240;
1.9020 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8990; 1,248.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,246.25; and 1.2650 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2651.
   Gold prices edged up in the United States after tumbling in Asia
and Europe.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
rose $1.30 a troy ounce to $433.20.
   In London, gold fell to $428 per troy ounce from $434.70 late
Wednesday. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold fell to $433 an ounce from
$434.70 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $7.85 an ounce to close at
$436.35.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at $6.15 a troy ounce, compared with $6.26 late
Wednesday.
   On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery rose 5.3 cents
an ounce to $6.243.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday signaled to foreign governments that the United States
remains concerned about markets that have been closed or severely
limited to U.S. telecommunications manufacturers.
   The FCC stopped short of taking action that would reciprocally
exclude or limit foreign-owned companies from participating in the
U.S. market, though Chairman Dennis R. Patrick said such measures
``are still very much open, very much alive'' at the commission.
   The FCC said it needs more information on the trade imbalance
and ordered large long-distance and local phone companies to report
annually to the agency on big equipment purchases, including
switches and transmission equipment.
   ``By seeking this information we in no way imply an opposition
to foreign participation in U.S. markets,'' said FCC Chairman
Dennis R. Patrick. ``We believe in the economic utility of free
trade and in the proposition that, through that free trade,
consumers in the United States benefit by access to goods and
services that are provided by concerns around the world.
   ``However, we also believe in the principle of reciprocity and
there ought to be equally open markets in other parts of the
world,'' he said.
   The U.S. telecommunications equipment trade deficit is about $2
billion annually, the FCC said.
   Japan, Germany and France are among the countries whose
telecommunications trade policies have contributed heavily to the
deficit.
   The FCC will require annual reports from the country's seven
largest long-distance companies as well as the local Bell and large
independent companies. It also will require interstate carriers
that are 15 percent or more owned by foreign interests to file
annual revenue and traffic reports.
   The reporting requirements were proposed in December 1986 by
then-Chairman Mark S. Fowler. At the time, the commission also
sought comments on steps the FCC could take in pressuring foreign
countries to open their markets.
   Fowler, now in private law practice in Washington, said there is
no need at this time to change U.S. trade policy in reaction to
closed foreign markets, but ``by leaving the question open, there's
the spectre of further government action.''
   His intention in initiating the proposal was to put foreign
governments on notice of the U.S. concerns, he said.
   ``The only way we could get some countries' attention was to hit
them over the head with a threat,'' he said, adding, ``There's more
utility in making the threat than in implenting it.''

<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines and flight
attendants bargained intensively Thursday to avert a weekend
strike, but a union representing the workers said a walkout
appeared likely.
   ``There's a 100 percent chance of a strike,'' said William
Genoese, director of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters
Airline Division. ``As far as I'm concerned we're on a collision
course with Northwest Airlines to strike.''
   Flight attendants were preparing to strike at midnight Friday if
an agreement wasn't reached.
   Airline spokesman Redmond Tyler said progress is being made on
some major contract issues. The two sides have been meeting since
Tuesday at Northwest's world headquarters with the assistance of a
federal mediator, Tyler said.
   Senority wage scales, pensions and work rules are among the
major issues in the dispute. Former Republic Airlines flight
attendants have been working under their old contract since
Northwest acquired Republic in 1986. The company is trying to bring
the workers under one contract.
   ``We believe we're making substantial progress at the bargaining
table,'' Tyler said. ``We're not Jimmy the Greek, but we continue
to believe that we will get this resolved without a strike.''
   The national president of the International Association of
Machinists has vowed his union's support of the flight attendants,
but stopped short of saying machinists would honor picket lines.
Officials at national and local IAM offices did not return
telephone calls for clarification.
   Tyler said machinists are under a contract that forbids them to
strike in sympathy with another union. ``We expect our machinists
to honor their contract,'' he said.
   Pilots are forbidden from sympathy strikes under provisions of
the Railway Labor Act, Tyler said.
   Asked if those workers would be lockd out if they walk off their
jobs in sympathy with the flight attendants, Tyler said, ``We won't
address that because we don't want to play that `what if?' game.''
   Genoese said flight attendants would have the full backing of
the international Teamsters, which could result in delays of supply
shipments from truckers.
   Industry analysts were skeptical of the Teamsters power to
disrupt Northwest. Anthony Hatch, an airline industry analyst for
Argus Research of New York, said Genoese is ``overblowing the role
the teamsters play in an airline.''
   ``It's pilots and machinists that shut down an airline and
nothing else,'' Hatch said.
   Tyler said the airline is armed with about 2,000 management
workers who are certified as flight attendants to step if the 6,700
union flight attendants strike.

   The Teamsters union considers employee-led
buyouts of airlines and other companies as part of its ``global
strategy,'' but has no concrete buyout proposals, the president of
the Teamsters airline division said Thursday.
   William Genoese, responding to questions at a news conference,
said the union was studying the possibility of leveraged buyouts or
friendly takeovers of Pan American World Airways, Northwest
Airlines and USAir.
   But he characterized any employee-led buyouts as mere
possibilities under the Teamsters' long-term strategy rather than
as certainties.
   Also, two investment bankers mentioned by Genoese said they were
not working on any airline takeover proposals with the Teamsters.
   Genoese said discussion of union-led buyouts was not a ploy, but
he conceded that ``the threat of it will help you in negotiations.''
   Negotiations between Pan Am and the Teamsters, which represents
4,500 Pan Am ground employees in 14 cities, over $35 million in
concessions broke down on Sunday.
   Although the union had set a strike deadline for that night, its
members have continued reporting to work. Genoese has said a strike
remains possible and has threatened to disrupt Pan Am ground
operations.
   Pan Am has said it needed a total of about $540 million in
concessions from all its unionized employees during the next three
years to ensure its survival.
   Northwest is negotiating with its flight attendants on a new
contract an faces a midnight EST Friday strike deadline. Genoese
spoke at a news conference about the likelihood of a strike by
Northwest attendants, who also are represented by the Teamsters.
   Genoese said he had spoken recently with experts at the
investment firms of Salomon Brothers Inc. and Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. about how to finance airline buyouts.
   Drexel was an adviser to the coalition of four Pan Am unions
that unsuccessfully attempted to find a buyer for the financially
troubled airline last year, but says it has not dealt exclusively
with the Teamsters in that regard.
   Robert Salomon, a managing director of Salomon Brothers, said he
was unaware of any contact between the Teamsters and Salomon
regarding airline buyouts.
   Genoese also said he had spoken Monday with Jay Pritzker,
chairman of Braniff Inc., about a possible joint bid for Pan Am.
Braniff in January dropped a proposal to acquire major elements of
Pan Am Corp., the airline's parent, after the Pan Am pilots union
decided to oppose the plan, which called for $800 million in wage
concessions over four years from the company's unions.
   Pritzker, through a spokeswoman at his Chicago office, declined
to comment.
   Genoese said that by considering employee-led buyouts the union
simply was examining the same financing techniques used by Wall
Street takeover artists.
   ``You can do the financial end as well as (takeover strategist)
Carl Icahn and be good to the people,'' Genoese said. ``You're
going to see some of these moves pretty soon in the papers.''

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Tumble On Speculation Supplies Will Ease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Coffee futures prices fell sharply Thursday, reversing a
five-month trend on speculation that a tight supply situation may
soon ease, analysts said.
   On other markets, energy futures prices dropped; grains and
soybeans moved lower; precious metals gained slightly; livestock
and meat futures were mostly higher; and stock-index futures
retreated.
   Coffee contracts on New York's Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange
lost as much as 2.87 cents a pound as the executive committee of
the International Coffee Organzation opened a two-day meeting in
London.
   At that meeting, delegates from consumer nations complained of
slow shipments of high-quality beans from producer nations and
claimed some producer nations had sold coffee at discounted prices
to non-member nations, said Sandra Kaul, an analyst in New York for
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The apparent willingess of some producers to sell coffee at a
discount, along with news that Colombia had begun registering
coffee for export in April, suggests an easing of supplies, Ms.
Kaul said.
   ``This indicates that the short-term supply situation that
pushed the market up so sharply is about to come to an end at the
same time that seasonal demand eases,'' she said.
   In addition, analyst Kim Badenhop of Prudential-Bache Securities
noted that coffee prices were nearing levels that could trigger a
relaxation of ICO export quotas and increase shipments.
   Coffee settled 2 cents to 2.87 cents lower with the contract for
delivery in March at $1.3829 a pound.
   Crude oil futures slipped below $16 a barrel while gasoline and
heating oil prices fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   A Department of Energy report issued Wednesday showing an
8.5-million-barrel increase in U.S. oil stocks triggered the
sell-off, said Bob Baker, an analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   But Peter Beutel of Elders Futures Inc. linked the price decline
to perceptions of rising oil production by OPEC members.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 40 cents to 50 cents
lower with February at $15.36 a barrel; heating oil was 1.18 cents
to 1.25 cents lower with March at 45.22 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .98 cent to 1.10 cents lower with March at 45.37 cents
a gallon.
   Indications that the Brazilian soybean crop may be larger than
expected sent U.S. soybean futures prices down sharply on the
Chicago Board of Trade. Most grain futures declined slightly.
   Soybean futures opened lower on news that rain had eased dry
conditions in the soybean-growing region of Brazil. Later in the
morning, the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics
estimated the impending harvest would yield 19.4 million metric
tons, significantly higher than the U.S. Agriculture Department's
latest estimate of 18.5 million metric tons.
   ``This estimate was obviously negative for the U.S. market, and
it took off any rallying attempt the beans might have had,'' said
Walter Spilka, an analyst in New York for Smith Barney, Harris
Upham & Co.
   Wheat settled 1} cents lower to } cent higher with March at
$3.17} a bushel; corn was \ cent to } cent lower with March at
$1.98{ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to } cent higher with March
at $1.91 a bushel; soybeans were 3} cents to 8 cents lower with
March at $6.21 a bushel.
   Gold and silver futures posted modest gains on New York's
Commodity Exchange after two days of steep losses.
   The precious metals are caught in tug-of-war between bulls who
believe inflation is set to rise and bears who feel a recession is
near, said Jack Barbanel, an analyst for Gruntal & Co.
   ``It's a very volatile marketplace,'' he said.
   Gold settled 60 cents to $1.30 higher with April at $434.70 a
troy ounce; silver was 4.9 cents to 5.2 cents higher with March at
$6.245 a troy ounce.
   Most livestock and meat futures advanced on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   The cattle market was choppy but ended higher on improved demand
from packers, while pork prices rose on expectations for stronger
cash markets next week, said Philip Stanley, an analyst in Chicago
for Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent to .40 cent higher with April at
72.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent lower to .25 cent
higher with March at 80.67 cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to
.25 cent higher with April at 44.12 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .12 cent to .60 cent higher with March at 52.57 cents
a pound.
   Stock-index futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled 2.35 points lower at 262.85. The
underlying spot index was down 2.86 points at 261.58.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of angry, sign-waving
workers protesting the possible sale of Chrysler Corp.'s
parts-making division gathered outside company headquarters
Thursday shouting ``Strike! Strike!.'' ``You do whatever you need
to do _ and you know what to do,'' United Auto Workers union Vice
President Marc Stepp told more than 1,000 workers who marched in
windy, 20-degree weather for more than two hours.
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca has said Chrysler is considering
selling its 28,000-worker, $1 billion Acustar Inc. parts-making
subsidiary and may announce a decision next month.
   The union is trying to pressure Chrysler into retreating from
the sale, which Stepp said threatens the job security of all
Chrysler workers and is further damaging Chrysler's already injured
labor relations.
   Besides potential strikes over local issues at key plants that
could shut Chrysler down, local leaders said they will stop
cooperating in programs aimed at improving quality and efficiency.
   Chrysler spokesman Doug Nicoll said Chrysler had no immediate
comment.
   Acustar, which has plants in Mexico and Canada as well as the
United States, represents nearly a fifth of Chrysler's worldwide
operations, already the leanest among the Big Three U.S. automakers.
   Chrysler has said it may sell Acustar because it doesn't want to
invest in the research needed to upgrade some operations. Chrysler
already buys 70 percent of its parts elsewhere.
   Before the demonstration, Stepp met in Detroit with the
140-member Chrysler national bargaining council, which represents
all of Chrysler's 49 UAW locals, and about 100 others who came to
listen.
   The union cannot legally call a national strike over the sale of
Acustar. But Stepp said he told the council he will authorize
locals to strike on a plant-by-plant basis over unresolved issues
such as health and safety grievances.
   At least seven Chrysler locals already have voted to ask for
authorization and one, at Chrysler's key 4,000-worker stamping
plant in Sterling Heights, will receive permission as early as next
week, Stepp said.
   Other locals are gathering grievances and preparing to take
strike votes and seek national authorization. If disputes aren't
resolved, local unions may strike seven days after they receive
authorization.
   The council unanimously passed a resolution calling for
suspension of all joint labor-management programs, including
special team-concept agreements at six plants, that require trust
and cooperation.
   Workers say they are angry at the possible sale because they
made concessions and helped Iacocca win loan guarantees from the
federal government to rescue the company from the verge of
bankruptcy eight years ago.
   ``Let this be a lesson to all America, to trade unionists
everywhere, if you think you can work out some cooperative programs
to generate trust with this corporation, forget it, because you
can't,'' Stepp told the protesters.

   Gillette Co. urged its stockholders Thursday to
resist an attempt by Coniston Partners to seize four seats on
Gillette's board of directors.
   Coniston wants Gillette to boost the value of its stock, by
selling itself to another company, or selling off its assets
piecemeal or restructuring its finances. Gillette Chairman Colman
M. Mockler Jr. asked stockholders not to sign proxy cards being
distributed by Coniston, which controls a roughly 6 percent stake
in the consumer products maker.
   ``The board of directors believes the stated intentions and
suggestions of this group are not in the best interests of your
company and intends to oppose the group's actions vigorously,'' a
letter from Mockler to stockholders said.
   Coniston, a New York investment partnership, announced earlier
this month that it was approaching potential buyers of the
Boston-based company and might take other moves to boost Gillette's
share price.
   The firm last week nominated four candidates for the seats on
the 12-member board of directors up for election at Gillette's
annual meeting April 21. Stockholders as of March 7 will be
eligible to take part in the board vote.
   ``This letter is essentially a stop, look and listen letter,''
Gillette spokesman Dick Gauthier said.
   Gillette stock fell $1.37{ a share to $39.87{ Thursday in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Analysts believe Gillette's recent stock price is well below the
high-$40 to low-$50 range estimated as its acquisition value. The
company late last year rejected a $47-a-share, $5.4 billion buyout
offer from Revlon Group Inc., which has bid for Gillette since 1986.
   The company reported a 12 percent rise in sales and doubling in
operating profits last year.
   Gus Oliver, a general partner in Coniston, said Thursday the
company stood by its position that the proxy fight was necessary
because Gillette's takeover defenses meant the board had power to
accept or reject any merger offers.
   He criticized Mockler's letter but said: ``I think it's to be
expected from this particular management and board of directors.''
   The letter said Gillette would ``act vigorously'' to resist
attempts by Coniston to gain a greater stake in the independent
company, known for its personal products such as razor blades and
pens.
   ``The board regrets that a costly proxy contest for the control
of the direction of your company may develop, particularly at the
time when the company is starting to realize many of the ongoing
benefits of its restructuring activity,'' the letter said.
   Coniston sucessfully waged a similar strategy of ``strategic
block investing'' last year that led to the break-up of Allegis
Corp.
   ``Your board of directors believes that this is but a catch
phrase for trying to force the sale or dismemberment of companies
in which Coniston takes positions,'' Mockler said.
   ``From what little is publicly known about Coniston Partners,
neither it nor its partners have any direct experience in managing
or running an international consumer products firm.''
   Gillette reported net income of $229.9 million on sales of $3.17
billion for 1987 compared with net income of $15.8 million on sales
of $2.82 billion in 1986. The 1986 figures included a special
charge of $165.3 million.
   Excluding the charge, Gillette reported earnings per share of $2
last year compared with $1.42 in 1986.

warned the Reagan administration that further attempts to pressure
the central bank to lower interest rates could boomerang.
   Greenspan's warning came Wednesday as the administration sought
to dampen its dispute with the Fed. Beryl Sprinkel, the president's
chief economic adviser, said the administration is ``delighted with
monetary policy.''
   At issue is a critical letter sent by Assistant Treasury
Secretary Michael Darby to top Fed policy-makers 10 days before
they were to meet to set 1988 monetary growth targets.

   The nation's record trade deficit shrank in
the final quarter of 1987 as U.S. exports climbed 6 percent to
record levels, the Commerce Department says.
   While narrowing just $200 million from the summer, the deficit's
decline to $40.2 billion on a balance-of-payments basis marked the
first quarterly improvement since the spring of 1986, the
department said Wednesday.
   Robert Ortner, undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs,
said further improvements were likely.

   Sales of domestically made cars and light trucks
jumped 14.5 percent in mid-February from a year earlier despite
cold weather that could have kept some buyers out of showrooms,
automakers said.
   Total domestic car sales rose 11.9 percent in the nine selling
days from Feb. 11-20, while domestic truck sales jumped 19.6
percent, the automakers reported Wednesday.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. reported
healthy increases in sales, which were not shared by most
foreign-based automakers.

   General Motors Corp. has boosted 1988 production
plans by 175,000 cars and trucks and will recall 8,600 laid-off
workers and reopen a temporarily closed assembly plant.
   ``The strengthening demand for GM vehicles reflects the ongoing
product quality improvements resulting from plant modernization and
employee involvement programs,'' GM President Robert Stempel stated
Wednesday.
   GM will increase production by running some plants, particularly
for trucks, on overtime; restoring second shifts at two U.S. plants
and one in Canada; and reopening its closed Framingham, Mass.,
assembly plant.

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. has rejected
Henley Group Inc.'s latest offer to buy a controlling interest in
the company.
   Santa Fe said Wednesday that the proposal would give Henley an
effective controlling stake in the company without having to pay a
premium to other shareholders.
   Henley, which holds a 15.7 percent stake in Santa Fe, offered
Monday to buy 44.6 million new shares for $780 million if the
Chicago company would abandon its ``poison pill'' takeover defense
and restructure a $4.7 billion special dividend to stockholders.

   Dart Group Corp. says it will continue a $1.03
billion hostile takeover bid for Stop & Shop Cos. Inc., which is
negotiating with several other potential buyers.
   Stop & Shop confirmed Wednesday it had begun talks with several
parties considering a buyout of the supermarket and discount store
chain, raising the possibility it might find a ``white knight''
friendly suitor to thwart Dart.
   Sandy Bouzoukis, a Stop & Shop spokeswoman, declined to name the
parties interested.

<HEAD>FCC Extends Rate of Return on AT&T's Interstate Operations</HEAD>

   The Federal Communications Commission on
Thursday voted to extend through 1989 American Telephone &
Telegraph Co.'s 12.2 percent authorized rate of return on its
regulated interstate operations.
   The FCC also decided to extend the 12 percent rate of return
that local telephone companies can earn on the payments they
receive from long-distance companies for providing access to the
local networks.
   The FCC had set those rates in August 1986 to cover the calendar
years 1987 and 1988. The commission voted 3-0 to extend the rates
for a third year because economic conditions are about the same
today as they were when the rates were set two years ago.
   FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick said the extension would also add
stability to phone rates and give the commission more time to
refine the formula for determining appropriate rates of return.
   Gerald Brock, the FCC's top telephone staff official, said the
action has ``no direct effect'' on the commission's proposal to
replace rate-of-return regulation of AT&T and the local Bell phone
companies with a cap on the rates they can charge.
   The agency proposed a broad rate-cap plan last August and, under
pressure from Congress, said recently it will propose a more
specific plan, probably this spring.
   Under the current form of regulation, the FCC sets the profit
level it will allow for phone companies under its jurisdiction and
allows that target to be met over a period of time.
   A federal appeals court earlier this year struck down the FCC's
rules for ordering refunds by companies that exceed their
authorized rate of return because the rules didn't permit companies
that earn less than the allowed rate to recoup any shortfalls.
   The court invited the agency to fashion a new refund policy, but
the FCC has not yet responded.
