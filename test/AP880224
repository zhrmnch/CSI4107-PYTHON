   Texaco Inc. has agreed to pay $1.25 billion to
the government to settle claims it overcharged customers for oil
during the 1973-81 period of price controls.
   The nation's third largest oil company said Tuesday it would
make a first installment of $400 million when the agreement was
closed and pay the rest over the following 5{ years.
   The White Plains, N.Y.-based oil giant is the latest in a series

   A federal judge has ruled Occidental
Chemical Corp. is liable for the estimated $250 million cost of
cleaning up the Love Canal landfill that became synonymous with
environmental disaster.
   After nine years of deliberations, U.S. District Judge John
Curtin said Tuesday that Occidental produced the wastes that
created the disaster and stored them in a way that would eventually
result in toxic leakage.
   Occidental spokesman James Green said the company was
disappointed by the ruling but would not comment until its
attorneys had studied the decision.

<HEAD>Police Officers Guilty in Queens Stun Gun Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former police sergeant and a suspended officer
were convicted Wednesday of torturing a drug suspect with an
electric stun gun three years ago.
   In addition, a former officer was convicted of beating of the
man at his home, and a suspended lieutenant was found guilty of
abetting the beating.
   The defendants were among several police officers from the same
Queens precinct implicated in 1985 in the alleged torture of drug
suspects with the stun gun, which delivers a powerful, temporarily
disabling jolt of up to 40,000 volts.
   Everton Evelyn had testified that four officers beat him in his
home in 1985, and that two of them had later used a stun gun on him
at the station, holding him down and giving him shocks from the
hand-held device.
   The 34-year-old taxi driver testified that the stun gun was used
on his abdomen seven to 10 times for five seconds at a time. He has
also filed a $50 million lawsuit against the city and the Police
Department.
   Former Sgt. Richard Pike and suspended Officer Loren MacCary
were convicted of assault, official misconduct and coercion and
could receive up to seven years in prison.
   Jeffrey Gilbert, a former officer, was convicted of the same
charges in the beating. Suspended Lt. Steven Cheswick, who
supervised the other three, was convicted of official misconduct
and faces up to a year in jail.
   The jury had begun deliberating Monday afternoon.
   Pike was found guilty in both the beating and the stun gun
attack; MacCary was convicted in the stun gun attack; and Gilbert
was found guilty in the beating.
   Cheswick, prosecutors said, had blocked Evelyn's wife from
aiding her husband during the beating and had not tried to stop the
beating.
   The four defendants will be sentenced March 29.
   The trial was the second of four scheduled for officers of the
106th precinct who allegedly tortured suspects with stun guns in
1985. Pike and Gilbert already are serving two to six years for
their convictions in the first trial, in 1986.

   A suitcase reportedly containing
$30,000 has been recovered from a plane that crashed in the woods
here, killing three people, authorities said.
   The suitcase of Simon Siegel, 66, of Brookline, Mass., was found
Saturday, said police Lt. Frank Lentz.
   He would not discuss the contents, saying only that it contained
personal belongings. The Press of Atlantic City on Tuesday quoted
sources as saying it contained $30,000.
   Siegel, owner of Siegel's Egg Company in Roxbury, Mass., was
flying to an Atlantic City casino Friday when the plane crashed,
killing him, the pilot and co-pilot.
   The Siegel family attorney is expected to arrive later this week
to reclaim the bag, Lentz said.

<HEAD>Senate Filibuster Over Campaign Spending Limits Bill</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS 2 grafs after 2nd graf pvs, bgng: ``The talking ...''
to UPDATE with motion to arrest absent senators.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOELLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate launched a ``full-fledged
filibuster'' Tuesday as Majority Leader Robert Byrd ordered 24-hour
sessions to subdue Republican opposition to a Democratic campaign
financing bill.
   The talking, broken by occasional roll calls, began about 2 p.m.
and continued into the night. Appointments were canceled, schedules
revised, senators began catching up on paperwork and cots were set
up in rooms near the chamber.
   Shortly after 11 p.m., the Democrats used their numbers to
approve a rarely-used motion ordering the sergeant-at-arms to take
to the streets to arrest senators who had been absent from a series
of quorum calls.
   Democrats said the move was made because Republicans were taking
turns holding the floor, forcing Democrats to stay close by the
chamber to prevent the loss of a quorum, which would immediately
end the session.
   Byrd, lacking the votes to prevent Republicans from stalling
action on the legislation, threatened to keep the Senate in session
indefinitely.
   ``We've decided we'll just go around-the-clock,'' the West
Virginia Democrat said at midafternoon after Republican and
Democratic negotiators reported making no progress on the central
question of spending limits.
   ``We're going to talk or we're going to vote,'' said Byrd,
warning that foes of the campaign finance legislation would have to
keep control of the floor to prevent a vote.
   Democrats and Republicans have been at loggerheads for nearly a
year over a Democratic bill with 52 co-sponsors that would set up a
system of voluntary spending limits for Senate general election
campaigns.
   The limit would be from $950,000 to $5.5 million, depending on a
state's population. The bill's supporters say limits are needed to
put a brake on the increasing cost of getting elected, up from an
average of $600,000 in 1976 to $3 million in 1986.
   In larger states, growing numbers of candidates are spending
more than $10 million to win a Senate seat, with increasing amounts
of campaign funds being supplied by special-interest political
action committees.
   A candidate observing the voluntary limit would get campaign
funds from the Treasury if the opponent exceeded the limit or an
independent group spent large amounts of money against the
candidate.
   Republicans, who have made opposition to limits a party issue,
succeeded last year in preventing the Senate from voting on the
legislation, winning a record seven cloture votes during 22 days of
floor time.
   Byrd, even with the support of three of the Senate's 46
Republicans, is believed to be five votes short of the 60 needed to
cut off debate and force a vote on the bill.
   ``The Senate is in a full-fledged filibuster,'' said Byrd,
adding that he would no longer confine debate to daylight hours.
   ``There's no point in continuing the casual, gentlemanly,
good-guy filibuster because it will just turn out like it did last
year,'' he said. ... Let's have it on the floor where the American
people can see it.''
   Four Democrats and four Republicans have been negotiating since
last week. They reported progress on some facets of the bill but
not on spending limits, which Republicans say will discriminate
against them in states with a heavy Democratic edge in registered
votes.
   The chief negotiators said their positions on the key issue were
solid.
   A limit on spending ``is something this side is not going to
agree to,'' said Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. ``That is not one of the
negotiable items.''
   His counterpart, David Boren, D-Okla., was just as adamant:
``Any bill that does not limit campaign spending would not be real
reform.''
   Boren said, however, that Democrats are willing to discuss
higher spending limits in states where their party enjoys a big
advantage in registration or historically has dominated
congressional elections.
   There was no public response from McConnell, who said
Republicans were willing to discuss compromise on another
Democratic demand: putting a ceiling on how much money a candidate
can get from political action committees.
   Boren and McConnell said negotiators had neared informal
agreement on other issues, including controling how much personal
money a millionare can put into his or her campaign; requiring
broadcasters to charge rock-bottom rates for political ads; better
disclosure of money going to political parties; and getting
controls on so-called ``soft money,'' which includes groups like
labor unions supplying people to help candidates with canvassing
and phone banks.

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   India is taking the bullock-cart into
the 21st century.
   At least 500 researchers in about a dozen government-aided
institutes are at work modernizing the ancient, creaking, plodding
carts, and even the World Bank has donated funds. Carts of various
shapes and designs, made of plastic and aluminum, are being tested
or have been developed.
   ``There is nothing funny about our project,'' said Mittar Pal
Dhir, director of the Road Research Institute in New Delhi. ``For
us, animal-drawn carts are of great importance.''
   India has an estimated 13 million bullock carts drawn by about
26 million of the neutered bulls, along with 2 million carts pulled
by water buffaloes, camels, horses, mules and donkeys.
   The carts are seen most often in villages, where about 640
million of the India's 800 million people live.
   But they also are seen on major highways and an estimated 3
million plod along city streets, often slowing engine-powered
traffic and infuriating motorists.
   Bullock carts have even been used to pull MiG fighter jets to
parades and earth satellites to launching pads.
   Dhir said it would be 50 years before India could eliminate
animal-drawn carts, given their crucial role in Indian life.
   Capital investment in animal-drawn carts is put at $7.6 billion.
   More than 20 million Indians earn their living by driving,
renting, and repairing the carts.
   ``The figure is striking given the fact that Indian railways,
the fourth largest in the world, employ only 16.3 million people,''
said Rupinder Gupta, a mechanical engineer for the Road Research
Institute. Gupta has designed six types of bullock cart for field
trials.
   Each year, animal-drawn carts move 14.4 million ton-miles of
freight.
   Dhir estimates that India's animal-drawn carts provide about 40
million horse-power, equal to about 320,000 medium-duty trucks used
in the United States as city delivery vehicles.
   Without bullock carts, India also would have had to import an
additional 6 million tons of fuel each year. It now imports 17
million tons of crude oil annually.
   One of the innovations is the replacement of the carts'
wooden-spoke wheels with pneumatic tires.
   Engineer Gupta said carts with pneumatic tires can pull 2.5 tons
of weight against the maximum capacity of 1.5 tons for conventional
carts.
   Researchers in the southern state of Karnataka also have come up
with plastic bullock carts, and in neighboring Andhra Pradesh state
a tire company has produced carts of lightweight aluminum.
   Another idea behind non-wooden carts is to reduce demand for
lumber. An estimated 165,000 medium-sized trees are felled each
year to make conventional carts.
   ``So you see, there is a solid logic behind metal carts,'' said
Gupta.
   He listed other reasons for updating the carts.
   ``We want to increase tillage and output, reduce damage to roads
and injury to animals so that the poor animals can have a longer
lifespan,'' he said.
   To protect the animals, curved and padded yokes are being
introduced. Studies have shown that some draft animals' lives are
cut short by cancerous infections on the neck from unpadded and
uncurved yokes.
   Reflectors are being added as another safety feature.
   Other new fittings are bush bearings, cast-iron springs, shock
absorbers, draw bars that adjust for animals of different height,
and mud scrappers.
   A fodder box can be put on carts that go long distances.
   As for road damage, director Dhir said the biggest culprit is
wooden wheels.
   ``In monetary terms the annual damage is to the tune of 7,000
million rupees ($538 million) to the roads,'' he said.
   Farmers seem to like the idea of improving bullock carts.
   ``It is an excellent idea,'' said Jhandu Singh, 64, of Jharsa, a
village 30 miles south of New Delhi.
   ``But this should have had been done 25 years ago. We have
suffered for long, and so did the animals.''
   Officials, too, say the new carts are catching on, but this
itself is creating problems.
   ``We do not have enough new types of carts for all,'' said Kalle
Khan, project economist of the District Rural Development Agency in
Jharsa, whose office received only 16 new carts.
   ``There are more than 200 claimants. Even some gypsies saw the
carts and were attracted. They wanted at least one. I told them no.
These are for farmers.''
   Another reason for high demand is that the government is
subsidizing the price by about 35 percent.
   It is estimated that the largest of the old wooden carts costs
the equivalent of about $300. Newer wooden carts, without the
government subsidy, cost $270 to $460. The plastic and aluminum
carts are 25 percent more expensive.

<DATELINE>YENAN, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The town that was Mao Tse-tung's civil war
haven in remote northwest China is struggling to catch up with a
revolution that left it behind when the Communist Party leadership
marched out 40 years ago to triumph.
   The caves Mao called home in Yenan's arid mountains are
preserved much as he left them, the spartan desks and bedstands
still in place.
   Since then, Yenan's population has grown from 10,000 to 80,000,
and a smattering of eight- and 10-story concrete apartment blocks
give the town an urban air. But the lives of most of its residents
have changed little compared with the rest of China.
   Two-thirds of Yenan's people still live in caves in the steep
brown cliffs overlooking two narrow rivers that meet at Yenan.
   The cave-dwellers fetch water from nearby wells and grind their
grain using old-style millstones turned by donkey or by hand. They
cook on coal stoves that also heat the family sleeping platform,
the kang.
   The caves have electricity, but few people have major electrical
appliances.
   The average annual per capita income of Yenan's peasants is $59
_ less than half the national average and barely above the official
poverty level of $54. Non-peasants average $108 a year, compared
with a national figure of $248.
   The Communist revolution was intended to free the peasants from
the whims of nature and those in power. But in Yenan, nature has
been stingy and those in power are far away.
   ``We rely on heaven for food,'' said Lei Zhifu, a former
guerrilla leader and retired Communist Party official, quoting an
ancient saying about China's dependence on nature.
   Mao, who arrived here in 1937 at the end of the Long March, a
6,000-mile retreat from Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist troops, left
Yenan in 1947 as the country's civil war raged. He never returned.
   Premier Chou En-lai returned briefly in 1973, to attend the
opening of a revolutionary museum. He ordered that small factories
be set up with central government help to supplement the
perennially drought-stricken area's meager agricultural income.
   The factories were built: fertilizer, steel, cement and textiles
among others. But nothing was done to ensure that their products
reached markets.
   Only one narrow, twisting road and three weekly flights link
Yenan to the outside world. The nearest big city, Xian, is more
than 185 miles to the south, an eight-hour trip by car.
   Since 1985, Beijing has moved to end Yenan's isolation by
providing more than $54 million toward construction of a railroad.
Tracks have been laid nearly halfway from Xian to Yenan, and plans
are to finish by 1990.
   There's a snag _ $43 million more is needed to build the final
stretch. Li Guanhua, deputy director of Yenan's planning
commission, said he expected Beijing to provide at least part.
   Even with a railroad, Li's plans for Yenan's future are modest.
He envisioned gradual growth fueled by wider sales for the town's
factories, especially its leading industry, cigarettes.
   Lu Derong, the cigarette factory's deputy director, said they'll
double production to 64 million packs a year once the railroad is
finished.
   The workers earn an average of $405 a year, making them the best
paid in town.
   But the railroad is unlikely to help the 200-employee match
factory next door, already hard hit by competition from larger,
mechanized factories elsewhere.
   It shut down for 10 months last year because it had no money to
buy wood for matches. Yenan officials finally loaned it $27,000 _
enough to reopen but not to buy modern machinery that would make it
competitive.
   Elsewhere in China, state-owned factories that lose money are
being closed or leased to entrepreneurs under top leader Deng
Xiaoping's decade-old program to stimulate the economy and reduce
central controls.
   But Li said ``no one in Yenan has enough money'' to lease the
match factory. And it can't be shut, officials said, because the
workers need the jobs.
   Yenan's agriculture also needs massive investment, in the form
of irrigation canals, to significantly raise production. With less
than 16 inches of rain annually, yields are less than half those in
China's lush southeast.
   No efforts are made to encourage the one industry for which
Yenan is historically equipped: tourism. More than 50 hotels are
under construction in Xian alone as part of a nationwide tourism
boom, but Yenan offers only five small guest houses.
   Xian, site of the ancient city of Chang-an, is known for its
temples and tombs. Its biggest attraction is the thousands of
life-size terra cotta warriors built more than 2,000 years ago to
guard the tomb of Emperor Qin Shi Huangdi, who united China.
   Of the 80,000 visitors to Mao's old headquarters every year,
only about 500 are foreigners, who bring far more money than
Chinese.
   Yenan's dust-covered streets are uninviting and things are
sleepy.
   Even a confirmed Marxist like Lei Zhifu said he attends
ceremonies at the local Buddhist temple ``for excitement.''

   Actor-comedian Steve Martin had a
question as soon as he received the Hasty Pudding Club Man of the
Year award at Harvard University: ``There is a cash prize for this,
right?''
   Appearing Tuesday in a rumpled, oversize tuxedo and rubber-soled
suede shoes without laces, Martin delighted the audience of nearly
200 when he leaped like a game-show contestant, shouting, ``I won,
I won.''
   He received a brass pudding pot, but no cash.
   The nation's oldest undergraduate theatrical organization gave
its annual award to Martin for ``his lasting and impressive
contribution to the world of entertainment,'' said program
co-producer Andrea Campbell.
   Martin said receiving the award made up for his movie
``Roxanne'' not being nominated for an Oscar this year.
   ``Yes it does, because it's such a prestigious award, and so few
people have gotten one,'' he said.
   Martin's first two comedy albums won Grammy awards and he has
written and co-starred in such box-office hits as ``The Jerk'' and
``Pennies from Heaven.''
   The Hasty Pudding Club awarded Lucille Ball its Woman of the
Year award last week.

<HEAD>With Jails Crowded, Judges Look For Sentences To Fit The Crime</HEAD>

   A judge in Oregon makes some convicts buy newspaper ads to
apologize. Slumlords in California and New York are sentenced to
live in their own buildings. In New Jersey, executives convicted of
securities violations are ordered to read up on ethics, and write
reports.
   Such innovations are sometimes motivated by overflowing jails,
but in other cases are intended to tailor the punishment to the
crime.
   On Tuesday, for instance, Circuit Judge Stuart Nudelman in
Chicago sentenced a white man convicted of threatening blacks to do
200 hours of community service with the National Assocaition for
the Advancement of Colored People.
   ``He's going to learn how to be a responsible human being,''
Nudelman said in sentencing James Kalafut, 22, who was part of a
group of whites and Hispanics who menaced two blacks with baseball
bats and bottles last year.
   Last month, Anne Arundel County in Maryland joined a growing
number of jurisdictions that are using electronic gadgets to
enforce non-jail sentences. The county's program for repeat drunken
driving offenders calls for them to continue working, but turn over
one-fourth of their pay to the county and spend their free time
exclusively at home.
   To make sure they do, television cameras are installed in the
homes, and a jailer calls at random times to make sure the subject
is at home.
   ``There simply isn't enough room in the detention center to lock
everyone up,'' explains District Judge Thomas J. Curley, who
envisions expanding the program to include those convicted of drug
abuse, petty thievery or battery.
   ``The obvious selling point is the cost,'' said Richard Grinter,
president of Program Monitor Inc. The Dallas-based firm contracts
with government agencies to operate monitoring systems, and charges
$7 per case per day.
   Program Monitor has only 45 cases in Texas now and isn't making
money, Grinter said Tuesday, but he said a state commission
estimated in 1986 that as many as 6,000 prisoners might be suitable
for electronic monitoring.
   Program Monitor provided the hardware to monitor a New York
landlord, Morris Gross, who was convicted of multiple building
violations and sentenced to live in one of his buildings in
Brooklyn. He was released last week after spending eight days in
his newly plastered and painted apartment in the rundown building.
   A similar sentence was imposed last year on Dr. Milton Avol, a
Beverly Hills neurosurgeon convicted of numerous violations in
buildings he owned.
   In other recent cases:
   _ Multimillionaire industrialist Victor Posner, who pleaded no
contest to evading more than $1.2 million in federal taxes, was
sentenced on Feb. 12 to work 5,000 hours of community service over
the next five years.
   U.S. District Judge Eugene Spellman also ordered the 69-year-old
financier to pay $4 million in back taxes and penalties, and
contribute $3 million to programs for the homeless. The maximum
sentence for the conviction was in excess of 40 years in prison.
   ``At your age, I doubt you'd be in jail more than six to nine
months regardless of the sentence,'' Spellman said.
   _ A city judge in Charleston, W.Va., ordered a man convicted of
destroying a newspaper vending box to spend the next month guarding
its replacement. Christopher A. Jones, 25, was sentenced to stand
watch from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. for 30 days.
   _ Last September, U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise in
Newark, N.J., sentenced four former executives of a collapsed
securities brokerage to read six books about suffering and
afflicted people and submit reports after serving prison terms of
up to 2{ years.
   The executives had pleaded guilty to charges in connection with
the collapse of Bevill, Bresler & Schulman Inc. They testified
against a fifth executive, who was convicted and sentenced to eight
years in prison.
   Among the assigned books were John Steinbeck's ``The Grapes of
Wrath,'' biographies of George Washington and Martin Luther King,
and ``Working Your Way to the Botton _ The Feminization of
Poverty.''
   _ In Lincoln County, Ore., District Attorney Ulys Stapleton
began a program two years ago requiring convicts to apologize for
their crimes in community newspapers. One of the first ads was
placed by a former sheriff's detective convicted of possessing a
controlled substance.
   Sometimes the experiments don't pan out.
   District Judge Dorothy Baker in Portland, Ore., gained national
attention when she sentenced child molester Richard J. Bateman to
post signs on his house and car warning, ``Dangerous Sex Offender.
No Children Allowed.''
   Bateman, 47, later dropped out of sight for three weeks, was
rearrested and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   Georgia won an ``innovation in government'' award from the Ford
Foundation last year in recognition of its comprehensive program to
provide alternatives to jail time.
   The state has about 18,500 prison inmates, but 109,000 other
convicts have been placed in programs ranging from basic probation
to boot camp-style life in a diversion center, to 90-day ``shock
incarceration'' for offenders aged 17 to 25.
   Shock incarceration is intended convince violators who haven't
been in prison before that they don't want to come back. A study in
1986 found that 23 percent of those who went through shock
incarceration committed further crimes, compared to 22 percent for
the general prison population, said Larry Anderson, coordinator of
the state's diversion programs.
   ``At first blush you are prone to say there is no appreciable
difference,'' Anderson said Tuesday, ``but the other way of looking
at it is that we can give someone a 90-day prison experience, as
opposed to an experience that may last for years, and do no worse.''
   In other words, the state gets the same results for less money.
   In the diversion centers, where the state can accommodate up to
750 people, prisoners work during the day, and pay $6.50 a day for
board and room. Thus, the state's cost is $27.50 a day, compared to
$37 day for each prison inamte, Anderson said.
   The state also has an intenive probation program, in which
probationers have to meet four times a week with an officer. That
program is self-supporting, because judges may impose fees up to
$50 a month as part of the sentence, Anderson said.
   In 1982, Anderson said, 63 percent of criminal convicts in
Georgia received a probated sentence. In 1985, that had increased
to 73 percent.
   ``If you look at 1981, the state of Georgia had the highest
per-capita incarceration rate in the United States. It exceeded the
incarceration rate of the Soviet Union and the Union of South
Africa,'' he said.
   ``We began putting our emphasis on alternative programs in 1982,
and by 1985 we had dropped down to No. 11 in per-capita
incarceration rates.''
   ``The real issue now,'' he emphasized, ``is that we cannot
afford to build any more prisons.''

   Two men were dead; valuable manuscripts had
changed hands; false names were involved.
   The mystery was solved Tuesday as Columbia University announced
that it had been given the papers of Ellery Queen, the dashing,
upper-crust detective whose adventures helped elevate American
detective fiction to an art form.
   Ellery Queen was created by Brooklyn-born cousins Frederic
Dannay and Manfred B. Lee, who entered a 1928 mystery contest that
required a pseudonym.
   They invented Queen and made him both author and protagonist,
thinking an author would be better remembered if his name appeared
throughout the book.
   More than 40 Ellery Queen novels were written before Lee died in
1971. His partner, Dannay, died in 1982, and Dannay's sons Richard
and Douglas gave the Ellery Queen papers to Columbia.
   The manuscripts show that Lee and Dannay often were at odds over
their work, with intense disagreements and personality clashes.
There are extensive revisions; in one case, 50 pages were deleted
from a novel.
   ``We're not so much collaborators as competitors. It has
produced a sharper edge,'' Dannay once said.
   The 25,000-item collection includes the only surviving
manuscript of the first Ellery Queen novel, ``The Roman Hat
Mystery,'' and the notes, outlines and corrected manuscripts of the
last, ``A Fine and Private Place.''
   Also included are letters and manuscripts of Dashiell Hammett,
Cornell Woolrich, John Dickson Carr, Agatha Christie and others
whose work already can be found in Columbia's archive of mystery
and detective writing.
   The Ellery Queen novels led to a series of movies, radio and
television shows, and to Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine, which
first appeared in 1941 and is still published monthly.
   The Ellery Queen archives include the first issue of the
magazine, along with manuscripts from such contributors as William
Faulkner.
   Selections from the archives will be on exhibit at Columbia's
Butler Library from March 3 to July 6.

   Repeat drunken drivers convicted in a new
program are being allowed to keep their jobs, but as soon as the
whistle blows they must go home, stay home and stay sober. Big
brother will be watching, and calling.
   Anne Arundel County has invested $15,000 in 30 video monitoring
systems, which are installed in offenders' homes and linked by
telephone lines to a master control in the county jail.
   Under the program launched Jan. 26, offenders are not watched
all the time, but they never know when a jail officer will call and
ask them to step before the camera.
   ``A lot of people say I got off easy, but you're stopped in your
tracks at the front door,'' said one of the first four men
sentenced under the program, a three-time offender who agreed to be
interviewed on condition his name not be used. ``It's not exactly a
slap on the wrist, but it's better than sitting in jail.''
   For this offender, the hardest part of the program is turning
over $336 a month _ one-fourth of his salary _ to the county during
his 90-day sentence. ``It's a big dent in our pocket,'' said his
wife.
   An operator at the the jail dials each offender once, and often
twice, a night and instructs him to turn on the video equipment and
stand in front of the camera.
   The county also has purchased hand-held breath analyzers to make
sure the offender is complying with a judge's no-drinking
stipulation. The equipment displays alcohol levels in bright red
numerals that can be read over the TV monitor.
   House detainees also are required to turn over one-quarter of
their take-home pay to the county. If an offender's home doesn't
have an adequate telephone jack, he has to pay for one.
   Violation of any condition brings a jail sentence.
   John Sellers, government marketing coordinator for Mitsubishi
Electric, said the VisiTel system has been used in several states
to monitor probationers, but he said Anne Arundel County is
apparently the first to use the system as an alternative to prison
sentences.
   At least 11 manufacturers are marketing systems, according to
the National Institute of Justice.
   The program has been endorsed by the local chapter of Mothers
Against Drunk Driving. Jean Heald, president of the group, said
that when the program is combined with an alcohol counseling
program it may help make highways safer.
   ``We're hopeful. Sending them to jail we know doesn't work,''
said Ms. Heald, who said the program is in keeping with a
philosophy of ``punishment for the crime, treatment for the disease
and monitoring for the citizen.''
   County officials plan to review the program in the next few
weeks and decide whether to buy 90 additional monitors this smmer.
   District Judge Thomas J. Curley drug users, petty thieves and
those convicted of minor battery charges are also likely candidates
for house detention.
   Asked if he expects public opposition, Curley was frank: ``Are
you kidding? Nothing is ever tough enough for them. But I have to
live in the real world.''
   House detention is an alternative to paying up to $40 a day to
keep a prisoner in the county jail, as well as putting off the cost
of constructing new prisons.
   ``There simply isn't enough room in the detention center to lock
everyone up,'' said Curley.
   Electronically enforced home-detention programs have expanded
rapidly since the first reported test in Albuquerque, N.M., in 1983.
   As of last February, according to the National Institute of
Justice, an arm of the U.S. Justice Department, 53 house-detention
programs in 21 states electronically monitored more than 800
offenders. Most programs rely on electronic bracelets that signal
when an offender has strayed from home.
   The institute reported that offenders in such programs tended to
be males under the age of 30. About one-third were convicted of
serious traffic violations, particularly drunken driving. Another
large category included parolees and probationers.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
on Tuesday denounced as ``complete nonsense'' a memo that described
plans to funnel millions of dollars to his Labor Party for
assurances that Israel would not bomb a proposed Iraqi pipeline.
   The 1985 memo, made public Monday, was addressed to U.S.
Attorney General Edwin Meese III and written by E. Robert Wallach,
a longtime Meese friend and lawyer for Swiss oilman Bruce
Rappaport, a partner in the pipeline project.
   The $1 billion pipeline was to have carried oil from Iraq
through Jordan to the Gulf of Aqaba, but was never built.
   Israeli officials ``all agreed that we favored the laying of the
pipeline. So why would anyone need to use bribes?'' Peres told
reporters during a tour of the occupied West Bank's largest city.
``I don't understand this.''
   However, Peres through a spokesman in Jerusalem acknowledged
Tuesday that the Israeli government had been offered a discount on
oil purchases amounting to $65 million to $70 million a year in
return for approving the pipeline, The Washington Post reported in
Wednesday's editions.
   But the aide said that Peres did not take the offer seriously
and failed to pass it on to colleagues, the newspaper said. He said
the offer was made by Rappaport but there was no proposal for
paying part of the discount to Peres' party, the Post reported.
   An Israeli military analyst on Tuesday told The Associated Press
it would not have been in Israel's interest to destroy the pipeline
because Israel has sought a dialogue with Iraq to counter growing
hostility from Iran.
   The memo said Rappaport ``confirmed the arrangement with Peres
to the effect that Israel will receive somewhere between $65
million and $70 million a year for 10 years out of the conclusion
of the project.''
   ``What also was indicated to me,'' Wallach wrote to Meese, ``and
which would be denied everywhere, is that a portion of those funds
will go directly to Labor.''
   The memo is central to a criminal investigation of Meese. At
issue is whether Meese knew of a possibly improper payment plan
involving the Labor Party and, if so, why he did nothing about it.
   In a handwritten note from Peres to Meese, also made public
Monday, the Israeli leader said of the pipeline project: ``I would
go a long way to help it out. But then discretion is demanded on
our part.''
   Asked about the Wallach-Meese memo, Peres said: ``No one said he
gave the Labor Party anything or proposed anything to the Labor
Party. As far as I'm concerned, it's complete nonsense.''
   Earlier, a Foreign Ministry aide close to Peres told The
Associated Press: ``Mr. Peres did not see a penny out of this, and
neither did the Labor Party.''
   ``We repeatedly have denied the whole story,'' he said, speaking
on condition of anonymity. ``No money was offered to Mr. Peres and
if it had been, he would have thrown the man out the window.''
   Another ministry official told The AP that several Cabinet
ministers privately discussed the pipeline project, but no decision
about Israel's position was ever made.
   Dore Gold, a researcher at Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center
for Strategic Studies, said bombing the project would not have been
in Israel's interest, but Iraq probably ``sought as many assurances
as possible regarding a pipeline that would come so close to
Israeli borders.''
   Gold said Israel has sought to open a dialogue with Iraq to
counter growing hostility from Iran following that country's 1979
Islamic fundamentalist revolution.
   For example, Israel several years ago made an offer to Iraq to
reactivate a pipeline built in the 1930s from the Iraqi city Kirkuk
to the Israeli port city of Haifa. Gold said Iraq never responded
to the offer.
   But Zeev Eytan, another Jaffee Center researcher, said Israel
had good reason to oppose the Iraqi pipeline because it would have
turned the Jordanian city of Aqaba into an oil port and destroyed
the economic base of the neighboring Israeli resort Elat.
   Said Eytan: ``We need this like we need stones in the (occupied)
territories.''

<HEAD>Judge: Adventists, Others Can Cast Absentee Ballots In Saturday
Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLARKSBURG, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who observe the Sabbath on
Saturdays have the right to cast absentee ballots in elections held
on Saturdays, a federal judge ruled.
   In a case arising from West Virginia's March 5 constitutional
amendment election, U.S. District Judge William M. Kidd issued a
preliminary injunction Tuesday in favor of two Seventh-day
Adventists who had been told they could not submit absentee ballots
for the Saturday voting.
   The ruling also affects Jews, Seventh-day Baptists, and members
of other religious groups who believe that they should not
participate in any civic, business, governmental or non-essential
work on Saturdays.
   Karen and Howard Conner, school bus drivers in Barbour County,
contended that because of their religious beliefs, they were being
deprived of their right to vote on a proposed amendment that would
establish a statewide property tax for education.
   West Virginia usually holds elections on Tuesdays, but moved
this one to Saturday in hopes of boosting turnout. The election was
set after a state court ruled that the state must equalize spending
among school systems.
   The Conners were told by the secretary of state's office that
they did not qualify for absentee voting under state law. They then
filed suit in state court against Secretary of State Ken Hechler
and Barbour County Circuit Clerk Jean Green.
   The state Supreme Court earlier this month refused to hear the
case, so the Conners took it to the federal court.
   Kidd ordered Hechler to submit by Friday a plan ``outlining
measures to be taken to ensure that plaintiffs and members of this
class are permitted to vote in the forthcoming election.''

   Basketball star Earvin ``Magic'' Johnson told
1,200 teen-agers that he never should have dropped out of college
and still intends to get his degree.
   Johnson, who led the Los Angeles Lakers to four National
Basketball Association championships in his eight years with the
club, spoke to a cheering throng Monday at Westchester High School,
which has a 30 percent dropout rate.
   ``I am 40 hours short of my degree in telecommunications, but I
intend to get it,'' he said.
   ``My first year of high school, I was hoopin' good,'' recalled
Johnson of his childhood in Lansing, Mich. ``But my grades were
real low. My counselor pulled on my coattails and told me, `You are
getting Ds and Cs and Es. You won't go to college and play ball if
you don't pull 'em up.''
   There were a few gasps from the audience.
   ``If she didn't get to me I might not be standing here rapping
to you. I might be somewhere else. It's never too late to get
yourself together.''
   Asked about his future, Johnson said he hoped to play five or
six more years with the Lakers, ``then I'd like to get into my
businesses. Hopefully, I will own a building 18-20 stories high and
maybe hire a few of you.''

   Jazz pianist-composer Billy Taylor says money
spent sending American artists to festivals abroad is money well
spent.
   ``In traveling to places like a jazz festival in India, I've
seen Russia, Japan, France, Australia, sent their best,'' Taylor
said Tuesday. Other nations know about American music through
records, but ``that knowledge is flawed if they don't get some of
our very best. We have to find measures to at least be competitive
in this way.''
   Taylor was attending an announcement by the Rockefeller
Foundation, U.S. Information Agency and National Endowment for the
Arts of a fund to support the sending of U.S. artists to
international festivals and exhibitions.
   ``One of the things I find, traveling around the world, is that
I become intensely patriotic,'' said Taylor.

   Aston Martin, the U.S.-owned purveyor of expensive
sports cars, kept up its ties with the British royal family by
giving scaled-down cars to the young sons of Prince Charles and
Princess Diana.
   Company chairman and chief executive Victor Gauntlett made the
presentation Tuesday. But 5-year-old Prince William and 3-year-old
Prince Harry may have to wait a while before getting behind the
wheels. Asked if his children are ready to drive, the Prince of
Wales said, ``Gracious, no.''
   The 8.5-foot-long, 4@7-scale Aston Martins each cost about
$17,500. They are equipped with stereo radios and cassette players,
electrically powered aerials, five-speed gearboxes, leather
upholstery, headlights and turn signals.
   Aston Martin, which is controlled by the American manufacturer
Ford, said the junior cars are like the Aston Martin V-8 Volante
that Charles drives in virtually every detail. Instead of a V-8
British-built engine capable of a maximum speed of 153 mph,
however, they are powered by a Honda engine made in Japan and tuned
to reach 25 mph.

   Loyd will star in a 10-minute video to be distributed nationwide

services.
   The video will be shown at career days, placement fairs and at
recruitment dinners that have been spurred by the nationwide

   ABC has swept to victory and ratings gold
with its coverage of the Winter Olympics.
   Its Olympic telecasts for the week that ended Sunday captured
four of the top 10 place in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings and won
the week for ABC.
   ABC also moved ahead of NBC and into first place for the
February sweeps and into second place ahead of CBS for the
season-to-date. It kept its first-place position among the evening
news shows. The ``CBS Evening News,'' which had dominated that
category for the entire season until last week, finished second.
   NBC, whose eight-hour miniseries ``Noble House'' managed to win
only 16th place, was second for the week. Its highly rated comedy
shows did well, but were pushed down a few notches by the Olympics.
   ABC, which usually takes third place, won the A.C. Nielsen Co.
ratings for the week with an average of 19.4. NBC was second with
15.0 and CBS was third with 12.8. For the season-to-date, NBC now
has a 16.3 rating, ABC 13.8, CBS 13.6.
   The rating is the percentage of the nation's 88.6 million
households with televisions.
   It was only ABC's third weekly victory of the season, which
began in September. It won on Super Bowl and World Series weeks.
   Last week's top 10 shows were: ABC's Tuesday Olympics; NBC's
``The Cosby Show''; ABC's Saturday Olympics; NBC's ``A Different
World''; CBS' ``60 Minutes''; NBC's ``Cheers''; ABC's Wednesday
Olympics; CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote''; ABC's Thursday Olympics; and
NBC's ``Family Ties'' and ``ALF,'' which tied.
   ABC was ahead in this month's Nielsen and Arbitron sweeps
ratings. The sweeps are periods during which the ratings of the
nation's television stations are measured.
   The Fox Broadcasting Co., which has fewer stations than the
three other commercial networks, also got good news. Its ``21 Jump
Street'' had its highest rating to date with 6.6, placing it ahead
of the three lowest-rated network shows. ``Married With Children''
got a 5.7 rating, its highest ever, coming in higher than the two
bottom network shows. ``Werewolf'' got its highest rating ever in
its 8 p.m. time period, 5.1, which would give it a tie with the
networks' lowest-rated show.

   FBI agents illegally interrogated a suspected
Lebanese terrorist about a 1985 airplane hijacking when they kept
him aboard a Navy ship four days after his arrest in the
Mediterranean, a federal judge says.
   Sharply critical of the FBI's arrest and interrogation of Fawaz
Younis, U.S. District Judge Barrington D. Parker on Tuesday ruled
that oral and written confessions were obtained illegally from the
defendant.
   The judge suppressed the statements as evidence against Younis,
who is charged with leading five armed men who hijacked a Royal
Jordanian airliner on June 11, 1985, at Beirut International
Airport. The trial is scheduled to begin March 22 before Parker.
   The operation occurred after former FBI Director William H.
Webster had moved on to head the CIA and before William Sessions,
the bureau's current head, took office last fall.
   Defense lawyer Francis D. Carter said he was pleased with the
decision but conceded it won't necessarily help Younis' case.
Prosecutors have a variety of other evidence, including a videotape
of Younis delivering a statement to reporters before the plane was
blown up in the background.
   Oliver Revell, the bureau's executive assistant director,
participated in the arrest of Younis last Sept. 13 in waters off
Cyprus.
   Parker concluded that fractures Younis suffered on both wrists
were sustained when he was grabbed by two agents and slammed onto
the deck of an FBI-chartered yacht, to which he had been lured by
the prospect of a drug deal.
   Throbbing pain from the fractured wrists, sea sickness and the
lack of proper medical treatment ``placed him at a distinct
disadvantage where he could scarcely understand intelligently his
rights as explained and translated to him, much less be able to
voluntarily waive them.''
   The FBI agents gave Younis the only warning of his
constitutional right to remain silent shortly after he arrived
seasick on the USS Butte, a munitions boat that steamed four days
before meeting with the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga, Parker noted.
   ``They saw and knew that he was in a weakened state and
susceptible to persuasion,'' Parker said.
   Younis was kept in a windowless overheated room during the
voyage, which Parker called ``a clear abuse of the obligation to
bring the defendant before a judicial officer immediately following
his arrest.''
   The ship's ``slow voyage across the Mediterranean appeared to
serve only the government's purposes _ ample time to educe a
confession,'' Parker said in his 47-page opinion.
   Only after his arrival in Washington were Younis' fractured
wrists ``correctly diagnosed and appropriately treated,'' the judge
said.
   ``We are reviewing the decision carefully,'' Timothy J. Reardon
III, principal assistant U.S. attorney, said in a statement. FBI
officials declined to comment on the decision, said spokeswoman
Susan Schnitzer.
   The judge said he was also ``extremely troubled'' by the FBI's
failure to provide Younis with a lawyer during the interrogation,
particularly since the operation to arrest him had been carefully
planned.
   ``The government was not just bringing another defendant into
the station house for questioning,'' he said, also criticizing the
FBI for not using a video camera to record the interrogations.
   In addition to the videotape of Younis at the scene, the
government also plans to present testimony from two Americans who
were among the passengers and crew taken off the plane before its
destruction.
   The FBI also can rely on the testimony of Jamal Hamdan, a
one-time friend of Younis who lured him onto the yacht. Hamdan, who
lived in Cyprus, secretly taped conversations he had with Younis
about the hijacking.

   Now that a sculpture of three battle-weary
infantrymen stands near the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, some
senators want to place a bronze statue of an Army nurse nearby to
honor the 10,000 women who served in the Southeast Asia conflict.
   Several leading veterans' organizations applaud the proposal by
Sens. David Durenberger, R-Minn., and Alan Cranston, D-Calif. But
Maya Lin, the young woman architect who designed the memorial,
isn't happy.
   ``I cannot see where it will all end,'' she said at a Senate
hearing Tuesday. ``What is to stop someone from trying to add a
female statue to the Iwo Jima Memorial?''
   Ms. Lin was supported by others who warned that unless officials
stop caving in to pressure for more additions, the Vietnam memorial
will turn into a ``sculpture garden'' of special interests ranging
from native Americans to scout dogs.
   J. Carter Brown, chairman of the Commission of Fine Arts which
rejected the women's statue proposal last October, said the
original memorial _ now bearing the names of 58,156 war dead
including eight nurses on its black granite walls _ symbolically
includes all Vietnam veterans.
   He said the addition of the sculpture of three infantrymen
triggered envy among other groups who felt left out. His commission
believed that ``including a white, Army nurse would only continue
and exacerbate that process of exclusion,'' he said.
   At a crowded hearing by a Senate Energy and Natural Resources
subcommittee, Robert W. Doubek, former executive director of the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund, said a woman's sculpture would
``destroy the symbolism and aesthetics of the memorial.''
   But John P. Wheeler III, chairman of the private fund which
raised $11 million to build the memorial, supported the nurse's
statue and discounted ``the threat of a sculpture garden'' cited by
critics.
   Donna-Marie Boulay, a Minneapolis lawyer who served in Vietnam
as an Army nurse, testified that the statue should be erected
because nurses shared ``the intensity, the trauma, the carnage of
war'' with infantrymen.
   She is chairman and co-founder of the Vietnam Women's Memorial
Project, a non-profit organization founded in 1984.
   Durenberger's bill, which has 56 Senate co-sponsors, specifies
that after a woman's statue is placed at the 2.2-acre site near the
Lincoln Memorial, ``the Vietnam Veterans Memorial will be complete
and no further additions to the site should be authorized or
undertaken.''
   The bill, if enacted, would require the three agencies whose
approval is required _ the Interior Department, the fine arts
commission and the National Capital Planning Commission _ to
reconsider the proposal within 90 days. The statue has been
approved by the Interior Department but rejected by the other two
agencies.
   The memorial, which is administered by the National Park
Service, has become the most popular tourist attraction among all
the federal monuments in the capital. An estimated 20 million
people have visited the memorial since it was dedicated in 1982.

<HEAD>U.S. Falling Down on the Public Works Job</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America's commitment to necessities such as
transportation, water supply and waste disposal is barely adequate
and will fall far short of future needs without sharply increased
spending on public works, a federal council warned today.
   The report to the president and Congress calls for twice as much
annual capital spending for public works projects over the next
dozen years and suggests a broad range of possible money sources
from higher federal fuel taxes to local ``impact fees'' on
developers.
   ``In most cases we cannot rely simply on wiser spending. We also
must generate additional sources of funding,'' declared the report
by the National Council on Public Works Improvement.
   The council was established by Congress four years ago to take a
close look at the nation's problems with its ``infrastructure,'' a
bureaucratic term covering a variety of public projects from
highway and airport construction to water management and disposal
of toxic wastes.
   ``The quality of America's infrastructure today is barely
adequate to meet current requirements and insufficient to meet the
demands of future economic growth,'' the report concludes.
   The group acknowledged that major increases in spending for
public works may be difficult amid growing federal budget
pressures, and perhaps even impossible until the federal budget
deficit is reduced. But it said such spending ``must rank high
among our priorities.''
   In a report card on each major type of public works, the council
gave no failing grades but suggested that a far better job needs to
be done in all areas. The country's battle to deal with toxic
wastes was given a D, and a C or C-minus was awarded for coping
with mass transit, solid waste disposal and waste water treatment
needs.
   Managing water resources was given a B, the best grade, followed
by B-minuses for aviation and water supply management.
   ``In general the aviation system has handled rapid increases in
demand safely and effectively. ... Congestion is the system's
primary problem,'' said the council.
   Discussing hazardous wastes, the council said that while
spending to clean up contaminated sites has increased fivefold in
the last two years, ``only a small fraction of the 2 tons of waste
per capita produced in America each year is being treated safely.''
   On water quality, the council suggested that governments at all
levels have been fighting a losing battle.
   ``Despite (a) $44 billion federal investment in sewage treatment
since 1972, water quality has not improved significantly. ... due
in part to uncontrolled sources of pollution such as run-off from
farmland and roadways,'' said the report.
   Overall capital spending for public works projects totaled $45
billion in 1985, the latest year for which figures were available.
The council said the amount of spending by all levels of government
and the private sector will have to double by the end of this
century if future needs are to be met.
   The report said overall spending on public works has declined
from 3.6 percent of gross national product in 1960 to 2.6 percent
in 1985. While spending on operations and maintenance has kept pace
with economic growth, capital spending has fallen from 2.3 percent
of GNP to 1.1 percent.
   Government spending for public works at all levels has declined
from 20 percent of total government spending in 1950 to 7 percent
in 1984, the report continued.
   ``In effect we're drawing down past investments without making
commensurate investments of our own,'' said the report. ``Failure
to reverse this decline will exact a high price for the nation in
the future both in the cost of deferred investment and in reduced
economic competitiveness.''
   The council endorsed the ``general principle'' that users and
beneficiaries of public works projects, including developers, be
required to pay a greater share of the cost of such projects.
   It also criticized the hoarding of money in various federal
public works trust funds so that the federal budget deficit will
appear smaller. In 1987 the unspent balances in the federal
highway, transit, aviation and waterway trust funds totaled nearly
$24 billion, the council said.
   ``Federal user fees paid in good faith by beneficiaries to
preserve and protect public works systems (should) be spent for
that purpose,'' the report said.

<HEAD>Delvalle May Be Ready to Break with Noriega, Sources Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials say they are receiving signs
that Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle may be ready to
disassociate himself from military strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Any such move would further weaken Noriega and possibly hasten
his demise as the dominant force in Panamanian politics, the
officials said.
   The Reagan administration looks upon Noriega as the principal
obstacle blocking its goal of an eventual transition to elected,
civilian-led rule in Panama.
   The officials, who asked not to be identified, said Delvalle has
privately expressed his intention for many weeks to distance
himself from Noriega but they recognize that such a step would
require considerable courage.
   ``We get information from all sorts of sources, including
friends and relatives, that he is about to do something along these
lines,'' one official said. Congressional sources, also insisting
on anonymity, said they have heard the same reports.
   Since last summer, the administration has been publicly
encouraging Panama's military officers to withdraw from politics as
a means of promoting a return to rule by civilians. In the
meantime, much of the U.S. aid program to Panama has been suspended
and Panama has expelled all U.S. aid personnel.
   Two federal indictments against Noriega on drug trafficking
charges added a new dimension to the already strained relationship.
The indictments, handed down in Florida earlier this month,
portrayed Noriega as a key member of an international drug
smuggling conspiracy. In the Congress, opposition to Noriega spans
the political spectrum.
   Delvalle assumed the presidency in 1985 under circumstances
which strongly suggested that Noriega had forced his predecessor,
Nicolas Ardito Barletta, from office.
   It was a constitutional succession but Delvalle has been widely
perceived as no more than Panama's titular head.
   Noriega has maintained that executive authority rests with
Delvalle and that Panama has achieved a full transition to
democracy. Noriega says his U.S. critics are campaigning against
him for the purpose of annulling the Panama Canal treaties, under
which the waterway reverts to Panamanian control at the end of 1999.
   Attempts to obtain comment from the Panamanian Embassy on
Delvalle's purported intentions were not successful.
   For the United States, the stakes in Panama are extraordinarily
high. The administration believes that a democratic, politically
stable Panama offers the best assurance for the continued efficient
operation of the canal.
   The U.S. officials noted that challenging Noriega would not be
an easy step for Delvalle. They said Delvalle's extensive business
interests and his family could be threatened if he breaks with
Noriega. In addition, Delvalle's health is said to be tenuous
because of a heart operation.
   However, the officials said Delvalle has become increasingly
disturbed by his ties to Noriega and that some of his friends have
rebuffed him because of that association.
   Delvalle also may be tempted to act because of Panama's growing
financial crisis. ``The country is falling apart all around him,''
said one source.
   Lawrence Chewning Fabrega, a Panamanian diplomat who resigned
recently in protest over Noriega's rule, said in an interview this
week that the country's financial problems are so severe the
government may not be able to meet its payroll next month.

   Stung by complaints that it revived
Vietnam-era spying on political protesters, the FBI has initiated
top-level reviews of terrorism investigations that could interfere
with legitimate activity.
   FBI officials said Tuesday that the policy results from problems
with an increasingly controversial investigation of a group
opposing President Reagan's Central America policies.
   In that probe, some FBI field offices came ``very close'' to
conducting an improper political investigation of the Committee In
Solidarity with the People of El Salvador, despite warnings from
headquarters, said FBI Executive Assistant Director Oliver B.
Revell.
   While vigorously defending the legitimacy of the March 1983-June
1985 investigation, Revell told the Senate Intelligence Committee
that neither he nor former FBI Director William Webster _ now head
of the CIA _ closely supervised the probe.
   The investigation ended without filing of any charges, but
before it was completed FBI agents had collected information not
only on CISPES members but also more than a hundred other groups
and individuals opposed to Reagan policies. Targets of the
surveillance included Roman Catholic nuns, college professors and
labor union officials.
   FBI spokeswoman Sue Schnitzer acknowledged to a reporter that
the new reviews were ``related to'' the First Amendment concerns
arising from the CISPES investigation.
   In addition, FBI Director William Sessions has ordered an
internal investigation of the bureau's conduct specifically in the
CISPES case.
   CISPES has accused the FBI of investigating its members solely
because of its political stance, recalling FBI surveillance of
opponents of the Vietnam War.
   The Vietnam-era surveillance came under intense congressional
criticism in the 1970s and led to attorney general's guidelines
intended to govern the bureau's investigative conduct.
   Tuesday, several members of the Senate Intelligence Committee
told Revell they believe the bureau acted on flimsy evidence to
keep the CISPES investigation alive.
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, complained that CISPES was targeted
for ``a nationwide dragnet-type operation'' while investigations of
Reagan's Central America supporters were ``much more limited, more
surgical.''
   Revell said ``we have taken interim steps to increase the level
of review'' of sensitive investigations conducted under the largely
classified guidelines for international terrorism probes.
   Under the new policy, Ms. Schnitzer said, the conduct of
international terrorism investigations will be reviewed by a deputy
assistant director who reports to Revell _ who has responsibility
for all criminal investigations.
   Revell told the senators that Webster was ``aware of several
cables sent to him for informational purposes'' in the CISPES
probe, but ``he did not authorize, nor did I authorize any
supervisory activity. That occurred at the sectional level'' three
steps below Revell.
   Ms. Schnitzer said Webster and Revell ``had a limited amount of
knowledge'' of the CISPES investigation.
   International terrorism investigations _ such as the CISPES
probe _ are conducted under guidelines which do not require the FBI
to have evidence of a specific crime.
   In the CISPES investigation, the FBI said it had information
that some CISPES members were planning violent activities in the
United States, possibly in conjunction with the FMLN _ the
coalition fighting the U.S.-backed government of El Salvador. The
bureau characterizes the FMLN as a ``terrorist'' organization.
   The bureau also said CISPES members were investigated after
bombings at the U.S. Capitol and the Army National War College at
Fort McNair in Washington in 1983, although no evidence against
them was found.
   Revell said much of the information that started and fueled the
investigation came from Frank Varelli, a former informant in Dallas
whose information proved to be a ``mixed bag ... some blatantly
false, some concocted in his own mind.''
   ``That did result in the investigation being misled in certain
material facts,'' said Revell, adding the bureau only discovered
the problem ``after the fact.''
   Varelli is now suing the FBI, saying it still owes him money for
his informant work.
   Revell also said the FBI made a mistake when it disseminated _
under a ``secret'' classification _ derogatory information received
about CISPES from a conservative group. The information from the
Young America's Foundation was sent to 33 field offices.
   ``I did not approve it or sign it,'' Revell said. ``I would not
have. ... It was inappropriate to indicate that the views of
another organization should be considered by our investigators.''

<HEAD>War Of Words Escalates In Final Days of Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DAKAR, Senegal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This West African nation votes for
president and National Assembly on Sunday in a multiparty election,
a rarity on a continent dominated by one-party and military
governments.
   With only five days left until national elections, the war of
words escalated Tuesday as four presidential candidates and six
political parties wound up campaigning.
   Opposition politicians accused the Socialist Party, which has
ruled since independence from France in 1960, of rigging Sunday's
elections in advance and sending armed militias to break up
opposition party gatherings.
   The president and Socialist leader, Abdou Diouf, 52, a tall,
angular technocrat, is widely expected to retain his seat and
legislative majority.
   But young voters in some urban areas may back Abdoulaye Wade, a
61-year-old lawyer who leads the Senegalese Democratic Party, the
country's largest opposition group. Wade has called for change in
the government's generally conservative, pro-Western policies.
   Tensions were high in the cities, where there have been sporadic
student strikes and stone-throwing incidents between young
supporters of the different parties.
   Wade's party has formed its own ``people's resistance
committees'' to safeguard its meetings.
   ``We will mobilize our supporters to go to the polling
stations,'' said Ousmane Ngom, a party spokesman. ``If we see
fraud, we will occupy the Interior and Communications ministries to
prevent them from announcing their fraudulent results. If we think
we have the majority, we will declare victory and declare a new
government.''
   Diouf said Monday the government was ``prepared to deal with all
excesses,'' and there will be ``no liberty for the enemies of
liberty.'' He has insisted the elections will be free, fair and
democratic.
   Diouf has governed the country since 1981, when he took over
from retiring leader Leopold Sedar Senghor.
   Other candidates in the presidential race are Babacar Niang, 59,
of the People's Liberation Party, and Landing Savane, 43, of the
Revolutionary Movement for a New Democracy.
   Niang and Savane, a Maoist, have both said they have little
chance of winning and are participating to show there is an
alternative to the Socialists.
   Serigne Diop, former Wade supporter and leader of the Senegalese
Democratic Party for Renovation, backed Diouf's candidacy but hoped
to win legislative seats for his own party.
   The Marxist-oriented Democratic League-Labor Movement, led by
Abdoulaye Bathily, 43, also offered only legislative candidates.
   In 1983, Diouf retained the presidency and his party took 111 of
the 120 seats in the National Assembly in the country's first
multiparty elections. Wade and other opposition politicians claimed
that election was marred by fraud.
   Wade has again accused the government of distributing voter
registration cards through Diouf's party rather than through
independent registration committees. He also said the government
radio, television and semi-official Le Soleil newspaper have given
preferential coverage to Socialist candidates.
   Opposition politicians have criticized the country's austerity
program, which is backed by the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank, but which has brought a reduction on civil service
openings for university graduates and other belt-tightening
measures.
   Earlier this month, four Senegalese gendarmes, two
non-commissioned officers and three police sergeants were arrested
on charges of plotting the secession of the Casamance, Senegal's
southernmost province.
   Violent separatist demonstrations led by ethnic Diola agitators
in the Casamance capital, Ziguinchor, in December 1983, caused more
than 100 deaths. Scores of ringleaders were later sentenced to long
prison terms and the main secessionist association was outlawed.
   Senegal has a population of 7 million. The largely agricultural
nation has suffered from recurring droughts and the southern

   An admitted prostitute led a protest
at the Capitol against a bill that would require AIDS tests for
convicted prostitutes and their customers.
   ``Prostitutes are not spreading AIDS,'' Carol Leigh said Tuesday
at a rally outside the capitol. She and about a dozen demonstrators
accused lawmakers of making prostitutes the scapegoats in political
battles over AIDS.
   ``Prostitutes use safe sex,'' said Leigh. ``Do ordinary people
use safe sex? No.''
   ``We want (AIDS) education. We want to be able to do a good
job,'' said Leigh, a member of the prostitutes' rights group, Cast
Off Your Old Tired Ethics (COYOTE).
   The bill would require prostitutes and their customers to
complete an education course and undergo screening for acquired
immune deficiency syndrome after their first conviction.
   A vote on the bill is scheduled for next week.

<HEAD>Miners, OCAW Reject Merger of Energy Workers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 11 grafs to UPDATE with merger talks collapsing,
comments from both unions. Picks up 10th graf pvs `Before a ...'</NOTE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers on Tuesday
rejected a proposed merger with the United Mine Workers, just hours
before the two unions were poised to announce the deal, officials
said.
   ``There's a decision from OCAW not to go forward,'' that union's
spokesman, Rod Rogers, said late Tuesday. ``I don't know that that
sets everything in concrete. But that's where it stands for now.''
   A news conference had been tentatively set for Wednesday to
announce the merger, but the OCAW backed out after meeting with UMW
leaders most of Tuesday afternoon.
   The merger was intended to bolster the strength of the two
energy workers' unions, whose memberships have been shrinking
throughout the last decade.
   The OCAW's rejection sent UMW President Richard Trumka and his
executive board members into a late-night meeting at a Denver hotel.
   UMW spokesman Joe Corcoran said only that ``a snag'' had come
``from the OCAW side, not the UMW.''
   The UMW board had voted Sunday in Denver to approve the merger,
a union source said. It was not clear Tuesday night whether UMW
officials would make any further offers to the OCAW.
   Rogers said earlier Tuesday that a merger between the unions,
which each claim about 100,000 active members, would be logical for
several reasons, including ``consolidation of resources.''
   ``Nowadays we (the two unions) are kind of in the posture of
negotiating with the same companies, and that's because the major
oil companies own the lion's share of the energy and coal reserves
in the United States,'' he said.
   A cooperative negotiating effort between the two unions was
announced in 1986 at a special UMW constitutional convention
attended by OCAW President Joseph Misbrener.
   At that convention, the miners' union also gave Trumka and the
union's 24-member governing board the power to approve affiliations
or mergers with other unions.
   Before a merger could take effect, however, it would have to be
approved by OCAW's rank-and-file at a constitutional convention.
The union's next regularly scheduled convention is in August.
   At the UMW's 1986 convention, Trumka told delegates that the two
unions would work to compile information on their common employers
leading to their coincidental contract expiration date, Jan. 31,
1988.
   ``The two titans of the energy union movement, the Mine Workers
and the OCAW, have agreed to link themselves with computer and to
share information about the multinationals where we both represent
our members,'' Trumka said.
   The UMW and the Bituminous Coal Operators Association have
ratified a new national wage agreement, but the UMW is continuing
negotiations with the Pittston Coal Group Inc., a major producer
that dropped out of the association.
   OCAW has reached contract agreements with all the major oil
companies. However, strikes are in progress at four refineries
owned by Mobil Oil or British Petroleum, which also owns Standard
Oil of Ohio.
   About one-third of the OCAW membership is covered by new
contracts, with negotations for the rest continuing at the district
level, Rogers said.

<TEXT>
   An appeals court has struck down a $1
million judgment won by a man who claimed that his sexual identity
changed when his bicycle was struck by a soft-drink delivery truck.
   In a decision released Tuesday, the three-judge panel of the
Michigan Court of Appeals agreed unanimously that errors made in
jury instructions by Wayne County Circuit Judge Louis Simmons
required reversal of the award.
   The appeals court ruling came in a case involving Joseph
Pickens, who was injured Sept. 18, 1978, in Inkster when his bike
collided with a Pepsi-Cola truck.
   Pickens, 16 at the time of the accident, charged negligence and
said that after the accident ``he was a transsexual _ inclined to
identify with the opposite sex,'' the court said.
   ``His theory ... was that prior to the accident he was
predisposed to transsexualism and that the accident `triggered' the
condition,''' the appeals court said.
   The jury found Pepsi-Cola negligent and awarded Pickens $1.07
million in damages.
   But Pepsi contested some jury instructions, including one saying
Pickens had a right to cross the street at the intersection. The
company said he had that right only if the light was in his favor
and he could do so safely.
   The appeals court agreed, saying that there was a dispute over
who had the green light and that Simmons' instruction implied that
Pickens had the green light.
   Terrence Haggerty, attorney for Pepsi-Cola, said the company
``feels the court decided the matter correctly.''
   Sanford Roth, attorney for Pickens, said he was ``quite
disappointed'' but added he had not seen a copy of the ruling. He
said he did not know if he would appeal to the state Supreme Court.

   Leftist rebels fired machine
guns at a bus traveling in defiance of their first transportation
ban of 1988, killing three textile workers and wounding six,
authorities reported.
   The insurgents, who have fought the U.S.-backed government for
eight years, ordered the ban to protest legislative and municipal
elections scheduled March 20. They say free and fair elections are
impossible because of the civil war.
   Rebel broadcasts said the traffic ban began on Monday and would
continue indefinitely.
   Police officials said the guerrillas attacked a bus belonging to
the United Textile Industries Corp. as it traveled Monday night on
the Pan-American Highway east of San Salvador.
   The victims were identified as workers for the company, which is
partly owned by the government.
   The guerrillas, grouped as the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, warned people to stay off the nation's roads and
highways. They said in a broadcast on their clandestine Radio
Venceremos that their troops had orders to attack vehicles
violating the ban.
   Bus dispatchers contacted by telephone said the threat halted an
estimated 90 percent of traffic between cities and reduced public
transport by 80 percent within cities.
   The rebels called seven transport bans in 1987. In those, three
people were killed, about 30 wounded and about 160 vehicles
destroyed or damaged.
   In another development, four American religious workers were
detained by the military for 21 hours in the war-crippled northern
part of the country before being released Tuesday to the U.S.
Embassy, according to sources with the Mennonite Central Committee.
   It was the second time in less than a week that U.S. lay workers
had been picked up by the armed forces. Last Thursday, two
Episcopalian women from California were detained briefly before
being turned over to U.S. Embassy officials.
   In early January, the armed forces' Joint Chiefs of Staff issued
a statement to some church officials asking that the number of
foreign religious workers be restricted in war areas.
   According to Mennonite sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, the volunteers were detained Monday in San Jose Guayaba,
15 miles north of the capital of San Salvador. They were released
into the custody of U.S. Vice Consul Mark Schall.
   The volunteers were identified as Larry Leaman-Miller, 26, of
Nevada, and his wife, Korla, 28, of Iowa, no hometowns available;
and Gary and Nancy Guthrie of Landisville, Pa.

   A strong earthquake shook Manila and
wide areas of the Philippine main island of Luzon on Wednesday but
there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.
   The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the
tremor, which occurred at 11:52 a.m. local time and lasted for
nearly a minute, measured 5.3 on the Richter scale, but the U.S.
Geological Survey in Golden, Colo. said the quake registered 6.9 on
its seismographs.
   The Richter scale measures ground movement as recorded on a
seismograph. An earthquake with a magnitude of 6 can cause severe
damage.
   Bob Nofable, a spokesman for the Philippine institute said
seismologists calculated the epicenter of the earthquake to be off
the coast of the island of Cantanduanes, 245 miles southeast of
Manila. He said it was followed by several aftershocks.
   The earthquake shook tall buildings in Manila, but officials
said they were not aware of any damage.
   The government-run Philippine News Agency said the tremor was
felt strongest in the cities of Legazpi and Naga, both in the Bicol
region on southeastern Luzon, where people rushed out of homes and
offices and into the streets.
   The news agency quoted officials in Legazpi as saying the
earthquake was strong enough to cause cracks on concrete buildings
but did not say if any buildings there were actually damaged.
   The earthquake also was recorded by the Pacific Tsunami Center
in Honolulu, Hawaii, but center officials said it was not strong
enough to generate Pacific-wide tsunamis or tidal waves.

<TEXT>
   Up to 20 million Americans are in line for
some temporary tax relief when they file their returns this year _
and many apparently are totally unaware.
   President Reagan considers the relief so important that he has
asked Congress to make it permanent, at a cost to the treasury of
$400 million a year.
   The benefits are limited to owners of shares in publicly offered
mutual funds that have at least 500 shareholders. The provision is
one of those special-interest amendments that seem to find their
way into every tax bill, especially when those bills are written
behind closed doors.
   This one has its roots in the 1986 tax overhaul. As part of that
big change, the itemized deduction for miscellaneous expenses was
limited to those that exceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income.
   Thus, a taxpayer's deduction of union dues, subscriptions to
job-related publications, work uniforms and the like would be
restricted to the portion exceeding that income threshold. For
example, if adjusted gross income was $30,000 and miscellaneous
deductions totaled $2,000, only $1,400 could be deducted.
   In writing the 1986 tax law, the Senate at the last minute
included a section, aimed at preventing tax evasion, that prohibits
a ``pass-through entity'' _ such as a mutual fund _ from deducting
an expense that an individual could not deduct.
   As a result, managers of mutual funds are dividing up their
operating costs among shareholders, who are treated as if they had
received those costs as income. They must list this income on their
tax return.
   This ``phantom income,'' argued the Investment Company
Institute, which represents managers and underwriters of mutual
funds, ``cannot be banked, cannot be invested and cannot be used to
buy groceries. The only thing it is good for is to pay taxes on.''
   But could not the recipient simply write off the ``phantom
income'' as an investment expense? Sure _ if the recipient itemized
deductions. Maybe.
   Unless a shareholder's total miscellaneous expenses exceeded 2
percent of his or her adjusted gross income, the mutual-fund
writeoff would be lost. But the shareholder would still have to
list the money as taxable income.
   In the closing days of the 1987 congressional session,
tax-writers meeting behind closed doors agreed there was some
inequity and gave shareholders relief for another year.
   That means mutual-fund expenses that are reported to a
shareholder as income for 1987 may be deducted as a miscellaneous
expense without regard to the 2-percent threshold. Other
miscellaneous expenses will, of course, still be subject to the
threshold.
   This relief became law in late December, but word is slow
getting out. Money magazine, in asking 50 professional tax
preparers to calculate the liability of a hypothetical family,
found that 20 of the 50 were not aware of the change.
   Internal Revenue Service offices in several cities say they have
never heard of the change. The only mention of the provision in IRS
publications is a caution to taxpayers that Congress was
considering some relief when the literature went to press.
   But the last chapter has yet to be written. In the 1989 budget
that he sent to Congress last week, Reagan asked to make permanent
the relief for mutual-fund holders _ an idea that already has wide
support among congressional tax-writers.

<HEAD>Workers Dynamite Collapsed Building, Find Two More Bodies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil defense workers found two
more bodies when they blew up what remained of a building that
collapsed during flooding and mudslides that killed at least 80
people in Rio de Janeiro.
   President Jose Sarney toured some of the worst-hit areas on
Tuesday as residents of the city of 5.6 million cleared away dirt
and debris left by three days of torrential rains that began Friday.
   Civil defense workers on Tuesday combed through the wreckage of
the three-story building in the Santa Teresa district overlooking
downtown Rio after using dynamite to explode what was left of the
structure.
   Most of the building, which housed a medical clinic, collapsed
under a mudslide, killing at least 11 elderly patients. A civil
defense spokesman, Bruno Avila, said workers expected to find 10 to
15 more bodies in the rubble.
   He said rescue workers found two other bodies in Rio on Tuesday.
   Sarney, flanked by Cabinet ministers and Rio state officials,
flew aboard an air force helicopter to view the hillside
shantytowns where cascading mud and rocks buried dozens of shacks.
The president also visited the mountain resort city of Petropolis,
40 miles north of Rio, where floods and landslides earlier this
month killed at least 167 people.
   According to civil defense figures, a total of 276 people have
died in the Rio de Janeiro area because of unusually heavy rains
since Feb. 2.
   In the working-class neighborhood of Abolicao, on Rio's north
side, firefighters and volunteers dug through the rubble of a
three-story apartment building on Tuesday. Since it collapsed
Sunday, 12 bodies and 14 survivors have been pulled from the
debris. Residents said a teen-age girl remained missing.
   Government and private engineers said there was still a risk of
new landslides in 27 mountain shantytowns.
   Donations and pledges of food, clothing, medicine, tents, beds
and money poured in from other states and foreign countries,
including the United States.
   State health officials vaccinated Rio residents against tetanus
and leptospirosis, a potentially deadly disease carried by rat
droppings.
   Rio state hospitals reported 162 cases of leptospirosis and at
least six deaths from the disease.

   After four months without a news conference,
President Reagan faces questions tonight on hostage-taking in
Lebanon, Israel's crackdown in the occupied territories, and the
bitter fight by Republicans wanting to succeed him.
   Reagan also may be asked about his embattled attorney general,
Edwin Meese III, the target of an investigation by an independent
counsel, and the separate felony convictions of former White House
aides and presidential confidants Lyn Nofziger and Michael K.
Deaver.
   Also still awaited is Reagan's reaction to a plan by House
Democrats for $25 million in ``humanitarian'' aid for Nicaragua's
Contras, a package that was put together after rejection of the
president's proposal to give the rebels new weapons.
   On the political front, Reagan has doggedly steered clear of
involvement in the GOP presidential race. However, he may be
tempted to comment on the increasingly sharp words between
Republicans, given that he is the author of the so-called 11th
commandment forbidding Republicans to speak ill of each other.
   The 8 p.m. EST session in the East Room will be Reagan's first
news conference since last Oct. 22, which was dominated by
questions about the 508-point collapse of the stock market.
   A lot has happened since then, and Reagan has had little to say
except in prepared speeches. He has been largely isolated from the
press, commenting only occasionally in response to a shouted
question as he boards a helicopter or to a query during a
picture-taking ceremony in the Oval Office.
   Tonight's session comes amid intense diplomatic activity by
Secretary of State George Shultz in Moscow and the Middle East.
   Shultz, who arrived back in Washington on Tuesday evening, was
reporting to Reagan today on his talks in Moscow about arms
control, the timing of a superpower summit and the likelihood of a
Red Army pullout from Afghanistan.
   All of those issues pose possible questions for Reagan.
   With barely a day back in the capital, Shultz leaves again
tonight, this time to the Middle East where he will meet with Arab
and Israeli leaders about efforts to revive peace negotiations.
   White House officials say there is an urgency to Shultz' efforts
in the Middle East because of the violence in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza. The United Nations says 63 Palestinians have been
killed by Israeli gunfire since violence began Dec. 8.
   Shultz said Tuesday he has encountered ``intense skepticism''
about the chances of a breakthrough on Middle East negotiations,
but the United States has ``a few ideas'' that could help end the
deadlock.
   Reagan likely will be asked about the kidnapping in Lebanon of
Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins and the eight other Americans
seized there.
   Higgins, onetime aide to former Defense Secretary Caspar
Weinberger, was serving with U.N. forces when he was taken in
southern Lebanon last Wednesday. Reagan raised some questions by
saying he wanted ``to rescue'' Higgins, but aides later clarified
that he was referring to diplomatic efforts, not a military
maneuver.
   A group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on
Earth claims to have abducted Higgins. The group is demanding
Israeli withdrawal from the ``security zone'' it maintains in south
Lebanon, release of Palestinian and Lebanese prisoners held by
Israel and suspension of U.S. diplomatic activity in the Middle
East.

<HEAD>Delaware Senator Released From Hospital, But Faces More Brain
Surgery</HEAD>

   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. wore a blue baseball
cap to hide his scar as he left Walter Reed Army Medical Center 12
days after undergoing brain surgery that will have to be repeated
in a few months.
   Doctors said they were ``delighted'' with Biden's recovery from
surgery Feb. 12 to repair an aneurysm in an artery supplying blood
to the senator's brain.
   But a hospital statement said that a second aneurysm has been
found and will have to be corrected later.
   Biden, 45, left the hospital Tuesday by car with his wife, Jill,
and his brother, Jim Biden of Washington.
   A family spokesman, Larry Rasky, said the Democrat from Delaware
was under orders to rest at home and was to have no visitors nor be
given office work.
   Biden, said Rasky, is ``in great shape and great spirits. He's
full of vigor. I think if the doctors hadn't told him to rest, he
could have gone to the office.''
   Rasky said the family purposely avoided announcing the senator's
plan to leave the hospital in order to avoid the stress of any
media interest.
   But Biden and his wife paused briefly beside their car to pose
for a photographer. Biden's blue cap covered the scar on his left
temple where the surgical incision was made. He smiled broadly as
the camera shutter clicked.
   The hospital statement said neurosurgeons earlier had found the
additional aneurysm on the opposite side of the brain from the
aneurysm that was repaired.
   ``The second aneurysm is smaller and could not be approached
during the earlier surgery,'' the statement said. ``There were no
signs of leakage, but the second aneurysm will require surgical
repair.''
   No date has been set for the new operation, the statement said.
It added: ``Procedures of this type are usually done after the
patient has fully recovered from any earlier surgery, usually
within two to three months.''
   Rasky said doctors told Biden the second surgery could come in
less than three months, if his recovery went well, and that
recovery from the new operation would take less time. But the
spokesman said the senator will not return to his Washington office
until he has recovered from the second surgery.
   A doctor associated with the case, who asked not to be
identified, said that about 15 percent of all patients with one
cerebral aneurysm will develop another. If the aneurysm is small,
stable and not bleeding, he said, it can be left and repaired later.
   Biden's release just 12 days after surgery, said the doctor,
shows ``he is doing very well.''
   An aneurysm is a weakened area in an artery. The pressure of
blood flow causes the area to balloon, forming a blister-like flaw
on the artery side.
   Aneurysms are dangerous because they can rupture suddenly and
hemorrhage, or they can leak. Such bleeding from a cerebral
aneurysm can quickly cause brain damage or death.
   Biden was admitted to Walter Reed on Feb. 12 after a
middle-of-the-night, emergency transfer from a Delaware hospital.
He had been taken to the Delaware hospital the day before after
experiencing severe neck pain and nausea.
   An X-ray test located the aneursym within his skull and he
underwent surgery within hours.
   The doctor associated with the case said then that about
one-third of all patients with cerebral aneurysms die.
   Typically, the doctor said, surgery for a brain aneurysm
requires an incision in the temple area. Surgeons then cut a small
window in the skull to enable them to lift the brain slightly and
locate the flawed artery.
   The aneurysm is corrected by permanently attaching a clip, a
small metal device with locking jaws, at the base of the
blister-like flaw and parallel to the blood flow. Eventually, the
artery will heal itself.
   Biden had been treated for a neck pain that started two weeks
before his surgery. A doctor diagnosed the ailment as a pinched
nerve and possibly a viral infection of neck muscles. The senator
wore a neck brace as treatment.
   When the pain left after several days, Biden abandoned the brace
and went on a speaking tour. But the pain, along with nausea,
recurred. The senator was admitted to a hospital near his
Wilmington, Del., home and then transferred by ambulance to Walter
Reed.
   A doctor said an aneurysm leaking into the brain cavity can
cause neck pain.

<HEAD>Investigators Say Quid Pro Quo Latin For `Planned Payoff'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The ``quid pro quo'' in a memo to Attorney
General Edwin Meese III may be a planned payoff to the Israeli
Labor Party, say government sources familiar with a criminal
investigation of Meese.
   The Sept. 25, 1985, memo from longtime Meese friend E. Robert
Wallach discusses an Israeli commitment not to bomb a proposed $1
billion Iraqi oil pipeline.
   ``We all recognize that there would be no progress to this
point'' had Israeli-born Swiss oilman Bruce Rappaport ``not been
able to obtain the security package which involves the
never-to-be-stated but fully understood quid pro quo which helped
to produce that commitment,'' said Wallach's memo. The memo doesn't
elaborate.
   Meese's attorneys say the ``quid pro quo'' is a reference to an
agreement that Rappaport, a partner in the proposed pipeline, would
make available to Israel substantial amounts of oil generated from
the project. Wallach was Rappaport's lawyer.
   However, investigators for independent counsel James McKay
question the explanation of Meese's lawyers and are seeking to
determine whether the language may be a reference to planned
payments to the Labor Party, said the government sources, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Wallach gave Meese the ``quid pro quo'' memo, along with a
handwritten letter from then-Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres in
which Peres said he ``would go a long way to help'' the pipeline.
   One of Meese's lawyers, James Rocap, said the attorney general
doesn't recall any discussion of the memo with Wallach, who
hand-delivered the documents to the attorney general. Rocap said
Meese did not read the memo closely.
   Wallach's memo urged Meese to enlist support for the pipeline
project from top U.S. officials, hinting that he might talk to
Secretary of State George Shultz about it and then proposing a
discussion with President Reagan.
   Meese's lawyers say he took none of the initiatives suggested by
Wallach, but only referred Peres to the office of then-National
Security Adviser Robert McFarlane.
   A separate Wallach-to-Meese memo also dated Sept. 25, 1985,
spells out Rappaport's close ties to Peres, saying the businessman
described an arrangement in which Israel will receive up to $700
million over 10 years from the pipeline.
   ``What was also indicated to me, and which would be denied
everywhere, is that a portion of those funds will go directly to
Labor,'' says the second memo, the focal point of McKay's criminal
investigation. Meese says he doesn't recall reading the portion of
the document relating to Labor Party payments.
   The independent counsel is investigating whether Meese knew of a
possibly improper payment plan involving the Israeli political
party and, if so, why he did not do something about it.
   The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it illegal for U.S.
citizens, companies or their agents to offer foreign officials
anything of value to influence them to provide help in business
matters.
   The law states that the attorney general may file a civil suit
if it appears the person or company is about to engage in an act
that would violate the law.
   Both memos were publicly released Monday, along with an exchange
of notes between Peres and Meese.
   Peres, now Israel's foreign minister, on Tuesday defended his
communications with Meese, saying: ``We all agree that we favor the
laying of the pipeline. So why would anyone need to use bribes?
Nobody said he (Meese) gave the Labor Party anything or proposed
anything to the Labor Party.''
   However, Peres acknowledged Tuesday through a spokesman in
Jerusalem that the Israeli government had been offered a discount
on oil purchases amounting to $65 million to $70 million a year in
return for approving the pipeline, The Washington Post reported in
today's editions.
   But the aide said that Peres did not take the offer seriously
and failed to pass it on to colleagues, the newspaper said.
   In another development, Arthur L. Liman, the chief counsel for
the Senate committee that investigated the Iran-Contra affair, says
the Justice Department should have turned over Wallach's memos when
the committee subpoenaed material.
   One of the memos refers to Israeli help in efforts to free
American hostages held in Lebanon, and quotes Rappaport as saying,
``There is a feeling the United States `owes' and that the
accomplishment of this (pipeline) project ... is appropriate.''
   ``I would like to have questioned Meese about this,'' Liman was
quoted as saying in today's editions of The New York Times.

   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., said today it would be unwise to threaten to pull U.S.
troops out of Europe to counter pressures inside West Germany for
the removal of all nuclear weapons from German soil.
   ``The appearance of the use of threats by the United States does
the Germans a disservice,'' Byrd said in testimony prepared for
delivery before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   ``Threatening Europe with a diminished American commitment if
Europe does not undertake certain specific actions would be
counterproductive,'' the Senate leader said.
   Byrd said that the Senate delegation he led to Europe earlier
this month concluded that ``no responsible German official
contemplates denuclearizing Germany.''
   Some West Germans do advocate eliminating all U.S. nuclear
systems in the aftermath of the successful negotiation of the
U.S.-Soviet treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear weapons from
the continent.
   But Byrd said most West German leaders reject that as a step
leading to domination by Moscow's superior weight in non-nuclear
arms such as tanks, artillery and aircraft.
   Byrd said the top priority for NATO now must be the forging of a
detailed and comprehensive proposal on conventional arms reduction
to present to the Soviet Union this year.
   On Tuesday, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said
President Reagan's vision of a world free of nuclear weapons is
neither obtainable nor desirable.
   ``I do not believe this is possible and I do not believe our
leaders should create the impression that it is possible, let alone
desirable,'' he said.
   Kissinger said he was concerned about the West being exposed to
Soviet superiority in conventional weapons should nuclear weapons
be abolished.
   Kissinger told the committee he believes the Senate should
ratify the new treaty eliminating medium-range nuclear weapons in
Europe, if only to avoid a bruising and divisive political upheaval
inside the NATO alliance.
   But Kissinger said he believes the treaty is ``flawed and leaves
us in a weaker position, both politically and militarily.''
   He said he was especially troubled by the treaty's reduction of
U.S. and Soviet missiles to zero on each side because of the
expectations that may create in the negotiation of a treaty
reducing long-range strategic nuclear arms.
   ``It implies that zero in all categories is obtainable, and it
is not obtainable,'' Kissinger said.
   He said the treaty should be ratified, if for no other reason,
because keeping a force of U.S. Pershing and ground-launched cruise
missiles in Western Europe is now politically impossible.
   The treaty is the result of NATO's 1979 ``dual-track'' decision
to deploy U.S. weapons to counter Soviet SS-20 medium-range
missiles while at the same time negotiating their removal.
   It calls for the destruction of all missiles with a range from
300 miles to 3,400 miles.
   Kissinger said he believes the treaty is flawed because it will
not reduce in any significant way the ability of the Soviet Union
to devastate Europe with other nuclear weapons and because it
substantially reduces the ability of the United States to retaliate
with nuclear weapons based in Europe.
   Nuclear deterrence in Europe will now rely primarily on weapons
based in the United States and Kissinger said that creates ``a
psychological and political imbalance,'' especially when weighed
against Soviet superiority in conventional forces.

   The dollar closed slightly higher against the
Japanese yen in Tokyo today after a sharp decline the previous day,
while share prices gained for the 10th consecutive day.
   The dollar closed at 128.75, up 0.25 yen from its closing figure
of 128.50 yen Tuesday, when it lost 1.45 yen. It had opened at
128.90 yen today but never went higher, changing hands between
128.57 and 128.90 yen.
   The dollar came under selling pressure after a statement by
Satoshi Sumita, head of the Japan's central bank, who told
reporters today that the U.S. currency's sharp decline has hit
bottom, but that unstable factors remained, such as large external
imbalances among major economic countries.
   The dollar rebounded somewhat as life insurance and securities
firms went on buying the currency just before the end of trading,
Abe said.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei average of 225 selected
shares, a 102.74-point winner Tuesday, took on an additional 19.20
points, or 0.07 percent, to close today's session at 24,968.65
points.
   ``The small gain shows investors are becoming careful,'' said an
analyst with Sanyo Securities, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   But he noted that the volume of trading was a hefty 1.1 billion
shares, the heaviest this year, and said: ``If the volume stays at
the current level, the stock average will easily top the
27,000-point level.''
   Large-size issues, such as shipbuildings and steels, were
bought, and chemicals, papers, brokerages and real estate issues
were firm.

   President Reagan wants Congress to bar federal
agencies from releasing information that he says could harm the
economic competitiveness of the United States in the new field of
superconductivity.
   The proposed change in the Freedom of Information Act was one of
three proposals Reagan submitted to Congress on Tuesday in a
message in which he said the United States sometimes falls short in
making commercial use of laboratory breakthroughs.
   The other proposals would broaden the present protection for
patents on manufacturing processes and require courts to consider
the effects of joint commercial ventures on international
competitiveness before deciding they violate antitrust laws.
   Reagan said he was proposing the information law change because
``commercially valuable scientific and technological information
generated in federal facilities loses potential commercial value
when it is released wholesale'' under the act.
   ``Mandatory disclosure of such information under FOIA could
encourage U.S. competitors to exploit the U.S. science and
technology base rather than making investments in their own
research and development infrastucture,'' the president said.
   Under his proposal, Reagan said, ``federal agencies will be
required to withhold information of this nature requested under the
Freedom of Information Act where disclosure could reasonably be
expected to harm the economic competitiveness of the United
States.''
   Reagan said his proposal would apply to ``federal
government-generated, government-owned scientific and technical
information.'' In addition, he said, the administration is
developing ``a uniform policy to permit federal contractors to own
the rights to technical information that they develop for the
government.''
   Although the three legislative proposals were lumped together
under the title ``Superconductivity Competitiveness Act of 1988,''
the president's message did not indicate that their application
would be limited to the field of superconductivity.
   The federal government spent about $55 million on
superconductivity research in fiscal year 1987 and will spend more
than $100 million in the current fiscal year, Reagan said.
   ``There is no time to waste in this effort,'' he said. ``There
is a growing realization that, although the United States has long
been a leader in breakthroughs in the laboratory, it has
occasionally failed to convert these breakthroughs into commercial
applications.''
   Reagan proposed amending patent laws to give U.S. companies the
right to sue and collect monetary damages in U.S. courts when
someone else uses their processes abroad to manufacture products
that are then shipped to, and sold in, the United States.
   They can already file such suits to prevent the use of their
processes by domestic manufacturers, but must sue foreign
manufacturers in foreign courts in order to collect damages. The
White House said the proposed change ``is consistent with the
treatment of process patents in many foreign countries.''

   The 1988 presidential campaign is making a
quick side trip to the nation's northeast corner this week for
lobster, maple syrup and votes, with Michael Dukakis and George
Bush nervously hoping for neighborly victories in Maine and Vermont.
   With their strong regional ties, Dukakis and Bush need to win
their parties' caucuses in Maine this weekend and the Vermont
primaries Tuesday to build momentum for Super Tuesday.
   But former television evangelist Pat Robertson and Senate GOP
leader Bob Dole would like to embarrass Bush in his home territory
_ especially in the wake of Bush's weak showings in Tuesday's South
Dakota primary and Minnesota caucuses.
   In both Maine and Vermont, strong Bush and Dukakis organizations
will carry the burden, for all the candidates will be spending most
of the next seven days campaigning in the South, focus of the Super
Tuesday's primaries on March 8.
   The Republican vice president will touch down for airport news
conferences today in Portland, Me., and Burlington, Vt. _ his last
scheduled visits for the week. Dukakis may be back in Maine by the
weekend.
   Bush has a home in Maine and is widely expected to be the winner
in the town caucuses in the state scattered over the weekend.
   But his campaign is worried about Robertson in Maine.
   With a usual turnout of only about 5,000 Republicans, the
caucuses are a good opportunity for success using Robertson's
tactics from other states _ flooding caucuses with new participants
and winning surprising victories.
   The Dukakis campaign, which has a strong organization on the
ground as it did in New Hampshire, faces less opposition among
Democrats, who have mostly left the states to the governor from
neighboring Massachusetts
   ``It doesn't appear that the other campaigns are taking these
states seriously,'' said Dukakis spokesman Leslie Dach.
   The one possible exception to the rest of the Democratic field's
bypassing of the states is Jesse Jackson in Vermont. The Rainbow
Coalition _ formed during Jackson's 1984 presidential bid _
actually has remained active in the state and Burlington's
Socialist mayor, Bernie Sanders, has endorsed him.
   ``The Rainbow Coalition has been working hard,'' said Vermont
Democratic chief Violet Coffin.
   But Dukakis, in contrast has had 12-15 paid staffers working the
state, she said.
   Neither of the states' events has drawn a great deal of
candidate's attention for several reason.
   First, Maine and Vermont together will send 41 delegates to the
Democratic National Convention and 39 delegates to the Republican
meeting this summer. The Super Tuesday events decide which
candidates have the allegiance of 1,307 Democratic delegates and
712 GOP delegates.
   Only the Maine caucuses actually begin the delegate selection
processes; the Vermont primary on Tuesday is simply a beauty
contest expression of preference. Vermont's delegates will be
picked in the late spring in a separate caucus process.
   But the close ties that Bush has with Maine make it an excellent
chance for Robertson to stun the front-runner in his home turf.
   ``It will be a battle,'' said Ron Kaufman, Bush's Northeastern
coordinator. ``Dole has had a lot of people on the ground in Maine.
... But my concern is the Rev. Robertson.''
   It is the potential of Robertson's ``invisible army'' of
supporters to take over the GOP caucuses that worries the Bush
staff.
   Maine GOP state chairwoman Karen Stram of Dresden sees the
caucuses this way:
   ``The Bush campaign has the broadest organization. Robertson has
organized a lot of new voters. ... The Dole people have an
organization that has been working here.''
   On the Democratic side in Maine, state party chief Rick Barton
acknowledges that Dukakis has a home-field advantage, but he says
another candidate could have an impact. ``The question is whether
anybody is making an effort here'' besides Dukakis, Barton said.
   And he pointed out that there is a seventh candidate contending
in the Maine caucuses _ uncommitted. Led by Maine House leader John
Diamond, party activists have been pushing for uncommitted
delegates to be elected at the city and town meetings.
   In Vermont, Dole has the potential for a good showing, although
the vice president is credited with a broader organization. Dole
has the backing of several GOP leaders, including former Gov.
Richard Snelling.
   Vermont Republican party chief Ralph Howe said Dole _ from the
farm state of Kansas _ has also won points with the state's dairy
farmers by supporting changes in the milk price support program
that Bush has not endorsed.
   In Dukakis' home state of Massachusetts, which votes on Super
Tuesday, the governor enjoys a prohibitive lead among Democratic
presidential candidates, while Bush leads the GOP field, a new poll
indicates.
   The survey, commissioned by WCVB-TV in Boston, WEEI radio and
The Boston Globe, was conducted by the Gallup organization among
Massachusetts voters last weekend. It said Dukakis led with 61
percent support, with Gephardt trailing with 13 percent. The other
Democrats finished in single digits.
   In the Republican race, Bush _ a Massachusetts native _ led with
49 percent, compared to 29 percent saying they support Dole. Those
others were in single digits, with 8 percent undecided.
   The telephone survey of presidential preference involved 639
registered Democrats with a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percent. The poll also reached 331 Republicans, with a margin of
error of plus or minus 6 percent.

<HEAD>Scientists Discover Dinosaur Egg With Possible Embryo</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMERICAN FORK, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dinosaur egg discovered in a
central Utah quarry may contain the oldest embryo ever found and
change perceptions about how some of the creatures became extinct,
a scientist says.
   A scan of a partially collapsed egg the size of a human fist has
revealed a 2-centimeter-long gray area that appears to be the crude
outline of an embryo, said Wade Miller, a Brigham Young University
paleontologist.
   In the scan, the egg shell appears white. Most of the egg's
interior is dark gray except for a tiny area that has the shape of
a head and other features, Miller said.
   The egg was discovered last September in the Cleveland Lloyd
Quarry where scientists have uncovered thousands of allosaurus
bones, a meat-eater that stood up to 20 feet high.
   Miller said skeletal remains of the dinosaurs that lived during
the Jurassic Period, which began around 210 million B.C. and ended
145 million B.C., have ranged from 100-pound juveniles to 3-ton
adults.
   William Lloyd Stokes, professor emeritus at the University of
Utah and one of the scientists who excavated most of the bones,
said dinosaur eggs usually cannot be associated with a particular
species, but because this egg was found among a great deposit of
allosaurus bones, it likely was from an allosaurus.
   It is among the oldest eggs or egg fragments ever discovered,
and if it in fact contains an embryo, would be the oldest dinosaur
embryo found, Stokes said.
   Miller said the egg could lead to a new theory of how dinosaurs
in the area became extinct.
   Miller said geologists previously believed the dinosaurs in the
quarry were trapped in a bog.
   ``A dinosaur is not going to lay an egg in a bog while it's
sinking,'' he said.
   But Stokes disputed that.
   ``The egg has to be formed within a body, and while it is in a
body that body may sink,'' he said Tuesday night.
   Stokes said the fact that other eggs and egg fragments were not
found in the quarry indicates this egg was not in a nest.
   Miller said the egg will be taken to Maryland where Columbia
Scientific Inc. will take three-dimensional X-rays of it.

   Some elections are more equal than others, fortunately for
George Bush. He was trounced twice in Republican presidential
contests, but he'd left the scene of the landslides.
   Sen. Bob Dole, who won a runaway in South Dakota and a
comfortable victory in Minnesota, said he had gained major headway
as the GOP race moved toward the South.
   ``It pays to come to South Dakota,'' he said Tuesday night in
Sioux Falls.
   But the pay wasn't very high.
   Dole apparently swept the delegates at stake in South Dakota _
all 18 of them. Pat Robertson was second, just below the 20 percent
it took to share in the delegation. Bush lagged narrowly behind him.
   But compare that delegate payoff to Texas. Republicans there
will choose 111 nominating delegates on March 8, and Bush ranks as
the favorite. His role and Dole's are reversed in Texas _ the vice
president leads and the senator from Kansas has virtually written
off the state.
   In Democratic competition Tuesday, Rep. Richard Gephardt
captured South Dakota, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis won in
Minnesota, and nobody got any nominating delegates. The results
were purely advisory; the real prizes come later.
   Those results, especially the defeats Bush absorbed by running
third in South Dakota and fourth in Minnesota, were muted for lack
of the attention concentrated on the leadoff presidential contests
in Iowa and New Hampshire.
   Dole and Gephardt won in Iowa, Bush and Dukakis in New
Hampshire, in contests played to national television audiences,
with anchormen on location. The states were comparable, the stakes
were comparable, but Tuesday's contests were not magnified by being
first.
   So Bush, campaigning in London, Ky., absorbed the twin defeats
without a word of comment. It's time for targeting, and the next
one on his list comes this weekend in Maine, where he maintains a
home and where he expects to win in GOP caucuses.
   That's also a Robertson target, and the Bush camp says the
former television evangelist could pose a significant challenge in
caucuses, the kind of competition that best fits his organization.
   Robertson said Bush should pay in the national public opinion
polls for the defeats on Tuesday. ``I don't see how he's going to
continue to ride so high,'' Robertson said. ``The vice president is
definitely wounded.''
   But it is nothing Maine, and the just-for-show Vermont primary
on March 1, can't heal.
   Those contests, and the South Carolina primary on March 5, with
Robertson formidable and claiming he can win, all preface Super
Tuesday, March 8. That's a 20-state primary and caucus day, with
1,307 Democratic delegates and 712 Republicans at stake.
   That competition is concentrated in the South, but it includes a
half-dozen contests in other regions, Massachusetts to Washington.
   With candidates picking their spots and with delegates to be won
through proportional representation among the Democrats, Super
Tuesday isn't likely to be any more conclusive than what has gone
before.
   Republican rules make it more likely that one candidate can pile
up a significant delegate lead on March 8.
   Ironically, for all the efforts at calendar rigging and
early-season decisions, the pivotal primaries may still be weeks
away, in populous industrial states like Pennsylvania, New York,
Ohio, and, finally, California.

<HEAD>Sugar Payments and Lamb Quotas Would Get Ax Under House Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House lawmakers are hoping to melt some of the
ice around their sweeping trade bill with proposals to drop
Senate-sponsored curbs on lamb imports and $400 million in payments
to sugar refiners.
   ``I think there is a need for trade legislation,'' House Ways
and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said Tuesday
after the plan was sent to senators on a conference committee
drafting the trade bill. ``If we don't get it this year it could
very well mean that we won't get it for some time in the future.''
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
promised early consideration of the offer proposed by Ways and
Means Committee members who are also part of the conference
committee.
   Bentsen said there could be a reply as early as the weekend from
Finance Committee members on the conference committee. The
so-called ``subconference'' of Ways and Means and Finance members
is one of 17 such bodies that have been formed to draw up portions
of the 1,000-page bill.
   The lamb provision would limit imports of fresh chilled or
frozen lamb meat. It was attached to the Senate version of the
trade bill at the urging of Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.
   The sugar provision would let some refining companies that claim
tney are being hurt by high tariffs recover some $400 million in
duties they paid a number of years ago on imported sugar that was
refined and re-exported.
   The Reagan administration was fiercely opposed to it, saying
insufficient documents existed to administer the plan properly.
   At a news conference, Rostenkowski again expressed hope the
House would pass an overall compromise ``before the Easter recess''
but said that might not be possible.
   One issue remaining is Democratic presidential aspirant Richard
Gephardt's amendment to require 10 percent annual rollbacks in
Japanese trade surpluses with the United States.
   The measure, approved by the House, does not appear in the
Senate version and it seems likely to be changed in the final
product.
   Gephardt, a member of the Ways and Means Committee, has been
basing part of his campaign on his trade proposal and other
Democrats on the panel have been reluctant to do anything that
might be interpreted as undercutting him.
   Rostenkowski indicated that no reshaping of provisions dealing
with unfair foreign trade barriers is likely before the ``Super
Tuesday'' primaries in the South on March 8. The chairman was an
opponent of Gephardt's plan when it was debated in the House last
year.
   He indicated, however, that he would present the case for
Gephardt's plan.
   ``I've been commissioned by the House of Representatives to do
as much as I can to keep as much of it in as I can, and I'm going
to do that,'' he said.
   After a report on Monday that lawmakers would ``dump'' the
Gephardt provision following the Super Tuesday voting, Rostenkowski
issued a statement saying that ``Mr. Gephardt's amendment has not
been scuttled or jettisoned.''

   Country music's reigning top entertainer Hank
Williams Jr. says his Academy of Country Music Awards nominations
would have made his legendary father, and his mama, proud.
   ``I keep thinking in Ernest Tubbs' last song `Leave Them Boys
Alone,' it says, `His daddy would be proud if he could see Bocephus
now,''' Williams, whose nickname is Bocephus, said after receiving
six nominations Tuesday.
   ``I think of mama, too, she would have said, `I told you honey,
he was going to do it all the time,''' the 38-year-old son of Hank
Williams said from his home in Paris, Tenn.
   Gentleman ex-frycook Randy Travis also got nominations in the
same categories: Entertainer of the Year, vocalist, single, song,
album and video categories.
   Williams, current Country Music Association and academy
Entertainer of the Year, and Travis, who dominated the awards last
year with four trophies, are also up for Grammy Awards next month.
   ``We're very happy to be nominated and to be in such good
company,'' said Travis, 28, who fried catfish and burgers at the
Nashville Palace before getting his break.
   ``It's a great feeling to know that the industry enjoys our
music.''
   George Strait got four nominations _ top vocalist, single, song
and album. Nominees with three each were perennial favorite
Alabama, shut out on last year's show, and newcomers K.T. Oslin and
Ricky Van Shelton.
   The Bellamy Brothers, Crystal Gayle, The Judds, Reba McEntire
and Restless Heart got two apiece.
   Nominees for the 23rd annual ACM awards were announced by
country entertainers Dwight Yoakam, the group Restless Heart,
Charlie Pride and Lacy J. Dalton.
   Ballots go in the mail this week to the 2,500 academy members.
The winners will be announced March 21 during a two-hour NBC-TV
special with Williams and Miss McEntire hosts.
   In addition to Williams and Travis in the Entertainer of the
Year category are Alabama, Miss McEntire and Willie Nelson.
   The only major surprise was the poor showing of the multiple
Grammy nominee ``Trio'' album, which got the Academy's best album
nomination but no other mention for singers Dolly Parton, Linda
Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris.

   President Reagan's nominee to be secretary of
the Navy, William L. Ball III, is just one more reason to see
triple when looking at the administration.
   A look through the directory of top government officials shows
that this administration doesn't take a back seat to anybody in the

   At the Pentagon: Frank C. Carlucci III, secretary of defense; H.
Lawrence Garrett III, undersecretary of the Navy.
   At the Treasury Department, James A. Baker III, secretary.
   At the Office of Management and Budget: James C. Miller III,

secretary for economic development.
   At the Justice Department: Edwin Meese III, attorney general.
   At the Interstate Commerce Commission: J.J. Simmons III,
commissioner.
   In addition, the list shows Charles Tyroler II of the

<HEAD>Dole's Support Broad in South Dakota, Except for Strong
Conservatives</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republicans across the ideological spectrum
helped Bob Dole win the South Dakota primary, with the exception of
strong conservatives, whose support could prove important in later
contests, exit polls said.
   Those Republicans, one fifth of the total, favored Pat
Robertson, helping the former television minister challenge Vice
President George Bush for second place in the state primary
Tuesday, an NBC News exit poll found.
   Among Democrats, many voters chose a candidate in the final days
of the South Dakota campaign, and they went strongly for Rep.
Richard Gephardt, who employed aggressive television advertising in
his winning effort, polls said.
   A third of the Democratic voters told CBS News they made up
their minds in the last three days of the race, and 45 percent of
them backed Gephardt, to 23 percent for Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, who finished second.
   The television networks based their analyses of the voting on
random surveys of South Dakotans as they left polling places. The
networks did not conduct surveys in Minnesota, which held party
caucuses Tuesday.
   Dole, the Senate minority leader from Kansas, campaigned
determinedly in South Dakota. Bush, sensing his disadvantage,
steered clear of the state. The polls said Dole prevailed in nearly
all categories; ABC News, for example, said he won more than seven
in 10 liberals and moderates and four in 10 conservatives.
   NBC separated out another category, ``very conservative''
voters, and said 42 percent went for Robertson to 32 percent for
Dole and 17 percent for Bush. Dole did poorly among very
conservative voters in New Hampshire, where Bush won last week's
primary, and NBC noted that more such voters may turn out in the
Super Tuesday southern state primaries March 8.
   When considering Dole's overall strong showing, ``The caveat is
that Bush didn't contest it,'' and that Republican turnout was
light, said Doug Muzzio, an ABC poll analyst. Still, he said,
``Bush lost almost every group he won in New Hampshire,'' including
Republicans who support President Reagan and those who are
concerned about foreign policy.
   One important outcome was ``a narrowing of the margins,'' Muzzio
said: Sen. Paul Simon, a liberal Democrat, fared poorly, as did
Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, a conservative Republican.
   ABC said Kemp got just 8 percent of the conservative Republican
vote, to Robertson's 27 percent. Robertson also won more than half
the evangelical or fundamentalist Christians, about a fifth of all
GOP voters, ABC and CBS said.
   Among the Democrats, Gephardt and Dukakis split the liberal
vote, but Gephardt won moderate and conservative Democrats, won the
male vote while splitting the female vote with Dukakis, and won
among the less wealthy and the less educated, again splitting the
others with Dukakis.
   Gephardt ``went upscale'' by doing better among the
better-educated and wealthier Democrats than he had in the past,
Muzzio said. ``The good news for Dukakis is that he did well in a
downscale state,'' he added.
   Surprisingly, the NBC News poll found that a plurality of South
Dakota Democrats, 46 percent, said they believed Dukakis eventually
will win the presidential nomination, though not all voted for him.
   Even 28 percent of those who voted for Gephardt said they
expected Dukakis to be the nominee.
   CBS reported that 40 percent of the Democrats chose farm policy
as a key issue, more than the number that selected any other
subject.
   ``Gephardt was definitely strong among people who cared about
farm policy,'' with 55 percent support to 18 percent for Dukakis,
said CBS surveys manager Pam Mitchell.
   Among the losing Democrats, NBC found that former Sen. Gary Hart
of Colorado was viewed unfavorably by twice as many South Dakotans
as viewed him favorably, and 55 percent were not pleased that Hart
re-entered the race after withdrawing last summer amid questions
about his marital fidelity.
   NBC's poll had a margin of sampling error of 3 percent. The CBS
poll's margin of error was 4 percent, and ABC's was 5 percent.

   The 4,000 nuclear weapons that would remain in
Western Europe after elimination of intermediate-range nuclear
weapons should stay there until its conventional forces are better
balanced with the Warsaw Pact, President Reagan told a European
television audience.
   ``Ensuring the peace requires that these nuclear weapons stay
where they are until we can achieve a better balance of
conventional forces on the continent,'' Reagan said Tuesday.
``Because of them and the Soviet knowledge that we have them, we
can maintain the balance that maintains the peace.''
   Reagan spoke in a televised address broadcast by satellite to
Europe by the ``Worldnet'' facilities of the U.S. Information
Agency. The address came a week before leaders of the 16 NATO
countries gather at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels for
their first full-scale summit in six years.
   Reagan said the recently signed U.S.-Soviet treaty to abolish
intermediate-range nuclear forces _ missiles with a range of about
300 miles to 3,000 miles _ was ``a victory for NATO.''
   Nevertheless, he said, NATO must continue to have battlefield
nuclear weapons, those with a range of under 300 miles.
   ``The alliance's adversaries must not believe that our only
possible response to a limited attack is to begin an
intercontinental nuclear exchange,'' Reagan said. ``If they do,
they may doubt that we would risk such a response and be tempted to
test us.''
   West Germany has expressed opposition to upgrading short-range
missiles until NATO develops an overall arms control strategy and
the Soviet Union reduces it conventional force strength.
   Reagan said NATO must insure that it maintains ``all the modern
forces, both conventional and nuclear,'' to uphold a strategy of
flexible response to Soviet aggression.
   ``After all, our goal is not a nuclear-free or a tank-free or an
army-free Europe but a war-free Europe,'' Reagan said.

<TEXT>
   Kansas Sen. Bob Dole scored a solid
victory in South Dakota's Republican presidential primary Tuesday,
far outpacing Vice President George Bush, who had written off the
state. And Rep. Richard Gephardt came out on top on the Democratic
side after a campaign blitz.
   ``I took South Dakota very seriously,'' Dole said. ``Let the
message go out, that it pays to come to South Dakota.''
   Bush had sidestepped the Midwest contests and headed directly
South after his New Hampshire primary victory.
   Gephardt's win over Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis delivered
no nominating delegates, but gave Gephardt a victory to point to as
the candidates campaign in the Super Tuesday states. Dukakis,
however, scored a win of his own Tuesday night, in Minnesota's
caucuses.
   Dukakis was the resounding victor in the New Hampshire primary a
week ago; Gephardt won the Iowa caucuses eight days before that.
   The South Dakota primary was moved from its traditional June
date to the front of the nominating calendar this year.
   Gephardt, Dukakis and Illinois Sen. Paul Simon campaigned
heavily here. Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, Gary Hart and
Jesse Jackson also vied for support.
   Republican voters were choosing all 18 delegates the state will
send to their national convention next summer, while 15 of the 19
Democratic delegates were to be allocated on the basis of the
primary.
   The Democratic primary is legally non-binding because it falls
prior to the date allowed by Democratic National Party rules. But
state party officials have said they expect the March 12 statewide
caucus to apportion those 15 delegates according to the results of
Tuesday's primary.
   The South Dakota Legislature moved the presidential primary from
June to February in an attempt to draw candidates to a state that
was largely ignored by presidential contenders in past elections.
Backers of the move said it would force the candidates to pay
attention to South Dakota and the problems of rural America.
   With 99 percent of the precincts reporting, Gephardt had 44
percent; Dukakis, 31 percent; Gore, 8 percent; Simon, 6 percent;
Hart and Jackson, 5 percent.
   For the Republicans, with 99 percent of precincts reporting,
Dole had 55 percent; Robertson 20 percent; Bush 19 percent and Kemp
5 percent. Former Delaware Gov. Pete du Pont, who dropped out last
week, drew 1 percent.

<HEAD>Students Vote To Keep Nuke Cloud As School Symbol</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Some teachers are blasting a decision by
Richland High School students to retain a nuclear mushroom cloud as
their symbol, but supporters said the emblem did not signify atomic
destruction.
   Students in this ``atomic city'' voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to
formally adopt the mushroom cloud as the symbol of the Bombers.
   ``It stands for nuclear holocaust and the end of the world,''
said Jim Deatherage, a teacher who has long opposed the symbol.
``It's an inappropriate symbol for high school kids to be
glorifying.''
   Deatherage said students should not have made the decision since
they were easily swayed by emotions and did not understand the
objections of outsiders.
   ``They were tied to the symbol because of school pride,'' he
said. ``The whole process was a farce.''
   Deatherage and teacher Rick Wigre said opponents had only a few
chances to communicate with students or other teachers.
   ``It never came up at a faculty meeting,'' Wigre said, because
the administration did not want to divide the staff.
   But most students and administrators expressed satisfaction with
the process.
   ``Clearly that's what the kids wanted,'' said Lisa Koch, 18.
``I'm very pleased.''
   ``Students have a very simple view of it,'' said activities
director Steve Potter, who helped organize the election.
   ``To them it was a symbol of Richland High School,'' he said.
``No more and no less.''
   The issue is an emotional one in this city of 30,000 adjacent to
the Hanford nuclear reservation, where for more than 40 years the
federal government has made plutonium for nuclear weapons.
   Richland was a sleepy village of a few hundred residents when
Hanford was carved out of the central Washington desert as part of
the Manhattan Project to produce atomic bombs in World War II.
   Many of parents of the school's 1,300 students are employed at
the site _ where the government announced last week that plutonium
production is being phased out at the cost of 2,600 jobs during the
next two years.
   The symbol, which is the letter ``R'' with a mushroom cloud
rising above it, has been used for some 17 years, but was never
formally adopted by the student body.
   Over the years there have been attempts to eliminate it, and
some student leaders decided it was time to formally adopt a symbol.
   During a morning class Tuesday, students were given white
ballots with four symbols portrayed in black.
   There was no place to write in new ideas and no opportunity to
reject all four options, a factor criticized by some teachers and
students.
   The mushroom cloud received 1,084 votes, said Principal Gus
Nash. A caricature of an atomic bomb got 45, a B-17 bomber plane 40
and the symbol of three atomic rings 36 votes.
   ``I don't think the student body sees it as a symbol of
destruction or weaponry,'' said Marcia Cillan, vice president of
the Associated Student Body. ``I don't think it signifies anything
other than Richland High School.''
   ``We're not going to change it just because a bunch of people
are making fun of it,'' said student Glenn Goldberg.

<HEAD>Dukakis Wins Democratic Contest In Minnesota; Dole Outpaces
Robertson, Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Michael Dukakis racked up a win
outside his home turf of New England in the Minnesota Democratic
presidential caucuses, while Republican Bob Dole beat out George
Bush _ as did former television evangelist Pat Robertson and Rep.
Jack Kemp.
   With 80 percent of the Republican precincts reporting _ the last
official tally provided early today _ Dole had 43 percent;
Robertson, 28 percent; Kemp, 15 percent; and Bush, 11 percent. The
uncommitteds were 3 percent.
   And with 74 percent of the Democratic precincts reporting,
Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, scored 34 percent; Jesse
Jackson had 20 percent, Sen. Paul Simon, 18 percent and Rep.
Richard Gephardt, 8 percent. Gore and Hart each had 1 percent, and
19 percent were uncommitted.
   Gephardt won the South Dakota primary Tuesday night, setting the
scene for more battles for the front-running spot as he and Dukakis
head into a new round of contests.
   Dukakis won last week's New Hampshire primary, while Gephardt
was the victor in the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 8.
   Both Gore and Jackson have been campaigning heavily in the
South, and Gore, who bypassed Iowa and New Hampshire, is vowing to
come on strong in his native region.
   Gore, along with Hart, virtually ignored Minnesota.
   Bush, the Republican front-runner nationwide, made no effort in
Minnesota. In Kentucky, where he was campaigning, he went to bed
Tuesday night without commenting to reporters on the returns.
   For the first time in Minnesota, an attempt was being made to
report results of the caucuses on the night they occurred _ meaning
the preferences of all those who attended Republican caucuses based
on a straw poll and the preferences of delegates elected at the
Democratic caucuses.
   The caucuses began the process of selecting 78 of the state's
87-member delegation to the Democratic National Convention and the
31 delegates to the Republican National Convention.
   Moving the caucus date from March to February resulted in a
lengthy dispute between the state and national Democratic parties
because the new date is earlier than national party rules allow.
   The state party agreed that a presidential preference poll taken
at the Democratic caucuses would be kept secret until 5 p.m. March
8 and that the state party would not cooperate in reporting of
caucus-night results.

<HEAD>Shares Open Fractionally Higher, Then Fall Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices opened fractionally higher on the
London stock exchange today but then fell slightly in early trading.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Index was down 1.6 points
at 1,756.3 at 9:45 a.m. When the market officially opened at 9
a.m., the index was up 0.9 points at 1,758.8.
   Dealers said share prices had moved ahead strongly on bullish
sentiment about the British economy, but the market didn't find a
direction and major shares were narrowly mixed.
   The largest fall among the index of 100 shares was Consolidated
Goldfields, which dropped 12 pence to 818 pence because of weakness
in the gold price.
   Banks showed some of the largest gains, with Barclays up 6 at
480 and National Westminster up 8 at 558. Barclays increase was due
to release its 1987 earnings later today following National
Westminster which released its results on Tuesday.
   The early trend followed a small drop Tuesday in New York, where
the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.17 to 2,039.12, and a small
gain in Tokyo overnight, where the Nikkei index rose 19.20 to
24,968.65.

<HEAD>Wife To Appeal Ruling Against Her Smoking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT MILTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney for a chain-smoking woman
under court order not to smoke in her family's presence says he
will appeal the decision as ``outrageously unconstitutional.''
   The order barring Elizabeth Roofeh, 41, from smoking in front of
her husband and their three children was issued Tuesday by Justice
Ralph Diamond of the trial-level state Supreme Court.
   Mrs. Roofeh also was directed to confine her cigarette puffing
to a small television room in the couple's Kings Point mansion.
   ``This is clearly a violation of her First Amendment rights,''
said her attorney, Joel Brandes.
   ``Who is going to enforce this? ... Are the children going to
become policemen and turn their mother in for smoking?''
   The ruling is ``outrageously unconstitutional,'' he added.
   Mrs. Roofeh's husband, Jahanshah, 42, a non-smoking surgeon,
went to court in an attempt to get his wife to stop lighting up in
front of him and their children, ages 6, 7 and 9.
   He claimed he tried unsuccessfully for 12 years to get his wife
to curtail her two-pack-a-day habit. He described her smoking as
``offensive and detrimental to the health of the children.''
   The Roofehs, who were married in 1976, have been feuding since
May when Mrs. Roofeh filed for divorce, which is pending before
Diamond.
   The Roofehs are still living together.
   Mrs. Roofeh, who called her Iranian-born husband ``an
ayatollah,'' said she smokes ``just to annoy'' him. ``I'll quit
when I get him out of the house,'' she said.
   Neal Shayne, the dean of the Academy of Law for the Nassau
County Bar Association, said he believes the order was legal
because it's not Mrs. Roofeh's rights but the rights of her family
that were violated by her smoking.
   ``I think it's been established that smoking is certainly
hazardous to a person's health, especially to a young child,'' said
Shayne.
   Mrs. Roofeh said she has been limiting her smoking to the one
small room in the couple's six-bedroom home in recent months.
   ``It's nothing new,'' said Mrs. Roofeh in referring to the
constraints the judge has placed on her. ``I've always tried not to
smoke in front of the children.''
   Roofeh said when they were married his wife promised him she
would not smoke in front of him.
   She admits that she broke her promise in 1984 but it was because
of stress from a stroke she suffered. She also has admitted that
she used to sneak outside when she got an uncontrollable nicotine
craving before 1984.
   In issuing his ruling, the judge denied a request by Roofeh for
an order of protection against his wife.
   Roofeh had argued that smoking cigarettes may be as
``detrimental and reprehensible'' as would be ``hitting, slapping,
punching, or spitting.''
   The court found, however, that an order of protection is a tool
designed to protect family members from domestic violence and not
to protect against a spouse that smokes.
   Stephen Schlissel, attorney for Roofeh, commended the judge on
the decision.
   ``It is a natural extension of the law that if a child is being
harmed by a parent's conduct it should step in and safeguard the
child,'' said Schlissel.

   As the U.S. presidential election campaign picks up pace, it is
coming more and more under scrutiny in other nations. Here is what
some newspapers and commentators said recently about the election
process in general and about Super Tuesday in particular.

<HEAD>WEST GERMANY</HEAD>
<HEAD>`Unimaginable' Process</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ Sueddeutsche Zeitung of Munich (liberal): ``In a nation like
the Federal Republic (of Germany), where the parties have extended
their power into every corner of society, the drama par excellence
now occurring on the American stage would be unimaginable.
   ``Not the party, but the primary determines who will enter the
`final match' on Nov. 8. And the primary is close to the ideal
democracy imagined by Jean-Jacques Rousseau.
   ``The contenders must meet the voters face to face _ from
Alabama to Wyoming, in living rooms, schools and shopping centers.
And a candidate can climb into the ring with or without the
blessing of his party.
   ``Surprises are guaranteed.''

<HEAD>`Political Olympics'</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _The Japan Times of Tokyo (English-language, independent): ``The
strong belief remains that none of the Democratic candidates will
emerge as an unbeatable front-runner after Super Tuesday or later.
In this case, brokering will choose the candidate at the
convention, and waiting on the sidelines for just such a
development is New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   ``What may be understandable but nevertheless regrettable is
that campaigning so far resembles a `political Olympics' with a
concentration on percentage points in pre-ballotting polls and in
the results. This tends to obscure the issues, particularly in the
reporting by the media.''

<HEAD>Roughhouse Election</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ Neil Lurrssen, Washington correspondent, The Sunday Star of
Johannesburg (English-language, independent: ``The United States is
in for a roughhouse 1988 election season.
   ``It is going to be quite a spectacle. ... And the campaigning
shows every indication of deteriorating into a bare-knuckle brawl,
especially among the Republicans where the two leading candidates .
.. have already started slugging away at each other.''
   ``None of the other candidates is likely to shake the Bush-Dole
lead, though there could be a rude surprise for both of the leaders
in some parts of the South where former television evangelist Pat
Robertson has enthusiastic supporters. ... This could make Mr.
Robertson _ who has sympathy for the South African government _ a
significant factor at the party convention if there has to be
horsetrading of delegates to find a presidential nominee.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>BRITAIN</HEAD>
<HEAD>`Silly Season' is Past</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ The Independent of London (independent): ``It looked on
occasion last year as if America's ... method of selecting
presidential candidates was finally coming to pieces. There was
speculation that nobody of any ability or self-respect would
subject himself and his family to the intense strain and
scrutinizing involved in the race for nomination.
   ``Such questions no longer dominate the political agenda;
suggestions that the system is unable to throw up a credible slate
are rarely heard. The political silly season is, mercifully, past.
...
   ``The main problem for the United States has turned out not to
be the caliber of the leading candidates. It is, increasingly, the
quality of government in the final months of a lame-duck
administration.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>`Disappointing Comment'</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _ The Times of London (independent): ``Questioned on his defeat
by Vice President George Bush (in New Hampshire), Sen. Robert
Dole's first response was to rebut the `lies' put about by Mr. Bush
that he wanted to raise taxes. Evidently the last thing Mr. Dole
wanted to be associated with was a responsible fiscal policy which
he believed had cost him a significant number of votes at a crucial
stage in the presidential race.
   ``For the rest of the world this is a disappointing comment on
the nature of U.S. politics. But it hardly comes as a surprise. The
shadow of the presidential election has for months hung over the
struggle to rein back America's budget deficit. Its influence can
only increase as President Reagan's term draws to a close.''

<HEAD>`A Matter of Manners'</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Susan Crosland, wife of the former Labor Party Cabinet minister
Tony Crosland, the Sunday Times of London (independent). Writing in
her weekly column on what she perceived as a backlash against Dole
because he accused Bush of lying, she said raised the question with
a Washingtonian living in London:
   Q. ``Why is Bush's insincerity preferred to Dole's frankness?''
   A. ``If you speak from the heart and say that someone should
have lost, you're seen as a dirty player. It's a matter of manners.
As an example of American mores, when I say `How are you?' I don't
really care how you are.''

<TEXT>
   As thousands roared approval, Michael
Jackson moonwalked across the stage and declared, ``I'm bad,'' to
open his first solo U.S. tour.
   Jackson kicked off the 13-city tour Tuesday at 16,900-seat
Kemper Arena, where smoke machines, lasers, and 72 speakers
highlighted the performance.
   Ku Klux Klan leaflets were placed on numerous car in the parking
lot, but the only arrest was of a person suspected of being under
the influence of alcohol, police said.
   After another show here tonight, the pop singer moves to New
York City's Madison Square Garden in March.
   Jackson sang 17 songs Tuesday in a two-hour concert that opened
with smoke machines churning and the audience bathed in brilliant
white lights. An overhead video screen showed the image of
Jackson's legs moonwalking across it.
   Flanked by four dancers, and backed by four singers and a
seven-member band, Jackson appeared and slid into non-stop
gyrations to the throbbing beat of ``Wanna Be Startin' Somethin',''
one of the hits from ``Thriller,'' the 1983 blockbuster album that
sold 40 million copies.
   Many traveled for hours to get to the concert, but perhaps none
farther than Ivan Herman, 32, and Carla Vanparys, 27, who came from
their home in Brussels, Belgium. Herman said he also attended the
opening of the 1984 Victory Tour by Jackson and members of his
musical family.
   ``I've seen him six times,'' Herman said. ``He's gotten more
mature. He's more of a real person.''
   Some said they liked the idea of a solo tour.
   ``This time we get to focus on Michael, just his talents,'' said
Alonzo Washington, 20, of Kansas City, Kan. ``He's trying to prove
he's a talent, and not just hype.''
   During his rendition of ``Bad,'' Jackson was lifted on a
platform over the heads of the audience. While suspended there, his
coat and hair flapped in an artificial breeze as he sang, ``I'm
bad, I'm bad.''
   During ``Thriller'' he was enveloped in smoke and threw a white
hat to the crowd.
   Tickets were $30 when the Victory tour opened with a concert at
Arrowhead Stadium, home of the Kansas City Chiefs football team.
This tour, tickets at the much-smaller Kemper Arena were priced at
$23, but scalpers reportedly were getting up to $200.
   A fan from Tulsa, Okla., who won a free ticket to tonight's show
but can't ride a bus with other winners because of a disability was
given an airline flight, limousine service and hotel accomodations
by the tour's sponsor, Pepsi-Cola Co.
   Alan Stephens, 18, won promotional tickets from Tulsa radio
station KMOD, but cannot travel by bus because he suffers from
Lesch-Nyhan Sydrome, which causes him to strike himself and limits
the use of his limbs.
   Other stops on the tour are St. Louis; Pittsburgh; Minneapolis;
Cleveland; Denver; Chapel Hill, N.C.; Indianapolis; Cincinnati;
Houston; Louisville, Ky.; and Birmingham, Ala. Other dates may be
added, tour officials have said.

   Rep. Jack Kemp, R-N.Y., has joined the field
for Indiana's May 3 Republican presidential primary.
   Kemp campaign officials Tuesday filed the required ballot
petitions in the office of the secretary of state. Bob Poor of
Greencastle, Kemp's Indiana campaign chairman, said the petitions
contained 6,300 signatures.
   Indiana law requires a candidate to have 500 petitioners from
each of the state's 10 congressional districts.
   Kemp and Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas are the only GOP candidates to
file so far. The filing period ends March 4.

<TEXT>
   State and Democratic Party officials say
at least three Democratic presidential contenders will not be
running statewide on Ohio's May 3 primary ballot because they
failed to file slates of delegates in one or two of the state's 21
congressional districts.
   The secretary of state's office said Tuesday that while official
lists will be compiled by March 1, it appears former Sen. Gary Hart
of Colorado, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Jesse Jackson
will not run statewide.
   All of the other major presidential candidates in both parties
apparently fielded slates in all districts, although Democrat Bruce
Babbitt and Republican Pete DuPont have abandoned their campaigns
and their names apparently will be withdrawn.
   Democrats whose statewide candidacies appeared assured include
Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, Illinois Sen. Paul Simon and
Sen. Albert Gore, Tennessee. The Republicans are Sen. Robert Dole
of Kansas, Vice President George Bush, Congressman Jack Kemp of New
York and Pat Robertson.

   Supporters of Jesse Jackson have become the
first of the six announced Democratic presidential candidates to
file petitions for a spot on the crucial April 19 New York primary
ballot.
   While the Jackson camp showed up Tuesday at the state Board of
Election with more than six times the required number of
signatures, state board spokesman Steven LaFever said they had been
beaten to the ballot by ``uncommitted.''
   LaFever said supporters of uncommitted slates of delegates, put
together by a group of elected Democratic county clerks from across
upstate New York, had filed petitions containing 18,816 signatures
on Monday.
   Democratic candidates have until midnight tomorrow to file
petitions containing at least 10,000 signatures with at least 100
coming from each of 17 of the state's 34 congressional districts.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis enjoys a prohibitive lead
among Democratic presidential candidates in his home state and Vice
President George Bush leads the Republican field in the
Massachusetts primary on March 8, according to a new poll.
   The survey, commissioned by WCVB-TV in Boston, WEEI radio and
The Boston Globe, was conducted by the Gallup organization among
Massachusetts voters last weekend.
   The survey said Dukakis led the Democratic field with 61 percent
support, followed distantly by Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt with
13 percent.
   In the Republican race, Bush _ a Massachusetts native _ led with
49 percent, compared to 29 percent saying they support Kansas Sen.
Bob Dole.
   The telephone survey of presidential preference involved 639
registered Democrats with a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percent. The poll also reached 331 Republicans, with a margin of
error of plus or minus 6 percent.

<HEAD>Disabled Follow Politics But Have Trouble Voting, Poll Suggests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disabled Americans express greater interest in
politics than other citizens, but they register and vote at a rate
considerably lower than the general public, according to a recently
released survey.
   ``Our findings suggest that barriers, either external or
internal or both, prevent many disabled Americans from converting
their exceptionally high political interest into actual electoral
activity,'' said Humphrey Taylor, president of Louis Harris and
Associates, which conducted the poll.
   The most common barrier cited for disabled people was lack of
transportation and difficulty in getting to the polls, problems
noted by 29 percent of the respondents. Twenty-one percent said it
was difficult to stand or walk.
   The telephone poll of 536 disabled people nationwide, conducted
in June and July 1987, found that 53 percent said they follow
government and public affairs most of the time.
   In comparison, only 26 percent of all U.S. adults pay attention
to politics much of the time, according to a 1984 National Election
Study by the University of Michigan.
   The survey had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent.

<HEAD>Judge Sentences White Man To NAACP Work After Attack on Blacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white man who admitted chasing two blacks with
a baseball bat was ordered to perform 200 hours of community
service for the NAACP by a judge trying to help him overcome racial
hatred.
   ``He has been taught to hate black people for some reason,''
said Cook County Circuit Judge Stuart Nudelman. ``I'm trying to put
him in an environment where he can perhaps do some good and learn
something about the people he thinks he hates and perhaps learn
that his feelings are misguided.''
   James Kalafut, a 21-year-old plumbing company laborer, pleaded
guilty to aggravated assault and ethnic intimidation and could have
been sentenced to a year in prison, the judge said after sentencing
him Tuesday.
   Kalafut was charged in August after he and a group of other
whites _ brandishing baseball bats, throwing bottles and shouting
racial slurs _ chased two blacks from a transit stop in Gage Park,
a predominantly white neighborhood on the Southwest Side.
   Nudelman placed Kalafut under his supervision for one year and
ordered him to perform 200 hours of community service work for the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   Details of when Kalafut will serve the sentence are to be worked
out in the next few days by his attorney, Barry Silver, the NAACP
and the judge.
   Silver said before the sentencing that Kalafut would accept the
agreement to perform community service and no appeal would be
attempted.
   ``I think it's a good sentence given the fact that he's
basically pleaded guilty to hating a minority group,'' Silver said.
   ``By being with black people, he will have a chance to learn
they are no different than he is except that the color of their
skin is different.
   ``I think that is an important lesson for anyone to learn,
especially someone who has been involved in this kind of
activity,'' Silver said.
   The attorney said Kalafut, who declined to be interviewed, was
``concerned about his own personal safety when he is in the
neighborhood of the NAACP,'' located on the South Side.
   Silver said Kalafut also was concerned about being rejected by
NAACP officials and being ``made the scapegoat in a sort of reverse
discrimination.''
   But the civil rights organization plans to make sure that
doesn't happen, said Edward McClellan, president of the South Side
branch.
   ``Certainly we don't presume there are only white racists or
what have you,'' said McClellan, who wasn't sure what type of work
Kalafut would perform. ``Racism can be engendered by anyone
inclined to that sort of prejudice.''
   Nudelman said that trying to help Kalafut overcome his prejudice
against blacks made more sense than sentencing him to jail, ``where
he won't learn anything except more hatred.''
   But the judge warned, ``If he ... doesn't do what he's supposed
to, he'll come back before me and I'll sentence him to jail.''

<HEAD>Survey Finds Women Out of House But Still in Kitchen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's been a quarter century since Betty Friedan
helped launch the women's movement with her book ``The Feminine
Mystique,'' but a recent survey indicates women still do most of
the cooking and grocery shopping.
   When most couldn't persuade the men they live with to help out,
women of all income levels devised their own methods of easing the
burden, mainly by cutting the time they spend in the kitchen, The
New York Times reported today.
   The Times conducted telephone interviews with 1,870 people
nationwide between Oct. 29 and Nov. 5 and found that while more
women are in the work force and have less time at home, they remain
the primary care-givers and the ones who pay attention to ``how,
when, what and where their families eat.''
   Among married couples surveyed, only 18 percent of men said they
do the family's main food shopping; 6 percent more said they share
the responsibility with someone else at home.
   Meanwhile, 91 percent of married women said they do the
shopping, with 3 percent saying the chore is shared.
   Working full time outside the home didn't seem to make much
difference. The study found that 90 percent of married women who
work full time said they do the principal family shopping.
   As for preparing meals, 90 percent of married women surveyed
said they do most or all the cooking in their homes, compared with
just 15 percent of married men.
   Last month, a magazine survey reported that 77 percent of
working mothers queried said they prepare dinner by themselves _
and 64 percent said they do the after-dinner cleanup alone, too.
   In its February issue, Working Mother magazine also reported
that its survey found 92 percent of working-mother respondents do
the laundry regularly in their households.
   According to that study, whereas husbands and children do the
laundry regularly about 25 percent of the time, 27 percent of

<HEAD>Wheat To Have First Year-To-Year Increase In Four Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The outlook for U.S. wheat farmers has
improved significantly, aided in part by huge subsidized sales to
the Soviet Union.
   An additional sale of 700,000 metric tons to the Soviets was
announced Tuesday by the Agriculture Department. Overall, exports
are expected to rise more than 50 percent from last year, reducing
the U.S. wheat stockpile to the lowest level in six years.
   In a related analysis, the department's Economic Research
Service said the rising demand and shrinking inventories have
boosted wheat prices well above last year's harvest lows of about
$2.28 per bushel.
   Over the entire wheat marketing year, which began last June 1,
the national average farm price is expected to be in the range of
$2.55 to $2.65 per bushel, up from $2.42 in 1986-87, the report
said. That will be the first year-to-year increase since 1983-84.
   Looking briefly at 1988 harvest prospects, the report noted that
plantings of winter wheat last fall for this summer's harvest were
the smallest in 10 years. Spring wheat plantings may be up slightly
if strong prices entice farmers away from the USDA's 1988 acreage
program.
   ``However, weather remains the leading determinate of 1988's
wheat crop,'' the report said.
   The latest sale, equal to about 25.7 million bushels, was
handled by Continental Grain Co., 150,000 tons; Tradigrain Inc.,
50,000; Louis Dreyfus Corp., 250,000; Cargill Inc., 100,000; and
Peavey Co., 150,000.
   At recent prices averaging $2.76 per bushel, the wheat would
have a farm value of about $71 million. That is a five-day average
price through Feb. 19, adjusted to reflect prices received by
farmers.
   More than 6.3 million tons of subsidized wheat have been sold to
the Soviet Union under the department's Export Enhancement Program,
or EEP, for delivery in the year that began last Oct. 1.
   William L. Davis, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said an additional
500,200 tons of wheat are still available to the Soviet Union under
current EEP authorization.
   Under EEP, private exporters are given surplus commodities owned
by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. so they can sell a
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive
world prices.
   The sales also are part of the grain the Soviet Union is
committed to buy during the fifth and final year of a long-term
agreement, which calls for the annual purchase of at least 9
million tons of U.S. grain. The pact expires Sept. 30.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat or soybeans, or 39.4 bushels of corn.
   In addition, 1.67 million tons of U.S. corn, 800,000 tons of
soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal have been bought by
the Soviets for delivery this year.

   Agriculture Department economists say
consumers soon will see lower prices for lettuce.
   ``Lettuce shipments and prices should return to normal this
spring as harvesting moves north from California's Imperial Valley
and spring brings improved weather,'' according to a report by the
department's Economic Research Service. ``Both grower and retail
lettuce prices likely will decline to more typical levels.''
   Last fall prices soared because ``unusual heat and pest problems
reduced yields,'' the report said. In November and December,
lettuce sold for $20 to $25 per carton at California shipping
points, compared with $4 to $7 a year earlier. As of early
February, prices were ranging between $3 and $12.
   ``Prices remained higher than usual during the winter because
cold weather and plant disease transmitted by the whitefly reduced
midwinter shipments from the Imperial Valley,'' the report said.
``The valley usually supplies most of the domestic lettuce supply
during midwinter.''

   The recent death of Donald L. Houston, one of
the Agriculture Department's senior career officials, was a tragic
loss to the department and to the nation, Agriculture Secretary
Richard E. Lyng said.
   Houston, 53, died Feb. 19 of cancer. He was named head of the
department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service last fall
and previously was administrator of the Food Safety and Inspection
Service for seven years.
   Lyng said Tuesday in a statement that he had known Houston, a
veterinarian, for more than 15 years. ``He truly epitomized what
the American people want and expect in a public servant,'' Lyng
said.
   Houston was born in East St. Louis, Ill., where he joined USDA
as a veterinary meat inspector in 1961. He moved to Washington in
1965.

<HEAD>Comments On Aid To Ireland Cause Dustup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department's second-ranking official
caused a diplomatic and political dustup last week with his
explanation, later partially disavowed, of why the administration
wants to shut down its aid program for Ireland.
   The remarks by Deputy Secretary John Whitehead generated a stir
in Dublin, sent Irish diplomats scurrying to find explanations, and
produced expressions of dismay from the ``Shamrock caucus'' in
Congress.
   In the end, the State Department took the unusual step of
issuing a clarification that effectively repudiated part of what
Whitehead said.
   At issue is U.S. participation in the International Fund for
Ireland. American contributions have totaled $85 million over the
past two years, and $35 million is slated for the current year.
Most of the money is aimed at promoting economic and social
progress in Northern Ireland, now approaching two decades of
sectarian strife.
   Last Thursday, Whitehead went before reporters to explain the
administration's foreign aid proposals for 1989, and he was asked
why no money was programmed for Ireland.
   He said Ireland ``ranks down the list'' of foreign aid
priorities, adding that the United States does not get a ``real
return'' on its investment despite the emotional and ``maybe
political appeal'' of aid to Ireland.
   ``Other needs appear to us to be more urgent,'' Whitehead said.
   Both the cutoff decision and the tone of Whitehead's remarks
were the talk of Dublin late last week. And there were expressions
of concern from two of the best known Irish-Americans in Congress _
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and his nephew, Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II,
both Massachusetts Democrats.
   The chairman of the congressional Friends of Ireland, Rep. Brian
Donnelly, D-Mass., said he was outraged.
   The State Department came under pressure to clarify Whitehead's
remarks, and did so over the weekend. Privately, one official said
that Whitehead misspoke but the problem was ``how to set the record
straight'' without upsetting him.
   After a day's contemplation, the State Department issued a
statement expressing strong support for the International Fund even
though Whitehead had said U.S. contributions to it had yielded few
benefits.
   Distancing itself still further from Whitehead, the statement
said, ``We have been very happy with the progress which the Fund
and its governing board have made.''
   Beyond that, it even implied that the administration would not
be displeased if Congress overrode the aid cutoff and earmarked
more money for the program.
   ``Of course, we will be ultimately guided by what Congress
authorizes and appropriates and what is signed into law by the
president,'' the statement said.
   There is some dispute as to whether U.S. participation in the
program was to be phased out. Whitehead made no reference to any
such limit, but the State Department clarification does allude to a
three-year time frame. Irish diplomatic sources, meanwhile, said
funding for additional years had never been ruled out.
   In any case, the statement appears to have calmed Dublin, where
there is a feeling that the Congress won't cut the aid program
adrift.
   Contributing to the more relaxed mood was the statement by Rep.
Kennedy: ``The Fund has done good work and continues to do so,'' he
said. ``I for one will be encouraging my colleagues to consider the
economic and symbolic importance of continued American support for
the International Fund.''

   Kansas Sen. Bob Dole, proclaiming ``we're
winning again,'' was heading South hopeful his victories in
Minnesota and South Dakota would help his Republican presidential
campaign in a region where Vice President George Bush is the
front-runner.
   ``I've got a big hill to climb in the South,'' Dole said Tuesday
night while celebrating his latest victories.
   Dole scheduled four stops in South Carolina, one in North
Carolina and then planned to head for Florida.
   The Kansas senator got some help in South Carolina on Monday
when he was endorsed by Sen. Strom Thurmond, the state's senior
officeholder. But Bush has the backing of Gov. Carroll Campbell.
   With a Republican primary on March 5, South Carolina opens the
Southern phase of the 1988 campaign. Three days later is Super
Tuesday, when 20 states, the majority of them in the South, will
hold primaries or caucuses.
   For the second time this busy campaign month, Dole was heading
out of the Midwest with a decisive show of support.
   Two weeks ago, he won the Iowa caucuses and flew to New
Hampshire hoping to deliver a killing blow to Bush. But New England
proved to be Bush territory and the vice president won the New
Hampshire primary and revived his status as GOP front-runner.
   Dole was in a black mood after his New Hampshire defeat, but
upon getting strong backing from voters in South Dakota and
Minnesota, the senator said, ``It's a lot more fun winning.''
   As for Bush's showing _ second in South Dakota and fourth in
Minnesota _ Dole said, ``I really believe when the vice president
of the United States gets 10 percent, or around that area _ the
sitting vice president _ and only about 15 percent in South Dakota,
it's going to send a strong signal to small towns, to farmers, to
businessmen and businesswomen.''
   ``We're winning again,'' he said. ``We probably had our
expectations too high in New Hampshire and it probably hurt us some
around the country. But now we're winning again.''
   Dole said he hoped the results ``send a message that Bob Dole
has a message. That's what the election is all about. I haven't
changed my message. I've talked about the future, I've talked about
leadership, I've talked about party responsibilities, I've talked
about the left out and the down-and-out in America, I've talked
about the future of our young people.''

   The returns from South Dakota's
presidential primary election were complete _ except for Lincoln
No. 51, a rural precinct near Lemmon in extreme northwestern South
Dakota.
   Fern Brockel, Perkins County auditor, said election workers in
the precinct were supposed to fill in the vote totals for each
candidate on the unofficial return sheet. But she said it was given
to her with all the lines blank.
   The returns are in the official poll book, but under the rules,
it cannot be opened until the official canvass this afternoon.
   Without the missing precinct, Perkins County residents cast
1,345 votes out of the nearly 165,000 votes cast in the election.

   Five radical students armed with bombs
and knives seized a U.S. Information Service office today and
detonated two bombs and started a fire before police overpowered
them.
   Two of the students brandishing explosive devices and draped in
South Korean flags stood at shattered windows on the second floor
yelling ``Yankee go home'' as riot police ringed the building.
   U.S. Embassy officials said they had no reports of injuries, but
the attackers smashed windows and set a fire in a periodical
storage room. Thick smoke filled part of the building located in
the heart of Seoul.
   People inside the building at the time of the attack, including
at least one American, were not detained by the radicals.
   The students, who said they were members of the ``Young Student
Suicide Group'' claimed they had 18 bombs and screamed at
surrounding police to stay away. They tossed down a statement
charging the United States was attempting to make South Korea a
colony.
   ``Yankees stay out of Korea,'' the students yelled.
   A police officer said it was unclear how many of the explosive
devices the attackers had. The bombs were crude chemical devices,
possibly some kind of plastic explosive, he said.
   About 200 radical students hurling firebombs and rocks clashed
with riot police about an hour later outside Myungdong Cathedral.
Police fired volleys of tear gas at the students who yelled slogans
denouncing President-elect Roh Tae-woo, who is to be sworn in
Thursday.
   Hundreds of protesters had gathered at the cathedral less than a
mile from the U.S. Information Service office earlier in the
afternoon for an anti-government protest. ``Down with Roh
Tae-woo,'' the students yelled.
   Some of the attackers were reading in the office's library when
there was a large explosion in a nearby roon and they suddenly
pulled out bombs and started screaming slogans, eyewitnesses said.
At least one of the attackers pulled out a knife and brandished it,
they said.
   ``He was kind of crazy-eyed,'' said Paul Wadden, a visiting
American teacher who was reading in the library at the time.
   The attackers smashed three windows overlooking the main street
outside and two of them stood shouting slogans out into the street
and brandishing bombs and cigaretee lighters. Riot police stood on
the sidewalk below with shields covering their heads and shattered
glass covered the street.
   The students tossed at least one bomb into the street where it
exploded harmlessly, eyewitnesses said. A second bomb was tossed
out, but did not explode, they said.
   People caught in the library said the students did not attempt
to detain them and they were able to leave after recovering from
their initial shock. Wadden said he and other people were prevented
from leaving downstairs for up to 10 minutes by building guards.
   There were about 40 people in the library at the time, most of
them Koreans, eyewitnesses said.
   Police who entered the building by the rear entrance overpowered
the protesters about 30 minutes after the attack began. The
students were taken out of the building in a bus with covered
windows.
   U.S. Embassy officials said South Korean riot police entered the
building at their request.
   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita arrived at the Lotte
Hotel across the street from the U.S. Information Service office
just as the incident ended, officials said. Takeshita is in Seoul
for Roh's inauguration.
   American diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
they did not know why the students attacked the U.S. facility. ``We
have no idea what the motivation was,'' an embassy official said.
   The United States is South Korea's chief ally. Washington has
40,000 troops in South Korea under a mutual defense pact against
communist North Korea.
   The U.S. Information Service provides reading material and other
materials on the United States and operates libraries and
information centers around the world in conjunction with American
embassies. The service office in Seoul is located about half a mile
from the American Embassy.
   The same office was seized by 73 radical students for four days
in May, 1985 as an anti-American protest. They ended the occupation
peacefully and some later received prison sentences.
   U.S. Embassy officials were unable to explain today how the
attackers were able to bring weapons into the well-guarded
building. Visitors must pass a metal detector, present
identification and have their bags searched and there are police
guards inside and outside.
   The statement by the students denounced Roh as a puppet who had
been installed by the United States.
   South Korean radicals have repeatedly charged the United States
has kept a series of authoritarian governments in power in South
Korea. Roh, a former general, won the first democratic elections in
16 years last December.

   A retired lawyer who reads dictionaries for
fun says too many people are put off by big words.
   Because so many people suffer from sesquipedalophobia, a fear or
hatred of big words, 80-year-old Norman Schur has written eight
books on the subject.
   ``This has gone from a hobby with me to a vocation and finally
to a matter of sociological and political concern,'' Schur said
Tuesday.
   Schur has just published his latest book, ``1000 Most
Challenging Words.'' In the next one, ``1000 Most Obscure Words,''
he plans brief essays on each word's origins and meaning. He
believes if a person becomes familiar with a word, he or she will
use it.
   Schur, who received his high school diploma at age 11 and
graduated from Harvard University at age 17, does not blame weak
vocabularies on the educational system.
   ``There are some well-educated people who do not like you to use
big words,'' he said. ``If you use a word that's unfamiliar to them
they resent it and this intimidates a lot of people.''
   For people who want to improve their vocabulary, Schur suggests
they jot down every new word in a notebook, master it and then use
it.
   ``I find reading dictionaries fascinating, but that's not the
menu for most people,'' he said.

   Grammy Goose met Granny Goose in
court, but the legal fight is not a family feud.
   Granny Goose Foods Inc., the nation's third largest potato chip
manufacturer, has accused Grammy Goose Baby Boutique in nearby
Petaluma of creating confusion over the food firm's name and logo
by using a similar name.
   Granny has asked for a preliminary injunction against Grammy.
   The name and logo ``represent the most valuable asset my client
owns,'' Granny attorney Kate Spellman told Sonoma County Superior
Court Judge Lloyd von der Mehden on Tuesday. ``Where there is
confusion, dilution has occurred.''
   Sandy Gotelli, the Petaluma grandmother who owns the baby shop,
said she'll be forced out of business if the injunction is granted.
She said she picked the name by combining her liking for geese with
her granddaughter's nickname for her.
   Ms. Spellman said the company offered to help Grammy Goose
design a new sign, phase out printed paper goods and find a new
name that retains part of the current name.
   ``We understand she is a small business and we would like to
mitigate the harm to her,'' Ms. Spellman said. ``We mean her no
harm; she is so inflexible.''
   Mrs. Gotelli's attorney said the shop owner had made a counter
offer to the chip maker: to promise the Grammy Goose name would
never be sold to anyone else and would never be used outside of
Sonoma County.
   The judge gave Mrs. Gotelli one week to respond in writing to
the Granny Goose offer. Granny Goose's attorneys then will have
five days to respond.
   The judge said he would then issue a ruling.

<HEAD>Three Candidates Could Lose Matching Funds Eligibility</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Elections Rdp Bjt</HEAD>

   Three presidential candidates faced the
prospect of losing future federal matching funds after failing to
win at least 10 percent of the vote in the South Dakota primary.
   Democrats Jesse Jackson, Albert Gore Jr. and Gary Hart were in
jeopardy of losing their eligibility under an election-law
stipulation that starts the clock on dropping a candidate from the
matching-funds category if he receives less than 10 percent in two
successive primaries.
   In South Dakota, Gore had 8 percent and Hart and Jackson each
had 5 percent. All three also finished in the single digits in New
Hampshire last week, in the first primary of the campaign season.
   Failing to get 10 percent in South Dakota does not mean an
immediate cutoff because the law stays such action for 30 days
after the primary. And candidates can qualify anew by getting 20
percent of the vote in a future primary.
   That means Jackson and Gore, who are expected to do well in the
Super Tuesday primaries on March 8, are likely to score the strong
finishes they need before the 30-day stay expires.
   In 1984, Jackson lost his eligiblity because he fell below the
10 percent threshhold in Nebraska and Oregon. But before the money
was actually stopped, he had regained certification by winning 23.6
percent in New Jersey.
   Regardless of whether candidates have been disqualified from
receiving matching funds to continue their campaigns, they can
continue to receive matching payments to retire campaign debts that
were incurred before the date of ineligibility, said spokesman Fred
Eiland of the Federal Election Commission.
   Matching funds from the federal Treasury have become the manna
of presidential campaigns, with the amount distributed to each
candidate dependent on how much he raises privately.
   The Federal Election Commission so far this year has handed out
close to $40 million to 14 candidates. Three of those candidates
have already dropped out of the race _ Democrat Bruce Babbitt and
Republicans Alexander Haig and Pete du Pont.
   The fund matches each contribution of $250 or less that a
candidate raises privately. The fund is supported by the $1
checkoff on individual income tax forms under the public financing
system set up in the mid-1970s by Congress.
   The six-member Federal Election Commission votes on candidate
certification following a review of the campaign's finances by the
FEC audit and legal staff.
   To be certified, a candidate must raise $100,000 across 20
states in contributions of $250 or less.
   Vice President George Bush and Robertson have received the most
matching funds for this year's election, each with more than $6.5
million.
   Jackson has received $621,828, Gore nearly $2 million, and Hart
$1.1 million.
   At a recent FEC meeting, commissioner Joan Aikens attacked what
she described as an inequity in the law that allows an unopposed
third-party candidate, or a candidate who chooses not to compete in
every state, to continue receiving federal matching funds while
others who place their names on every primary ballot face the risk
of cutoff.
   A candidate whose name is not on the ballot is not covered by
the 10 percent rule.

was applauded by residents in Linshu County, one of the poorest in
the coastal province of Shandong.
   It said she was angry at the county Communist Party secretary,
who together with other officials last December gathered for a
meeting which in actuality was a 14-dish banquet.
   The party said county officials were already under fire for
investing $378,000 to build a guest house for VIPs and budgeting
$59,000 for banquets last year at the county government guesthouse.
   China's State Council, or Cabinet, last year ordered all party
and government officials to cut back on banqueting and gift-giving.

   A judge committed suicide today by jumping from the
16th floor of a high-rise building housing court offices in Tokyo,
police said.
   An official of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department
identified the man as Akira Takayama, 55, a judge at the Tokyo High
Court.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said police
were investigating the reason for the suicide.
   According to an official of the Tokyo High Court's public
relations division, Takayama had been suffering from depression
since last year.
   Takayama, a native of Tokyo, was appointed to the Tokyo High
Court in April 1986 following service with several local courts,
the court official said.

   The death toll in a monthlong
outbreak of whooping cough reached 12 with the death of an infant
girl, health authorities said.
   The 2-year-old girl died Friday in the Maria Ludovica Children's
Hospital in Buenos Aires despite a campaign by public health
authorities to innoculate children in the Buenos Aires-La Plata
area.
   Whooping cough normally is not a common health risk in Argentina.
   Officials have noted each of 12 fatalities were malnourished,
came from low-income families and had not been innoculated against
whooping cough.

   The artist, Louis Denis Armand the elder, who worked at the
Vincennes factory near Paris, painted 46 patches of enamel colors
on the bowl to guide him in selecting colors, which often changed

   Some colors were also very expensive. One pound of one color

   The bowl, 1} inches high, was bought and sold anonymously on

   Taiwan residents made nearly 90,000 trips to
China in 1987, an official report said. It was a huge increase from
the previous year and was brought about by Taiwan's lifting of a
ban on such travel.
   China's domestic China News Service, in a report appearing in
Hong Kong today, said ``Taiwan compatriots'' traveled to the
Chinese mainland more than 89,000 times last year, a 180 percent
increase from 1986. The statistics were provided by a Public
Security Bureau spokesman, the report said.
   The Nationalist Chinese government on Taiwan in October lifted a
38-year old ban on travel to mainland China to allow family
reunions. Thousands of Taiwan residents secretly traveled to China
before the ban was lifted.

   A couple who claimed they were waging a
holy war have been sentenced in the latest of three slayings in
which they regarded the victims as witches or vampires.
   Michael Carson was sentenced to prison for 27 years to life in
the 1982 slaying of Clark Stephens near Garberville. His wife,
Suzan, was sentenced to 25 years to life.
   The sentences will follow earlier terms, Deputy District
Attorney Max Cardoza said Tuesday. The Carsons were convicted in
May of shooting Stephens, 26, and burning his body before burying
it.
   Carson, 36, was given an additional two years for using a
firearm. The two were sentenced Monday by Humboldt County Superior
Court Judge William Ferroggiaro.
   The Carsons previously were given consecutive sentences of 25
years to life for two other slayings.
   They were convicted in the 1981 murder in San Francisco of a
woman Mrs. Carson told investigators was a ``psychic vampire'' who
was draining her of her beauty.
   They also were convicted of the 1983 killing of a man in Sonoma
County who picked up the hitchhiking couple, only to be declared a
witch by the wife.
   In a lengthy statement taped by police, the two said they were
on a holy war ordered by Allah.
   Defense attorneys contended Carson shot Stephens to death
because he had sexually attacked Mrs. Carson, an action that
amounted to self-defense in keeping with the couple's beliefs as
fundamentalist Moslems.

   Eric Sevareid says news on television ``has
become part of the daily entertainment of a rather bored society.''
   The former chief Washington correspondent of CBS News, at a
seminar Tuesday at the Museum of Broadcasting, expressed misgivings
about the rise of features-oriented TV magazine shows.
   ``Underlying this whole development in the way news is presented
now is ... the nature and psychology of American society at this
moment in history (after) years of essential peace and essential
prosperity for most people.
   ``We have news about entertainment now; you're going to have a
news magazine on the business side of sports; you have a game
called `Trivial Pursuit.'''
   Audiences don't get very excited about policy issues and don't
want to follow what appears to be 30 years of the same pictures
coming from the Middle East, he said.
   ``If you had another great war or great depression, that would
change matters, but that would be too high a price,'' Sevareid said.
   Sevareid also said he watched ``with some astonishment'' the
on-air battle between CBS anchorman Dan Rather and Vice President
George Bush.
   ``I'd never seen brother Dan lose his cool before,'' Sevareid
said. ``I'm sorry it happened. I don't think a CBS hard news show
should become controverted. ... Neutrality should be preserved.
   ``I don't think Mr. Bush answered much,'' he added.

   Former Miss America Bess Myerson, who was
indicted last year for conspiring to influence the judge in the
divorce settlement of her boyfriend, has been called to testify in
a hearing today over a property dispute between the estranged
couple.
   Nancy Capasso sought the hearing after her ex-husband, Carl
``Andy'' Capasso, allegedly removed property from the house she had
won as part of the divorce settlement, said Raoul Felder, Mrs.
Capasso's attorney.
   Felder said that he had subpoenaed the 63-year-old Miss Myerson,
a former city cultural affairs commissioner, and characterized her
as ``a key witness'' in the proceeding in state Supreme Court in
Manhattan.
   Miss Myerson stayed in the Long Island house last summer after
Capasso went to jail in June after being convicted of tax evasion
in an unrelated case.
   Mrs. Capasso, who won the house as part of her $6.4 million
divorce settlement, seeks to have Capasso held in contempt, Felder
said.
   Felder said he could not elaborate on details because a gag
order was in effect.
   Mrs. Capasso has said all the living room furniture was taken,
some artwork, a collection of antique quilts, some decoy ducks and
sets of china and flatware.
   Miss Myerson was indicted last October for allegedly attempting
to influence the rulings of former state Supreme Court Justice
Hortense Gabel in the Capassos' divorce by giving the judge's
daughter, Sukreet Gabel, a city job.
   Miss Myerson, Capasso and Mrs. Gabel have pleaded innocent to
five counts each of federal conspiracy, mail fraud and
bribe-related charges. They each face up to five years in prison,
if convicted. Miss Myerson faces an additional five years if
convicted of obstruction of justice.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union will start
removing its shorter-range nuclear missiles from Czechoslovakia in
the next few days, the Communist Party daily newspaper Rude Pravo
said today.
   Also today, East Germany said the Soviets will begin the early
withdrawal of its shorter-range missiles from the Communist German
nation this week.
   The missiles in both countries are included in an arms control
agreement signed by the United States and the Soviet Union last
December in Washington under which all intermediate-range nuclear
weapons in Europe will be scrapped.
   The Rude Pravo newspaper stressed that the missiles are being
taken out of Czechoslovakia before the treaty is ratified by the
U.S. Congress.
   Word that Soviet missiles will be removed from Czechoslovakia
coincided with national celebrations of the 40th anniversary of the
Communist takeover in Prague. The planned removal of the missiles
was described by Rude Pravo as a significant gesture by the Kremlin.
   ``A further expression of good will, similar to (others) made by
the Soviet Union ... is that according to an agreement with
Czechoslovakia and East Germany, it will begin in the next few days
to pull out from the territory of both states the missile units
equipped with OTR-22 missiles,'' Rude Pravo said. OTR-22 is the
Warsaw Pact name for the shorter-range missiles NATO calls SS-12.
Czechoslovakia has never said how many Soviet missiles were
installed on its territory. The only location ever given for the
weapons was a military base near Hranice, 180 miles southeast of
Prague.
   In 1983, NATO began installing U.S. cruise and Pershing 2
missiles in Western Europe to counteract Soviet missiles pointed at
the West. The Kremlin responded by moving some SS-12 missiles from
their bases in the Soviet Union to East Germany and Czechoslovakia,
to put them within striking range of the West.
   Meanwhile, the East German Mission in Bonn said today in a brief
statement: ``Withdrawal of the Soviet shorter-range missiles from
the German Democratic Republic will begin'' Thursday. The statement
said missiles would be removed that day from two East German sites
_ Bischofswerda and Waren.
   East Germany announced last week that SS-12s had been
dismantled, put into crates and were ready for transport back to
the Soviet Union. But it did not announced until today when the
missiles would be taken out of the country.
   East German leader Erich Honecker in January indicated that
Soviet nuclear missiles in Europe could be removed ahead of
schedule.
   According to figures released after the superpower arms treaty
was signed, there are 54 SS-12s in East Germany.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed In Dull Trading, Gold Also Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed in dull European trading
today as dealers waited for new factors to get the market out of
the doldrums.
   Gold prices fell in London following a large sell order from the
Middle East, which had a big impact because the market was so thin,
dealers said.
   Traders said last Friday's remark by Swiss National Bank
President Pierre Languetin that the dollar was poised to move lower
again had put a very tight lid on any upward movement of the U.S.
currency.
   Dealers said Tuesday's congressional testimony in Washington by
U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan failed to give the
market new directions and they didn't expect his repeat performance
for the Senate Banking Committee today to have much more impact.
   The release later today of fourth-quarter U.S. trade figures
isn't likely to have a major impact on the market either because
the figures are already known, dealers said.
   ``I honestly don't know what could help the dollar move,'' said
one senior trader in Milan. But another dealer said Thursday's
report of the first revision of U.S. fourth-quarter gross domestic
product growth could possibly have an effect on the dollar.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends as Europe's begins, the
dollar rose 0.25 yen to a closing 128.75. Later, in London, it was
quoted slightly higher at 128.85 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
rates:
   _1.69225 West German marks, down from 1.6945
   _1.3905 Swiss francs, up from 1.3895
   _5.72675 French francs, up from 5.7240
   _1.89775 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9000
   _1,247.00 Italian lire, up from 1.246.60
   _1.2673 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2712
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7665 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.7655 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $441.70 a troy ounce and
at midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a lower
recommended price of $438. Both were down from late Tuesday's bid
of $442.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $438.50, down from $442 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.60 to close at a bid $444.20.
   Silver also fell in London where the bid price was $6.28 a troy
ounce at midmorning today compared with late Tuesday's $6.33.

   A bus driver was arrested after allegedly beating
a passenger who boarded his bus without exact change, police said.
   The name of the driver, a 43-year-old Detroit man, was withheld
pending issuance of a warrant on a charge of felonious assault,
city police Lt. Philip Foster said Tuesday.
   Jonathan Perkins, 30, of Detroit boarded the Detroit Department
of Transportation bus about 9:15 a.m. Monday without the proper
change, police said.
   ``The driver was absolutely belligerent,'' an unidentified bus
rider told the Detroit Free Press.
   Perkins placed some coins in the fare box, then asked other
passengers for change for a $20 bill to pay the balance of the $1
fare, the rider said.
   The driver yelled at Perkins for about a mile, then shoved him
off the bus, the passenger said.
   ``He literally threw him on the ground, pulled a knife on him
and the next thing I know, he's on the guy's face,'' the passenger
said. ``He started kicking him in the head and then shoved him into
the intersection and left the scene.''
   Perkins was treated at Detroit Receiving Hospital for minor
bruises and cuts, police said.
   A woman who answered the phone at the Department of
Transportation office said Robert Polk, director of the agency, was
not available for comment Tuesday.

Speeding</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Panamanian police detained more than
two dozen U.S. servicemen without charges after the son-in-law of
Panama's military strongman was held for speeding at a U.S.
military installation.
   Two U.S. military personnel were stopped and briefly held
Tuesday, a Pentagon official said in Washington. On Monday,
Panamanian police detained 25 U.S. servicemen for two hours before
releasing them without filing charges, said a U.S. Embassy
spokesman in Panama City.
   The servicemen were picked up while driving to U.S. military
installations inside the former Panama Canal Zone.
   The State Department planned to protest the detentions, said the
Pentagon official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The official said the detentions came a day after Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega's son-in-law was stopped in the canal zone. He
declined to give the son-in-law's name, but said Noriega's daughter
and two other passengers were in the car when it was stopped Sunday
night for speeding and passing in a no-passing zone at the Albrook
Air Force Station, outside of Panama City.
   The son-in-law allegedly became abusive with the Air Force
security policeman who stopped him. He could not produce
identification, the source said. At that point, the policeman
``restrained'' him, put him in handcuffs and took him to the Air
Force police station for processing, the source said. The
son-in-law was released about an hour after being stopped, he said.
   On Monday, the U.S. Embassy spokesman told The Associated Press
police stopped 25 servicemen. The spokesman, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said most were driving motorcycles to installations
inside the former canal zone, but two were driving cars and one was
walking.
   Col. Leonidas Macias, chief of police for the Panamanian Defense
Forces, denied police detained the servicemen. He said officers
merely stopped them to check for drivers' licenses and remind them
that U.S. personnel are forbidden to wear uniforms outside of the
former canal zone.
   The detentions marked the latest sign of deteriorating relations
between the United States and Panama since last June, when
demonstrations broke out in Panama demanding the resignation of
Noriega, the armed forces chief.
   The Reagan administration has publicly called for Noriega to
step down following his indictment on drug trafficking charges this
month by a federal grand jury in Miami.

<HEAD>Coastal Commission Approves Exxon Platforms Off Santa Barbara
County</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The California Coastal Commission has
approved a $2.5 billion plan for three offshore oil platforms in
the Santa Barbara Channel, a plan first proposed by Exxon in 1981.
   On an 8-2 vote, with one commissioner abstaining, the commission
approved Exxon's plans for the platforms, a marine terminal and
onshore facility in Las Flores Canyon.
   But the plan, which would more than double the state's oil
production, requires major changes in Exxon's production methods.
The company must dismantle an offshore treatment and storage ship
now in use, commission spokesman Jack Liebster said Tuesday.
   ``We're talking about state-of-the-art air pollution control to
reduce the current levels,'' he said. ``Even with the expansion,
this will result in a reduction of emissions.''
   A 1987 agreement on air pollution controls was instrumental in
breaking a political deadlock over Exxon's plan, commission
Chairman Michael Wornum said.
   The company is producing up to 40,000 barrels a day on Platform
Hondo, located between coastal Santa Barbara County and the Channel
Islands. It processes the oil on an offshore vessel, a converted
oil tanker moored in federal waters 3.1 miles offshore.
   In 1984 the oil company sued the commission, and later sued
Santa Barbara County, over its demands that Exxon stop using the
converted tanker. In 1986 it renewed its lawsuit and issued an
appeal to the Interior Department.
   Commission approval was the result of compromises reached on all
sides, including environmentalists, who agreed with Tuesday's
decision, said Ralph Faust, another commission spokesman.
   Following the vote, Terry C. Leftgoff, spokesman for the
environmental group Get Oil Out, said the Exxon project is ``the
best that we could hope for in a regulatory environment.''

<HEAD>Rights Group: Death Squad Activity Increasing In Honduras</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honduran death squads linked to the military have
stepped up their campaign of terror, targeting opposition leaders,
human rights activists, students and peasants, Amnesty
International said today.
   ``Serious human rights violations, including arbitrary arrests,
torture and ill-treatment are widespread in Honduras and show no
signs of diminishing,'' the London-based human rights organization
said in a report.
   The group said many of the abuses arose during strikes, disputes
over farm land or army operations against leftist guerrillas. The
group also said it remains concerned about the government's failure
to investigate reports of more than 100 people who disappeared
between 1980 and 1984.
   In the report, titled ``Honduras: Civilian Authority, Military
Power,'' Amnesty based its findings on interviews with senior
government and military officials and non-government sources during
two visits to Honduras last year.
   The group said recent abuses include bombings, arbitrary
detentions, death threats and harassment of critics of the
government of President Jose Azcona Hoyo. Despite a civilian
government, the 17,500-man army wields great power.
   Victims include human rights figures, opposition leaders,
members of labor organizations, students and peasants, Amnesty
said. The victims described severe beatings, electric shocks and
sexual abuse.
   The group said patterns of abuse changed since the early 1980s,
when it said abductions and executions were carried out
systematically by order of the armed forces.
   The alleged abuses fell off after 1984, but the death squads
have apparently begun a new campaign of intimidation in the last
two years, the report said. Death squads were believed to have been
involved in three killings last month, it said.
   Two people shot to death in January were to have testified
against the government in a human rights case before the
Inter-American Court of Human Rights in Costa Rica.
   Amnesty blamed most of the recent alleged human rights abuses on
the National Investigations Division, which Amnesty said is part of
the police but actually is controlled by the military.
   The report quoted a former member of Battalion 3-16, which it
said was a secret military intelligence unit, as saying he and
other members of the group were secretly trained by the U.S.
military in 1981.
   The unidentified man was quoted as saying that the U.S.
officials discouraged torture but had trained the unit in methods
of physical coercion.
   Since 1981, the Reagan administration has made Honduras a key
ally for policy aimed at containing the leftist Sandinista
government in neighboring Nicaragua.
   A series of joint military exercises have been held, almost
continously, for the past five years. A permanent American military
presence is maintained at Palmerola Air Base near Tegucigalpa and
at other facilities, totaling more than 1,000 U.S. troops.
   The U.S. military aid program grew from $8.9 million in 1981 to
$88.8 million for 1986.

   A tugboat captain was wounded early today when
shots fired from the Brooklyn shoreline shattered the cabin's glass
windshield, police said.
   More than a dozen such shootings have occurred since 2,800 union
tugboat and barge workers went on strike over wage cuts Feb. 16,
said an officer from the Police Department's Harbor Unit who
declined to give his name.
   Early today, the tugboat Odin was headed south in the East
River, just off Newtown Creek, when a gunman fired four shots.
Newton Creek divides Brooklyn and Queens.
   Capt. Les Wallin suffered cuts on the left side of his face and
glass in his eye when the windshield broke, but refused medical aid
when the tugboat docked at Staten Island, the officer said.
   The captain and non-union crew members declined to discuss the
shooting, police said.
   No other details were immediately available.

<HEAD>Mofford Could Be Drafted in Recall Without Resigning, Corbin Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Acting Gov. Rose Mofford may be able to
run for governor in a May 17 recall election without giving up her
position as secretary of state, the state's attorney general said.
   Attorney General Bob Corbin, in a non-binding opinion issued
Tuesday, said that if Mrs. Mofford is drafted instead of declaring
herself a candidate, she would not have to resign as secretary of
state.
   Mrs. Mofford, who became acting governor following the
impeachment of Gov. Evan Mecham on Feb. 5, has not said whether she
is interested in running, and had no comment Tuesday on the
possibility of a draft.
   As governor, Mecham would automatically be on the recall ballot,
but his status is clouded by his impeachment and impending trial
before the Senate, and a criminal trial scheduled for March.
   Democrat Carolyn Warner, who lost to Mecham in a three-way race
in 1968, and Republican John Rhodes have indicated they will be
candidates in the recall election.
   Mecham, a Republican, faces a Senate trial Monday on charges
that he hid a $350,000 campaign loan, misused $80,000 from the
governor's protocol fund by loaning it to his auto dealership, and
tried to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat by a
state official.
   A criminal trial is scheduled for March 22 on felony charges of
concealing the $350,000 loan.
   Arizona's resign-to-run law requires officeholders who run for
another position to resign unless they are in the last year of
their current term.
   Rep. Cindy Resnick, a Democrat, had asked Corbin whether a draft
of an officeholder as a gubernatorial candidate would require that
person to resign.
   Ms. Resnick said she expects a draft-Mofford movement to be
started, but said she did not plan to be involved.
   Meanwhile, Rhodes announced Tuesday that former Sen. Barry
Goldwater would be his honorary campaign chairman. Goldwater
endorsed Mecham in the 1986 campaign, but now says that was a
mistake.
   In accepting the position, Goldwater said: ``You look back over
all the governors that we've had in this state. We've had some darn
good ones and we've had some mediocre ones, but it took us a long
time to get a really bad one.''

<HEAD>Celebrated Concert Pianist Solomon Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The concert pianist Solomon, hailed as one of the
century's most distinguished pianists but forced to cut short his
career because of a stroke, has died at age 85, his family said.
   Solomon, born Solomon Cutner but known professionally by his
first name only, died Feb. 2, his family announced Tuesday. No
cause of death was given.
   Solomon was born Aug. 9, 1902, one of seven children in a family
in London's rough East End. At age 7 he began studying music. One
of his fellow students became the Queen Mother, mother of Queen
Elizabeth II.
   Solomon made his concert hall debut when he was 8 years old,
playing playing Mozart's B flat Concerto and the slow movement of
Tchaikovsky's First Concerto at the Queen's Hall in London.
   He later appeared again at the Queen's Hall, under conductor Sir
Henry Wood, playing Beethoven's Third Concerto and Liszt's
Hungarian Fantasy, and in 1911 undertook his first British tour.
The same year he played to the royal family at Buckingham Palace,
and his career as a child prodigy was established.
   Solomon appeared with many of the world's most famous conductors
and orchestras, but by the time he was 16, he had tired of the
concert hall circuit and temporarily quit to resume his musical
studies.
   Wood wrote in his autobiography that the young Solomon told him
he had ``no boy's interests, no games,'' because of his career.
   ``As he said, it had been piano, piano, and nothing but piano,''
wrote Wood.
   Solomon resumed his concert hall career in 1921, made his
American debut in 1926, and was one of the world's most
sought-after pianists until suffering a debilitating stroke in 1956.
   The Times of London wrote: ``He developed his technical
virtuosity to the highest pitch, but his outstanding quality was
the intellectual insight and poetry of feeling which he brought to
the keyboard repertory, from Mozart to Debussy.''
   Another London paper, The Daily Telegraph, wrote: ``Solomon's
clarity of articulation, his warm, soft-grained tone, musical
accuracy and honesty of purpose shone through all his performances,
and his virtuosity was so formidable as to be unnoticeable.''
   Solomon is survived by his wife, Gwendoline Byrne, who was one
of his former pupils.

   Retired Maj. Gen. Harry M. Arthur, who spent
two years as the ranking American officer with the Chinese Army
during World War II, has died. He was 88.
   Arthur, also a prominent Upstate banker, died Tuesday in Wallace
Thomson Hospital.
   A 1921 graduate of The Citadel, Arthur was called to active duty
during World War II, where he served in the Chinese Combat Command,
rising to the rank of colonel.
   After his release from active duty, he organized the 218th
Infantry Regiment and was its commander until 1952, when he was
promoted to brigadier general and took command of the 51st Division
Artillery.
   Arthur, who retired as a major general in 1959, was president
and chairman of Arthur State Bank, which he and his family founded
in 1933. He also was a former president of the American Bankers
Association and South Carolina Bankers Association and state
commander of the American Legion.
   He was survived by his wife, daughter and three grandchildren.

   Apple Computer Inc. is developing a
laptop computer which it hopes to introduce next year, according to
a computer magazine which printed details of the secret project.
   The article in this week's edition of Macintosh Today details
the size, appearance and technical specifications of Apple's Laguna
laptop model. The San Francisco Examiner reported Tuesday that the
article was based on a confidential document given to a free-lance
writer by an Apple employee.
   ``We don't comment on rumors of products which may or may not
come to market,'' said Barbara Krause, spokeswoman for Apple
Computer Inc.
   The magazine article describes a 12-pound laptop with a
flat-panel monitor called an active matrix screen and a central
processor that can run Macintosh software using only a fraction of
the power used by most desktop models.
   The magazine said the system will come with 1 megabyte of
internal memory, the same as the Macintosh SE. It will be powered
by a five-pound lead-acid battery that will last up to 10 hours
before recharging.
   The Laguna is not expected to join the $1 billion laptop market
until next year.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Roh Tae-woo will be
sworn in Thursday in the first peaceful transfer of power in South
Korea's turbulent history with a promise to end authoritarian rule
and usher in full democracy.
   Roh will take the oath of office as the 6th president at a
heavily-guarded ceremony at the National Assembly with no general
public participation. Outgoing President Chun Doo-hwan and other
leaders will attend the ceremony.
   The inauguration also will mark the start of the Sixth Republic
as the country adopts a new constitution that provides for greater
political and individiual freedoms. Roh has promised the republic
will be ``the great era of the common man.''
   The charismatic Roh, 55, is committed to ending the nation's
long tradition of authoritarian rule that strictly limited
political activity and ruthlessly cracked down on opposition. He
also has pledged to end the country's confrontational politics and
violent regional divisions and to redress social and economic
inequality.
   Roh on Monday called for a government that ``is loved by the
people and run in accordance with democratic principles to suit a
new era.''
   The new president faces the challenge of ending authoritarian
rule in a nation that has never had a peaceful transfer of power.
The nation has been dominated by civilian and military strongmen
since its creation in 1948 and its politics are turbulent and often
violent.
   Police were on alert in Seoul and other cities today after
reports that radical students and dissidents may attempt to stage
anti-Roh protests. Radical groups have refused to recognize Roh's
election and contend he is intent on continuing authoritarian rule.
   Radical groups called for anti-government protests in Seoul and
other cities today and Thursday. Detachments of riot police were
seen guarding key points in some areas of Seoul and police
officials said reserves were on alert.
   More than 200 student and dissident leaders were being watched
in case they attempted to organize protests, officials said. Police
also were guarding festive arches erected in Seoul for the
inauguration in case dissidents attempted to wreck them.
   Chun warned at a farewell dinner in Seoul tonight that political
stability and continued expansion were vital. He warned against
political unrest.
   ``I am convinced that there must not, and will not, be any
repeat of political chaos that imperils the country or social chaos
that threatens national survival,'' he said.
   Chun, who took power with military backing in 1980 when he and
Roh were senior generals, is to head a presidential advisory board.
He was to leave office in a separate ceremony Thursday.
   A low-key inaugural ceremony was planned for Thursday with Roh
scheduled to take the oath of office in the square in front of the
National Assembly building. But attendance was by invitation only
and there were no plans for celebrations or public attendance.
   Factory workers, street cleaners and other ordinary people were
invited to attend the ceremony along with officials, academics, and
other representatives of Korean society, officials said.
   Envoys from 88 nations, including Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita of Japan and the premiers of Sri Lanka and Fiji, were to
attend the inauguration. The United States was to be represented by
Treasury Secretary James Baker.
   Roh won the country's first democratic presidential election in
16 years on Dec. 16 with 36.6 percent of the vote. He defeated
rival opposition candidates Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung, who
split the opposition vote.
   Roh, a former general, is identified with the military-backed
governments that have ruled the country since 1961 and many Koreans
are doubtful if he can achieve massive democratic change.
   Opposition parties contend Roh's inauguration will simply signal
a change of figurehead and the government will continue to be run
by the armed forces and an entrenched elite of government officials
and business leaders.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of leftist demonstrators
marched on a military camp today and accused the government of
betraying the revolution that swept President Corazon Aquino to
power two years ago.
   About 200 policemen blocked the road leading to Camp Crame as
helicopters patrolled overhead. But the crowd, estimated at 20,000
people by police, was peaceful.
   The rally was held on a boulevard between Camp Crame and Camp
Aguinaldo. Two years ago, hundreds of thousands of Filipinos
flocked there and prevented troops loyal to then-President
Ferdinand Marcos from attacking rebellious soldiers holed up in
Crame. The four-day standoff ended with Marcos' depature from the
Philippines.
   Today's marchers included students, workers, farmers, nuns and
priests. They chanted ``dismantle the U.S.-Aquino regime'' and
carried effigies of Mrs. Aquino and Uncle Sam.
   Red banners said, ``Advance the People's Genuine Revolution,''
and one poster read: ``Cory _ Closet Dictator.''
   The protesters denounced what they said was Mrs. Aquino's
failure to put in place the sweeping economic and political reforms
she had promised during the 1986 presidential election.
   ``We had high hopes when Cory Aquino said she would be the exact
opposite of Marcos. But after two years, we have no more hope that
she will fulfill her promises,'' Crispin Beltran, head of the
militant May 1st Movement labor organization, told the rally.
   Some of the protesters distributed leaflets of the outlawed
National Democratic Front, an umbrella organization of 12 Marxist
groups, including the Communist Party of the Philippines and its
armed wing, the New People's Army.
   ``The Aquino government has betrayed the Filipino people's hope
for fundamental changes in society after ousting Marcos...,'' a
leaflet said. It accused the government of incompetence and
``subservience to the U.S.''
   The crowd dispersed without incident after about three hours.
   U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt, however, congratulated the
Aquino government today on molding a democratic government.
   ``What we have seen happen in this period is impressive,'' Platt
said in a statement. ``A constitution has been written and ratified
by an overwhelming margin... A new congress has been freely elected
and is vigorously functioning. Local elections have been held in
every province, city and town throughout the Philippine Archipelago.
   ``In these and mnay other ways democracy has been restored in
the Philippines,'' he said.
   In other developments, Mrs. Aquino defended her embattled
defense secretary, Gen. Fidel Ramos, and credited him with blocking
attempts by renegade military officers to topple her government.
   She said ``as far as I'm concerned, General (Fidel) Ramos has
proven himself not only now but in the past, especially in his
abiding by the constitution. He has not been any part of any coup
attempt.''
   Mrs. Aquino made the remark to reporters one day after the wife
of a Navy captain linked to at least two coup attempts and the
assassination of a leftist labor leader hinted that Ramos was
involved in a November 1986 conspiracy.
   Ramos said that he, in fact, exposed the coup attempt.

   An unusually well-preserved fossil
skull stumbled upon by a graduate student belongs to one of the
smallest baleen whales ever known, scientists said.
   The skull and other parts of the 15-foot whale, believed to be
12 million to 14 million years old and possibly related to modern
toothless whales, were found embedded in a sandstone bluff on Ano
Nuevo Island, about 19 miles northwest of Santa Cruz.
   The 35-pound skull is a ``beautiful specimen,'' said Kenneth S.
Norris, a professor of natural history at the University of
California-Santa Cruz.
   ``(It's) one of the best I know of,'' Norris, a world authority
on whales, said at a news conference Tuesday.
   Brian Fadley, 26, a UC-Santa Cruz graduate student, said he
spotted the skull as an irregularity in a rock formation last May
while visiting Ano Nuevo Island with a group studying elephant
seals. A closer look revealed that it was a whale skull.
   ``Since I didn't have the usual tools of a paleontologist, I
modified a rusty pipe to excavate the fossil,'' Fadley said.
   Norris said it was unusual to find a cetacean skull with the
delicate earbones intact. Those tiny bones could help researchers
learn how whales and other marine mammals developed their
exceptionally acute hearing, he said.
   The animal itself, 15 feet long and weighing 1,500 pounds,
apparently was an adult pygmy baleen whale ``with close linkage to
the modern California gray whale,'' Norris said. California grays
can be as long as 40 feet long and weigh 40 tons.
   Baleen whales, which include the 100-foot blue whale, have no
teeth but eat by filtering plankton and tiny crustaceans from
seawater with bristly baleen plates attached to their upper jaw.

<TEXT>
   An 18-year-old British soldier
was charged today with unlawfully killing an unarmed Roman Catholic
civilian in a case that has further strained tense Anglo-Irish
relations.
   The soldier, David Jonathan Holden, appeared at Cookstown
Magistrates Court, 25 miles west of Belfast, as British and Irish
leaders met across the border in Dublin to discuss the
deterioration in relations.
   In addition to the Holden case, tensions have increased because
of the disclosure Tuesday that another British soldier jailed for
murdering an unarmed Roman Catholic civilian was freed on parole
after serving three years.
   Magistrate Robert Porter ordered Holden held in police custody
until a court appearance in Belfast on March 9. The defense said it
would appeal to the High Court for bail to be set.
   Holden's attorney said the soldier will plead innocent to the
charge of unlawfully killing Aidan McAnespie, 23, an election
worker for Sinn Fein, the legal political arm of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army.
   The British Army said McAnespie was killed Sunday by a
ricocheting bullet after a machine gun was fired accidentally from
an army observation post at a checkpoint near Aughnacloy, half a
mile from the border in County Tyrone.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Tuesday rebuked Irish Prime
Minister Charles Haughey's government for ordering its own
investigation into the shooting. British officials said they
already were investigating.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King paid a courtesy call on
Haughey in Dublin before he joined Irish Foreign Minister Brian
Lenihan and Justice Minister Gerry Collins today for a meeting of
the Anglo-Irish conference.
   The main item on the agenda was proposed British legislation
aimed at guaranteeing a fair division of employment between Roman
Catholics and Protestants in Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland.
   Before entering the meeting, King said: ``We will be talking
about all matters of concern to us both and we shall be having very
frank and valuable discussions. This is the value of the
Anglo-Irish Agreement. It means we can meet to discuss very
difficult issues.''
   The Anglo-Irish Agreement, signed in November 1985, gives the
Irish government a consultative role in the running of Northern
Ireland.
   The conference was set up as a forum for Irish and British
ministers to discuss problems in the province, where the IRA is
fighting to end British rule.
   On Tuesday, security forces ringed Aughnacloy for McAnespie's
funeral.
   Cardinal Tomas O Fiaich, Roman Catholic primate of Ireland who
broke off a trip to San Francisco to attend the funeral, told the
congregation McAnespie had been murdered. McAnespie was buried
across the border in the Irish Republic.
   O Fiaich said he has never hesitated to condemn IRA killings as
murder, adding: ``How can I now avoid using this term `murder' to
describe the killing in broad daylight of one of the best known and
most highly respected men in this parish?''
   Anglo-Irish relations have been severely strained recently by a
series of disputes, principally Britain's refusal after a long
inquiry to prosecute Northern Ireland policemen who shot and killed
six unarmed Catholics in 1982.
   News that a British soldier sentenced to life in prison for
murdering an unarmed Roman Catholic civilian, Thomas Reilly, 22, in
Belfast in 1983 was freed on parole after serving only three years
has added to that tension.
   The British Army in a statement Tuesday confirmed Irish news
reports that Pvt. Ian Richard Thain, who was jailed for murdering
Reilly during rioting in Belfast on Aug. 9, 1983, had been freed on
parole in February 1987.
   Thain, 21, said at his trial he thought Reilly, road manager of
the pop group Bananarama, was reaching for a gun, but the judge
dismissed his claim.
   Upon hearing of Thain's release, Reilly's father, James Reilly,
said: ``It is unbelievable. People talk about British justice but
where is it today? Our son was never involved in anything. He was
murdered.''

   Eleven men were given prison terms ranging from
three years to life for killing two giant pandas, the official
Xinhua News Agency said today.
   The report said a court in northwest Sichuan province, one of
the last natural habitats of the endangered species, found the men
guilty in two separate incidents of killing the pandas and selling
their pelts.
   It did not say how many of the men were given life terms.
   In December, another court in Sichuan sentenced 26 men to prison
terms ranging from two years to life for killing six pandas and
selling their skins.
   Only about 1,000 giant pandas still survive in the wild, all in
Sichuan and neighboring southwest China provinces.
   Although the Chinese government has banned panda hunting, the
pandas' numbers are believed to have decreased as a result of their
low fertility rate, a shortage of the wild bamboo on which they
feed and human predators.

   The meter has expired on penny parking
in this western Massachusetts town, where selectmen voted to
eliminate one-cent meters on two downtown streets to raise more
money.
   Selectmen voted Tuesday to boost the parking rates on Main and
Federal streets, the two busiest streets in the downtown commercial
district, to five cents for 15 minutes, 10 cents for 30 minutes and
20 cents for an hour. Motorists will still be able to park on side
streets for a penny and a nickel.
   The new meter heads will also have quarter slots, but 25 cents
will still get you only an hour's parking, selectman Joseph Laurie
said.
   An advisory committee urged the town in January to boost the
rates, maintaining it was costing the town of 19,100 people more to
collect the pennies than it was getting in meter revenue.
   The new meters, which officials said should be installed in
about two months, are expected to generate an additional $36,000 in
revenue annually. The town now gets about $70,000 from its parking
meters.

   Programs aimed at helping California's
preschool children resist sexual abuse are ineffective and should
be phased out, a federally funded study said.
   The programs are beyond the understanding of such young
children, may frighten them away from normal affection and unjustly
make them responsible for the behavior of others, researchers said
Tuesday.
   ``The central idea of training the children bears rethinking,''
said Neil Gilbert, professor of social welfare at the University of
California at Berkeley.
   ``We should not make 4-year-olds responsible for defending
themselves,'' said Gilbert, who conducted the two-year study for
UC-Berkeley's Family Welfare Research Group.
   Programs that try to train preschool children to recognize and
resist sexual abuse reach 42,000 younsters throughout the state.
   The study of 118 preschoolers in seven counties found that
attempts to teach very young children the difference between a
``good touch'' and a ``bad touch'' may confuse them.
   Defining a ``bad touch'' as anything that ``feels bad'' results
in children resisting any contact they do not like at the moment,
such as Grandma's ``yucky'' kiss, Uncle Ed's scratchy cheek and the
tight hug from a well-meaning relative, Gilbert said.
   ``Thus, in the most inclusive view of `bad touch,' children are
taught that virtually a pat on the head could be cause for
reporting to the authorities,'' the report said.
   The report also said responsibility for protecting children lies
with adults and not with the youngsters themselves.
   Teaching 4-year-olds they must ``take charge to control the
outside world ... is an abdication of family and social
responsibility'' and a ``sorry message of these times,''
researchers said.
   However, teaching parents alone will not make children safe from
sexual abuse, said Pnina Tobin, executive director of the San
Francisco-based Children's Self-Help Project, one of the programs
studied.
   ``It does no good just to (educate) the adults around the
child,'' she said. ``What if that adult is the offender? The child
is not protected. They must know there are others they can talk
to.''

   A man who stole a courthouse bailiff's gold
bracelet left behind a clue to his identity _ his subpoena in a
theft case.
   Police say Miguel Garcia approached a bailiff at an information
booth in the Dade County Courthouse to explain he could not show up
at a Thursday hearing on a theft case because he had a conflicting
court date on another theft charge.
   As the bailiff, Elisa Yepe, leaned over to examine the subpoena,
her $525 gold bracelet fell to the floor.
   Garcia picked it up and ran, leaving behind his subpoena, police
said.
   ``One minute he's asking her for a new trial date, the next
minute he pulls this,'' Metro-Dade officer Rick Conover said
Monday. ``Either this guy has guts or he's not wrapped too tight.''
   Police hope to arrest Garcia when he shows up for one of his
Thursday court dates.

<TEXT>
   A sorority formed by lesbians has been
officially recognized by UCLA, reportedly the first such
recognition extended by any U.S. university.
   The decision allows the nine-member Lambda Delta Lambda to meet
on campus and apply for student funds, but university rules forbid
exclusion of heterosexual members.
   ``It was very validating for us,'' sorority president Allison
Adler said of last week's recognition by the Office of Fraternity
and Sorority Relations at the University of California, Los Angeles.
   Although other social and political organizations for homosexual
students exist at UCLA and other campuses, gay activists said they
knew of no other gay-oriented sorority or fraternity that has
formal approval from an American college or university to be part
of a regulated Greek letter system.
   ``I think it's fantastic,'' said Vernon Strickland, a leader of
the Washington, D.C.-based gay fraternity Delta Lambda Phi. ``I
think that means the gentlemen will have no problems getting
recognition.''
   Delta Lambda Phi is trying to organize chapters at UCLA and four
other universities. Its Washington chapter isn't affiliated with
any school.
   ``I never felt any sentimental attachment to UCLA before. But I
now feel proud to be a student here,'' Lambda Delta Lambda member
Julie Leverence said this week. ``Lambda Delta Lambda gives me a
supportive atmosphere and a connection to the school.''
   All nine women members said they are lesbians and said they feel
excluded at existing sororities.
   ``We are not starting this sorority so we can meet new people to
sleep with,'' Marci Kay said. ``We are starting it because we feel
excluded from the Greek system now, and that is a network system
for friendship and professional careers.''
   Lambda Delta Lambda is planning ways to raise money and attract
new members, and it is also considering applying for membership in
the Panhellenic Council, which coordinates many inter-sorority
events.
   ``We don't just want to be separate but equal,'' Adler said.
``We want to be equal.''

<TEXT>
   The chief Cuban delegate to the U.N. Human Rights
Commission today accused the chief U.S. delegate, a former Cuban
political prisoner, of lying about his 22 years in custody.
   Raul Roa Kouri, Cuba's deputy foreign minister, called a news
conference to answer the allegations of Armando Valladares, who
said he was tortured and temporarily crippled while imprisoned in
Cuba.
   ``He was never beaten, he was never tortured,'' Roa said. ``This
doesn't happen in Cuba.'' He said he called the press conference
because ``the credibility of the commission is at stake.''
   Roa distributed copies of documents that included a purported
confidential U.S. State Department memo on Valladares and Cuban
arguments against points made in the memo.
   Valladares, named late last year to head the U.S. delegation to
the 43-nation Human Rights Commission, has been a U.S. citizen
since January 1987. In January 1961, Valladares was sentenced to 30
years in prison in Cuba. He was freed after 22 years following the
intervention of President Francois Mitterrand of France.
   Valladares gained international attention during his
incarceration by writing poetry that he managed to smuggle out of
prison.
   In a book he wrote about his prison years, titled ``Against All
Hope,'' Valladares says he was arrested and jailed because he
voiced his opposition to communism under Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
   Roa said, ``The book is full of lies, and it is boring.''
   Roa repeated Cuban allegations that Valladares was jailed
because he belonged to a group that was planning terrorist
activities to overthrow the government.
   He read from what he said was the record of Valladares' trial,
saying Valladares was convicted of ``planning to take up arms with
the purpose of overthrowing through violent means the powers of the
state.''
   The State Department says Valladares was not charged with
terrorism at his trial and that such allegations only arose later.
   Roa alleged that Valladares had been a police officer under the
government of dictator Fulgencio Batista, who was ousted in 1959 by
Castro loyalists, but he said Valladares was never penalized for
this. He denied that the Cubans had charged Valladares belonged to
Batista's secret police.
   However, a reproduction of an article in the French newspaper Le
Monde in 1983, included in the package of documents distributed by
the Cuban delegation, quotes Castro as saying Valladares was a
member of the ``Gestapo of Batista.'' A U.S. spokesman, Bill
Lawrence, said Roa was ``lying'' when he said Valladares had been a
policeman.
   ``They keep altering their story every year, trying to make it
more acceptable,'' he told The Associated Press. He said Cuba had
also at one time accused Valladares of being a torturer but that
the country now denies having said that.

   With one lucky rifle shot, a young man troubled
by a compulsion to take four-hour showers and wash his hands up to
50 times a day cured his affliction.
   The man, identified as George, failed in a suicide attempt, but
the .22-caliber bullet he fired into his mouth lodged in the lower
part of his brain's left frontal lobe, a region believed related to
so-called obsessive-compulsive disorder.
   ``If it had gone to the center, it would have killed him,'' his
psychiatrist, Leslie Solyom, said Tuesday. ``If it had gone to the
right, it would have had no effect.''
   Victims of obsessive-compulsive disorder, like George, suffer
from extreme hesitation and doubtfulness, Solyom said. ``They
hesitate so much that after closing the door they are not really
certain they closed the door, so they have to go back again and
again.''
   George was nearly 18 when he fired the bullet into his brain.
``He was found lying on his face, blood oozing from his nostrils,''
said Solyom, who practices at Shaughnessy Hospital in Vancouver,
British Columbia.
   George recovered from the shooting in three weeks. ``We started
on behavior therapy,'' Solyom said. ``But he was no longer
obsessive.''
   It was the only change that Solyom could find.
   ``His I.Q. did not change. There was no change personality-wise.
He did not become an automaton. His symptoms are gone,'' Solyom
said.
   Before the suicide attempt, George washed his hands as often as
50 times a day. He would take four-hour showers, and would check
and re-check to see whether doors and windows were locked and
whether he had enough money in his wallet.
   When he pulled the trigger, George may have in effect given
himself a lobotomy.
   Or, more precisely, a leukotomy _ a severing of the links
between the frontal lobes and other parts of the brain, rather than
a removal of brain tissue as in a lobotomy.
   ``In the '40s and '50s, psychosurgeons would get these patients
and have reasonably good results cutting the pathway between the
front part of the brain and a part called the striatum,'' said Dr.
Thomas Insel, a psychiatrist at the National Institute of Mental
Health in Bethesda, Md. Such surgery has fallen out of favor as
effective drugs have been found.
   Insel, who has specialized in this disorder, said sophisticated
brain images called PET scans show that the frontal lobes are more
active in obsessive-compulsive patients than in normal people. That
suggests that the source of the disorder lies at least partly in
the frontal lobes, he said.
   Solyom reported George's case in the December issue of the
British Journal of Psychiatry. A short report of that study appears
this week in a newsletter for doctors called Physician's Weekly,
which describes the suicide attempt as ``successful radical
surgery.''
   Solyom said George was goaded into the suicide attempt several
years ago by his mother. ``She said, `So look George, if your life
is so wretched, just go and shoot yourself,''' Solyom said.
   Dr. Judith Rapoport, also of the National Institute of Mental
Health, said that George's accident is reminiscent of the incident
early in this century that led to the discovery of the frontal
lobotomy.
   A Massachusetts railroad worker named Phineas Gage suffered an
accident in which a piece of a crowbar became lodged in his head,
she said. The crowbar was removed. ``Amazingly he survived,'' she
said.
   ``In those days, the risk of infection was high. What was
remarkable was his personality change. He became a happy-go-lucky
bum who sang for his supper and wandered. And somebody studied
this.'' Gage had had the first lobotomy.

   Some 20,000 customers have asked Southwestern Bell
Telephone to block access to 976 phone numbers, including 8,000 who
called Bell in one day requesting the free service.
   The 976 system has drawn criticism from parents and citizen
groups because some 976 lines offer sexually explicit messages. In
some cases, children have made numerous calls to the services,
racking up large phone bills for their parents. Businesses also
face problems with employees making calls and billing the company.
   Eight thousand calls were received Tuesday, the first day
Southwestern Bell offered to block access to Dial 976 for free,
company spokesman Dave Lopez said. The other calls were made before
Bell began running notices in local newspapers, he said.
   The 20,000 requests represent less than 1 percent of the 3.5
million phone lines in four cities where 976 service is availble _
Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston and San Antonio, Lopez said.
   The Public Service Commission authorized Bell to block the calls
for free last week following hearings in Austin.

<HEAD>Panel's Chairman Urges $2 Billion in New Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of President Reagan's AIDS
commission called today for spending an additional $2 billion to
fight the disease among drug abusers.
   Retired Navy Adm. James D. Watkins proposed that half of the
money should be in federal funds with the rest coming from state
and local sources.
   The additional $1 billion in federal spending called for in the
chairman's recommendations to the full 13-member commission would
nearly double the total $1.3 billion Reagan requested for all AIDS
education and research in the budget he submitted last week.
   But Watkins told reporters only 15 percent of the nation's
estimated 1.3 million intravenous drug abusers are in treatment
plans, with long waiting lists in many cities for people seeking
help in kicking drugs.
   ``Anyone crying for help should get help on demand,'' Watkins
said.
   Moreover, he said, the sharply higher spending on drug treatment
must be a ``sustained emphasis. You cannot just throw in some money
one year and drop it out next year.''
   Although male homosexuals still make up the largest percentage
of people with AIDS, health officials have determined that the
disease is spreading most rapidly now among intravenous drug
abusers and their sexual partners.
   Watkins' recommendations go to the full commission for action
Monday; the panel expects to present an interim report to the
president the following week.
   The former chief of naval operations acknowledged that his
recommendation for sharply higher spending on drug treatment
programs might spark controversy by opening the way for criticism
of the administration for not doing more in that area.
   But he expessed confidence the full commission would adopt that
and most of his other recommendations for an interim report and
said, ``It is not in our charter to worry about the political
impact.''
   Asked his reaction to the likelihood that presidential
candidates, particularly Democrats, would use his recommendations
to ``zing the White House,'' Watkins replied:
   ``How do you avoid politicizing something in an election year.
If they all adopt this and say `Let's get on with it,' that's the
kind of politization I like.''
   Watkins' proposal on drug treatment calls specifically for
adding 32,000 drug abuse treatment specialists and said 3,300 new
treatment facilities may have to be added.
   In other areas, Watkins called for more financial support for
the Food and Drug Administration to double the number of scientists
reviewing AIDS-related products and a program of direct grants to
community-based drug testing programs.
   He also made a number of recommendations in the health care
area, including more training for doctors.
   ``Many physicians are severely lacking in knowledge about AIDS
and there are signs that medical schools have not yet built up a
curriculum to educate doctors about AIDS treatment,'' Watkins said.
   The interim report will not include any recommendations on the
controversial areas of AIDS testing, discrimination against people
testing positive for the virus and other social and legal aspects.
   To try to adopt recommendations in those areas would result in
the commission's being ``at loggerheads with ourselves'' at this
time.
   But he said hearings on those topics are scheduled next month in
Nashville and promised the panel would not shy away from addressing
them in its final report June 24.

   A woman apparently kidnapped a
5-week-old baby because she had an abortion recently, authorities
said after they returned the infant to her ecstatic mother.
   Maritza Rentz, a 38-year-old psychotherapist arrested Tuesday,
was being held today on $8,000 bond for investigation of
second-degree kidnapping in the abduction of 5-week-old Rachael Ann
White, police said.
   Rachael Ann was found at Mrs. Rentz' home a day after the girl's
mother issued a nationwide plea for the baby's safe return.
   Rachael Ann had been kidnapped from her home Friday by a woman
answering a babysitting ad, police said.
   ``It appears it was a replacement baby,'' said police Lt. Joe
Vernier.
   Mrs. Rentz gave a statement to police saying she told her
husband when he came home from work Friday that she had had a baby
that day by Caesarian section, said police Capt. Vic Morris.
   Investigators said they did not know how long Mrs. Rentz was
pregnant when the abortion was performed on Oct. 27 for medical
reasons. Details were sketchy, but apparently doctors decided she
couldn't bring the baby to term, police said.
   Police also have not determined whether Air Force Capt. Paul
Rentz was aware his wife's pregnancy was terminated.
   Rentz, a 36-year-old clinical psychologist and behavioral
science instructor at the Air Force Academy, was being questioned,
authorities said.
   Rachael Ann's mother, Cora Abbott, was elated after being
reunited with her baby.
   ``I thought I loved her all I could until this happened, but now
I know I love her even more,'' said Abbott, who was at work at a
pizza parlor when the abduction occurred.
   Of Mrs. Rentz, she said: ``I feel very sorry for her, that she'd
have to do something like this. But I'm angry. I still don't
understand it.''
   The woman who kidnapped the baby matched Mrs. Rentz's
description ``like a mirror,'' said Deputy Police Chief Pat
McElderry.
   The woman was applying for a babysitting position at the home of
Rachael's Ann's grandmother, Ethel Reed. Reed gave the child to the
woman while she went to answer the telephone; when she returned,
the woman had fled with the child, authorities said.
   A tip led police to the Rentzes, Morris said. Air Force Maj.
Bruce Yeager, a neighbor in the subdivision where the Rentzes moved
last summer, said he became suspicous after he and his wife saw the
baby and thought it did not look newborn. He said he contacted Air
Force Academy police.
   Investigators went to the home Tuesday as Rentz was leaving for
work in a car that matched a description of the car police were
seeking in the abduction, authorities said.
   Police found the baby in a crib and were shown a false birth
certificate with ``Penrose Hospital'' handwritten on a gold seal,
police said.
   But after an FBI agent looked at the child's navel and noticed
the umbilical cord knot was gone _ an indication the baby was older
than four days _ Mrs. Rentz was arrested, authorities said.
   Mrs. Rentz came into her office at about 9 a.m. Friday, but
stayed only about 30 minutes, said receptionist Meda Frye.
   According to police documents, friends were told Mrs. Rentz had
given birth at 9:42 that morning. She said her baby was named
Aurora Helen Rentz.
   On Oct. 31, shortly after she lost her own baby, Mrs. Rentz put
an ad in a newspaper offering her services as a counselor. Her
business cards referred to her as a psychotherapist offering
``parent-child consultations,'' said the Colorado Springs Gazette
Telegraph.
   A month later, on Dec. 1, she set up a family counseling
practice, the newspaper said.
   Dr. John McDonald, a University of Colorado criminal
psychiatrist, said women who kidnap babies often have lost a child
of their own.
   ``The need to have a baby is so great, they don't really face up
to what they are doing, or they convince themselves that what they
are doing is right,'' he said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A claim that fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear
accident may have caused deaths in the United States is highly
unlikely and based on an erroneous statistical analysis, scientists
say.
   A researcher, Jay Gould, said he found an unexplained jump in
the nation's deaths in the months following the Chernobyl accident.
   However, the amount of radiation that reached the United States
is so small that the notion is ``not credible,'' Harvard radiation
expert Edward Webster said Tuesday.
   Webster, who serves on a United Nations committee studying
health effects of Chernobyl, called the hypothesis ``a mechanism
which most knowledgeable radiobiologists would throw out because of
the very low doses involved.''
   A federal health statistics official says no mysterious increase
in deaths occurred.
   Gould said he will present his work Thursday at a meeting on
radiation and the immune system in West Germany.
   Gould, a fellow of the Institute for Policy Studies in
Washington, says federal statistics show an unexplained jump of
maybe 20,000 to 40,000 deaths in the nation for May through August
of 1986, following the Soviet accident in April.
   Radioactive fallout from Chernobyl is ``the only explanation
we've been able to develop,'' Gould said in a recent interview.
   The hypothesis, which he stressed was not proven, is that
fallout reaching the United States encouraged formation of ``free
radicals,'' chemically reactive molecules that can damage cells.
These molecules, the hypothesis continues, may have weakened the
immune systems of some people enough to make them vulnerable to
fatal diseases.
   Gould said slightly more than 33 percent of all 1986 deaths
occurred in May through August, up from the average of about 32
percent for the three prior years and the highest percentage since
1900.
   Increases appeared among people older than 65 and those who
suffered from infectious diseases, including pneumonia, he said.
   The study also looked at peak concentrations of iodine-131, a
radioactive component of fallout, reported in milk during the
summer of 1986. Gould said that among the nation's nine census
regions, higher concentrations were associated with greater
increases in mortality for the summer of 1986 compared to the
previous summer.
   The study's data on deaths came from the National Center for
Health Statistics. But Harry Rosenberg, chief of the center's
mortality statistics branch, said Tuesday his analysis found no
inexplicable jump in deaths.
   ``We didn't see anything that departs from the historic
pattern,'' he said.
   ``His numbers are not consistent with the numbers that are
adjusted to represent the United States as a whole.''
   Rosenberg also said 1986 had the lowest death rate ever recorded
for the nation, when the population's changing age composition is
taken into account.
   Neal Nelson, a radiation biologist for the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, said he was skeptical of the Chernobyl
hypothesis after starting to study information Gould sent him.
   The maximum dose of Chernobyl radiation in the United States was
only about 1 percent of the normal background exposure, he said.
   People eat radioactive material constantly, from natural and
man-made sources, so ``there is nothing unique'' about swallowing
the tiny amounts of radioactive iodine from Chernobyl fallout, he
said.

<HEAD>Court Expand Communities' Power to Impose Rent Controls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today expanded the power of
communities to impose rent controls, ruling that hardships to
tenants may be considered when landlords seek rent increases.
   By a 6-2 vote, the justices upheld a San Jose, Calif., ordinance
that has been attacked as a ``Robin Hood'' law that steals from the
rich to pay the poor.
   While some 200 cities nationwide have rent control laws, the San
Jose hardship provision appears to be unique. Landlord groups have
said other communities now may adopt similar laws.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, in his opinion for the
court, said landlords failed to prove that the ordinance deprived
them of the value of their property without just compensation.
   He rejected the landlords' claim that the city unlawfully is
seeking to alleviate hardships for tenants by imposing financial
burdens on the property owners.
   ``We have long recognized that a legitimate and rational goal of
price or rate regulation is the protection of consumer welfare,''
Rehnquist said. The ordinance ``represents a rational attempt to
accommodate the conflicting interests of protecting tenants from
burdensome rent increases while at the same time ensuring that
landlords are guaranteed a fair return of their investment.''
   Today's decision does not rule out all challenges to such
oridinances. But Rehnquist said to win their case landlords at
least must show actual losses suffered because communities lowered
rents to lessen tenants' hardships.
   There was no such evidence in the San Jose case, Rehnquist said.
   Rehnquist also noted that rent controls are based on the idea
that without them housing shortages would permit landlords to gouge
renters.
   The impact of the San Jose ordinance has been muted, at least
temporarily, because vacancy rates have been around 8 percent with
the downturn in the local high-technology economy. That has made it
less likely that landlords, concerned about losing tenants, will
increase rents sufficiently to prompt challenges based on hardship.
   Justices Antonin Scalia and Sandra Day O'Connor dissented today.
   Scalia, writing for both, said the tenant hardship provision
takes private property without just compensation in violation of
the Constitution.
   Scalia denounced ``the unfairness of making one citizen pay, in
some fashion other than taxes, to remedy a social problem that is
none of his creation.''
   The San Jose law generally permits annual rent increases of 8
percent on residential property. But if the landlord seeks more
than that, it opens the way for challenge by ``hardship'' tenants
who are defined as earning less than 80 percent of the median
income for the area.
   The landlords said that means individuals making $34,000 a year
can qualify as hardship cases.
   The ordinance, passed in 1979, provides a hearing before a city
officer to determine if a challenged rent increase is too great.
   The increase can be rolled back even below 8 percent for
hardship tenants if the hearing officer decides a smaller increase
is justified. The landlord still would receive an increase of 5
percent plus enough to cover capital improvements and increased
rehabilitation, maintenance and other costs.
   No landlord in San Jose alleged that the law actually has been
implemented to deprive owners of their property's full value.
   Landlords challenged the law's constitutionality shortly after
it was adopted. They said the ordinance, in effect, is a Robin Hood
statute that requires them to assume the public burden of
subsidizing low-income tenants.
   The California Supreme Court, reversing rulings by lower courts,
upheld the ordinance by a 4-3 vote in 1986.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the U.S. Supreme Court
last Thursday, did not take part in today's decision.
   The case is Pennell vs. San Jose, 86-753

<HEAD>Government Urged To Apologize For 1980 Actions At Kwangju</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A civic panel recommending policy
guidelines to the president called on the government to apologize
for the military's bloody suppression of a civil uprising in the
city of Kwangju, members said today.
   The Committee for the Promotion of Democracy and National
Reconciliation also said the government should compensate victims
of the 1980 revolt, said panel members.
   By official count, at least 191 people were killed and more than
800 were wounded in the nine-day uprising in the southern city of
Kwangju. Dissident sources say the casualty figure was much higher.
   President-elect Roh Tae-woo set up the 56-member committee after
winning the Dec. 16 presidential elections, saying he needed
``policy guidelines'' reflecting the opinions of broad sections of
the society.
   The committee called on the Roh government, to be inaugurated
Thursday, to make an open apology for the Kwangju incident and
compensate its victims.
   The committee also urged Roh to declare a human rights charter
in a bid to show his determination to support civil rights.
   The committee said a government apology is needed because harsh
military suppression was partly blamed for the anti-government
uprising, the worst in modern Korean history.
   The Kwangju incident is a touchy political issue involving Roh
and his predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, who seized power with military
backing in 1980. They are known to have played a key part in the
military suppression of the uprising.
   The United States has also been criticized for its alleged part
in the military suppression of the Kwangju uprising. Government
critics have alleged that the top U.S. commander in Seoul permitted
some South Korean army units under his operational control to help
crush the Kwangju revolt.
   The United States has denied the allegations.

   The theft of a transcript of grand jury
testimony won't compromise the investigation of the alleged rape
and kidnapping of a black teen-ager, state Attorney General Robert
Abrams said.
   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said Tuesday that
a former employee of Abrams' office had been arrested and charged
with stealing and disclosing a transcript of testimony taken before
the Dutchess County grand jury investigating the attack on Tawana
Brawley.
   Abrams was appointed by Gov. Mario Cuomo as a special prosecutor
to investigate the case.
   Miss Brawley, 16, was found on Nov. 28 in Wappingers Falls after
having disappeared for four days. She was wrapped in a plastic
garbage bag and covered with feces, with ``KKK'' and ``nigger''
scrawled on her body.
   On the advice of her attorneys, she has not cooperated with
investigators since shortly after the attack.
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, one of Miss Brawley's representatives,
said the alleged theft of the grand jury transcript ``underscores
the ineptness and incompetence that we've been talking about.''
Sharpton said he spoke for attorneys Alton Maddox Jr. and C. Vernon
Mason, who are advising the Brawley family.
   Abrams said the arrest will not affect the investigation, which
continues Monday when a special state grand jury is to be empaneled
in Poughkeepsie.
   Samuel Evans, 49, was employed as the senior printing machine
operator in Abrams' office until his resignation on Feb. 5. He
allegedly stole the Brawley transcript before he left the job.
   Evans, of New York City, surrendered to the district attorney's
office on Tuesday.
   According to Morgenthau, Evans gave the transcript to an
unidentified person on Feb. 18. That person notified the district
attorney's office.
   Evans is charged with fourth-degree grand larceny, which carries
a maximum penalty of four years in prison upon conviction.
   The material did not go beyond Evans and the informant, and no
other document relating to the case was stolen, Abrams said.

   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz
will visit Damascus for several hours Saturday as part of a tour of
Middle East capitals to promote Arab-Israeli peace, a Syrian source
said today.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Shultz
will fly to Damascus around noon and depart in the evening. Shultz
will be accompanied by Richard Murphy, his assistant on Middle
Eastern affairs, the source said. He gave no other details.
   U.S. officials said Friday in Washington that Shultz probably
would visit Syria, the Soviet Union's main Arab ally, during his
Middle East tour. Shultz was scheduled to leave Washington late
today for visits to Israel, Jordan and Egypt.
   The U.S. officials said the purpose of the Damascus visit would
be to discuss the U.S. drive for Arab-Israeli negotiations with
President Hafez Assad, whose support for any long-term settlement
in the Middle East is considered essential by specialists at the
State Department's Near East Bureau.
   A visit by Shultz would be a major boost to Syria and would mark
an improvement in its relations with the United States. Syria is
one of six countries on the State Department's list of states
supporting terrorism.
   President Reagan imposed sanctions against Syria in November
1986, after Britain severed diplomatic relations with Damascus
following Syria's implication in an attempt to blow up an Israeli
airliner in London.
   U.S.-Syrian relations began improving last year, when the United
States sent its ambassador back to Damascus.
   Last week, one of the U.S. sanctions against Syria was lifted.
State Department deputy spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said that
security clearance requirements on Syrian applicants for U.S. visas
have been lifted. Under the sanctions, all such applicants were
subjected to lengthy checks to qualify for a visa.

   A triumphant Bob Dole headed for Southern
campaign territory today with two Republican Midwest victories in
hand, proclaiming ``it's a lot more fun winning.'' George Bush
dismissed his losses, saying ``You can't win them all.''
   Dole racked up solid victories in Minnesota's presidential
caucuses and South Dakota's primary while Bush finished third in
South Dakota and last in Minnesota.
   In Portland, Maine, Bush said his poor showings were ``somewhat
anticipated.''
   ``You can't go everywhere,'' he told reporters. ``... You can't
win them all.''
   Jack Kemp, with dismal finishes in both states, took solace in
Bush's equally poor showings.
   ``I think last night proved the race is wide open. That's all I
really needed,'' Kemp said in Beaufort, S.C. ``I needed to break up
the idea that this is a Bush-Dole race.''
   Dole was campaigning today in South Carolina, which holds its
primary March 5, three days before the 20-state Super Tuesday
contest.
   A week ago, Dole lost the New Hampshire primary to Bush. A week
before that, Bush lost the Iowa caucuses to Dole, finishing behind
former television evangelist Pat Robertson.
   Robertson, who ran second to Dole in Minnesota and South Dakota,
said he was ``simply delighted'' with his showing in South Dakota.
But he conceded he had hoped for a victory in Minnesota, where he
built a strong organization.
   ``This helps me enormously as I go into the Super Tuesday
states,'' Robertson said today in Atlanta. ``I am very pleased with
what I'm seeing. I believe that coming out of Super Tuesday I will
be the acknowledged front-runner of the Republican Party with
delegates.''
   Bush, who had bypassed campaigning in the two states, went to
bed in Kentucky without commenting to reporters on the returns.
Dole, for his part, was anything but silent.
   ``I hope we send a message that Bob Dole has a message,'' the
Kansas senator told cheering backers at a victory celebration in
Minneapolis. ``That's what the election is all about. I haven't
changed my message. I'm talking about the future, I've talked about
leadership, I've talked about party responsibility, I've talked
about the left-outs, the down-and-outs in America.''
   Returns from all but one precinct in South Dakota gave Dole 55
percent, Robertson 20 percent, Bush 19 percent and Kemp 5 percent.
   In Minnesota, with returns in from 80 percent of the precincts,
Dole had 42 percent, Robertson 28 percent, Kemp 15 and Bush 11.
   Kemp was in a do-or-die effort to make a competitive showing in
one of the Midwest states. On the last weekend of the campaign,
Kemp inundated South Dakota with biographical television
commercials that emphasized family values and he spent most of the
weekend campaigning in Minnesota. But he spent the election night
in South Carolina, unavailable to reporters.
   In Minnesota, the first order of business in the GOP caucuses
was a non-binding straw poll of presidential preference.
   Robertson startled party regulars in the Iowa caucuses with a
strong second-place finish, well ahead of Bush. The former
evangelist saw Minnesota as a similar situation and he hoped to
repeat his Iowa performance.
   Barb Sykora, chairman of the Minnesota Republican Party, had
predicted a lot of people would attend caucuses for the first time.
   ``I think there are going to be a lot of people coming for Pat
Robertson and for Bob Dole,'' she said.
   ``Where is George Bush?'' taunted Dole during campaign
appearances in South Dakota and Minnesota.
   ``Why vote for someone who doesn't come to the state?'' the
Kansas senator asked an audience in Minneapolis, on the final full
day of campaigning.
   As usual, party officials were unable to project the turnout for
Robertson because so many of his supporters were newcomers to
Republican politics.
   Kemp's best showing so far in the race going into Tuesday's
contests was third place in the New Hampshire primary, well behind
Bush and Dole. The New York congressman hoped a strong showing in
Minnesota would give his campaign renewed energy.
   Kemp was staging a bus tour in South Carolina today. On Tuesday,
he told students at the University of South Carolina in Columbia
that he expects to do well in the state.

<TEXT>
   A coroner has reclassified as homicide
the death of an elderly woman whose head was surgically removed and
frozen in hopes that she could some day be brought back to life
with a new body.
   ``We're saying this was an 83-year-old lady that was ill and
pushed over the edge by the use of a drug,'' Supervising Deputy
Coroner Dan Cupido said Tuesday.
   Dora Kent's death last December at the Alcor Life Extension
Foundation laboratory in Riverside has been under investigation
since January.
   Deputy District Attorney Curt Hinman said he is ``fairly
confident charges will be filed,'' but he did not say who would be
charged, when, or specify the charges.
   The woman's original death certificate indicated she died from
pneumonia in the absence of a doctor, which prompted the coroner's
office to investigate whether she was alive when the procedure to
remove her head was started.
   Authorities seeking to force Alcor to produce the frozen head
have been blocked by an injunction.
   The coroner's office ruled after an autopsy was performed on the
woman's headless body, basing its findings on the opinions of
toxicologists and a pathologist contracted by Riverside County,
Cupido said.
   The woman's son, Saul Kent, and other advocates of cryonics
believe in storing bodies or heads at freezing temperatures in
hopes of someday bringing them back to life through advances in
science.
   Kent said today that the allegations of homicide were ``smear
tactics'' to discredit Alcor. He said the foundation has explained
thoroughly the use of drugs in its notes regarding his mother's
preservation.
   ``Now suddenly to come up and say that they think it's homicide
is kind of absurd,'' he said.
   Kent, who was at the laboratory when his mother's head was
removed, said barbiturates were administered after death to slow
brain damage from lack of oxygen.
   Tests showed levels of pentobarbital and secobarbital throughout
the woman's system, indicating she was alive when she was given the
drugs.
   The amendment to the death certificate filed Tuesday says Mrs.
Kent died between Dec. 9 and Dec. 11, and lists the immediate cause
of death as pneumonia and generalized severe arteriosclerosis.
   The drugs expedited the death, Cupido said.
   ``A patient with that (the illnesses listed on the death
certificate) given barbiturates will go over the edge,'' he said.
   ``It's like you have a gunshot victim who develops pneumonia in
the hospital and dies,'' he said. ``It doesn't mean he wasn't
shot.''
   Michael Federowicz, who was president of Alcor at the time and
was present during the operation, said finding barbiturates in Mrs.
Kent's system does not prove she was alive when the drugs were
administered.

<HEAD>Court Broadens Protection for Some Criminal Defendants in
Wisconsin Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today broadened protection
for criminal defendants who claim they were enticed by law
enforcement officials into committing a crime.
   By a 6-2 vote, the justices overturned a bribery conviction
against Frederick Mathews of Milwaukee, Wis., a former Small
Business Administraton official.
   The court said a criminal defendant should be allowed to
introduce the defense of entrapment at the trial even if he
inconsistently denies committing a criminal act.
   Mathews was sentenced to probation for three years for accepting
a $2,100 loan from James DeShazer, owner of Midwest Knitting Mills.
   Mathews was in charge of a program that provides help to
businesses owned by ``socially and economically disadvantaged''
firms.
   DeShazer, acting as an FBI informant, gave Mathews the money at
a hotel coffee shop on April 23, 1985, and Mathews was arrested as
he left the restaurant.
   Mathews said he needed the money because he had just been told
he was being fired by the SBA and was financially strapped.
   He said he regarded the money as a personal favor from DeShazer
and denied the loan was a bribe to get him to help DeShazer receive
advance payments from the government on a Pentagon contract for
Midwest Knitting Mills.
   A federal judge refused to allow Mathews to present evidence to
the jury to support his claim of entrapment unless he also admitted
that he intended to commit a crime.
   The Supreme Court today said Mathews should be allowed to claim
entrapment while denying he took the money with criminal intent.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, in his opinion for the
court, noted that an entrapment defense is based on a defendant's
claim that he was induced into comitting the crime and lacked a
predisposition to engage in criminal conduct.
   The government argued that a jury cannot logically conclude that
a defendant both failed to commit the elements of the alleged
offense and was entrapped.
   But Rehnquist said defendants are allowed to be inconsistent. He
rejected the government's claim that allowing inconsistent defenses
will encourage perjury, confuse jurors and subvert the
truth-finding purpose of a trial.
   ``We are simply not persuaded by the government's arguments that
we should make the availability of an instruction on entrapment
where the evidence justifies it subject to a requirement of
consistency to which no other such defense is subject,'' Rehnquist
said.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, in a separate concurring opinion, said
he voted with the majority, but only because he believes ``when
genuine inconsistency exists its effect in destroying the
defendant's credibility will suffice to protect the interests of
justice.''
   Dissenting were Justices Byron R. White and Harry A. Blackmun.
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court last Thursday, did
not take part in the decision.
   The case is Mathews vs. U.S., 86-6109.

   Treasurer A. James Manchin today backed
down on his threat to halt all state government checks because of a
state Supreme Court decision invalidating the budget.
   ``It's nothing more than hot air and a whimper of the wind,''
Manchin said of Tuesday's 3-2 ruling by the court, which said the
Legislature had appropriated $26 million more than Gov. Arch Moore
said would be available. The state Constitution requires a balanced
budget.
   Manchin released a number of checks for hospital workers today,
less than 24 hours after threatening to halt the processing of all
state bills. He said the decision allows for a 60-day grace period,
and for a petition for a rehearing, meaning the case won't be
resolved until after the June 30 end of the fiscal year by the time
the court issues a final ruling.
   He called the court decision a ``token action to appease the
West Virginia Education Association,'' and labeled it a ``charade.''
   Legislative leaders say they will ask the court for a rehearing
with the 60-day grace period. Moore has already scheduled a special
session of the Legislature for April 12 to look at education
matters, and the budget question presumably could be considered at
that time.
   Moore, a Republican, had called the treasurer's threat to stop
payments ridiculous. Manchin, a Democrat, had countered Tuesday by
calling the governor's criticism ``rubbish.''
   The governor was in Welch today and could not be reached
immediately for comment on Manchin's decision to release paychecks.
However, press secretary John Price said Moore had a possible
safety valve: a bill he received Tuesday would allow him to borrow
up to $50 million from the state consolidated investment fund of
pension and workers' compensation money.
   Moore is bickering with the Legislature, however, over a
provision that requires him to pay the money back by Sept. 30,
Price said.
   Amid the bitter verbal battle, all sides agreed that the state
was lurching toward a crisis Monday, when a bimonthly payroll of
$15 million is due to go out to 40,000 state employees.
   ``As of this moment, all of the checks are stopped,'' Manchin,
one of three state officials who must sign all checks, had said
Tuesday.
   The high court's ruling, written by Justice Darrell McGraw, did
not tell Moore and the Legislature what to do, saying simply, ``We
presume the governor and Legislature will do their duties.''
   Senate President Dan Tonkovich, a Democrat, said the Legislature
will petition the high court for a rehearing.
   Moore, who was named as a defendant in the court case, never
contested that the budget was unconstitutionally out of balance.
   The state is suffering from slumping tax collections, with
revenue $35.7 million behind projections as of the end of January.
   The New York-based investment firm Standard and Poor's Corp. on
Dec. 15 issued a national warning covering $900 million of West
Virginia's bonds, saying that neither the Legislature nor the
executive branch was addressing the state's ``deteriorating
financial picture.''
   The financial officer at West Virginia University, which employs
more than 8,000 state workers, criticized the court's overturning
of the state budget.
   ``I don't know how you can just shut down the whole world,''
said John Signorelli, associate vice president for finances at the
Morgantown campus.
   Others supported the ruling, including officials of the West
Virginia Education Association, which last year filed the lawsuit
leading to the decision. The suit challenged $13.5 million in cuts
for education funding.
   ``I think it's great. The financing of education is, among
mandated public services, the first constitutional priority,'' said
James Caruth, executive secretary of the 18,500-member association.
   State House parliamentarian Gregory Gray said it was the first
time he knew of that the state's budget was thrown out as
unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for the Bible Speaks Church
have filed notice they plan to appeal a federal judge's decision
upholding the $6.6 million claim of an heiress who charged she had
been duped into donating money.
   The notice, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Springfield,
said the fundamentalist church plans to ask a federal appeals court
in Boston to overturn U.S. District Judge Frank Freedman's decision
in the case.
   In January, Freedman upheld a U.S. Bankruptcy judge's ruling
supporting a $6.6 million claim against the church by heiress
Elizabeth Dovydenas. Mrs. Dovydenas, of Lenox, maintained that she
was duped into donating the money by church founder and president
Carl H. Stevens.
   Meanwhile, a trustee appointed by the Bankruptcy Court said
Tuesday he hoped to receive additional bids for the church's Lenox
headquarters before a Feb. 28 deadline.
   Trustee David Ferrari said the only bid he has gotten for the
65-acre campus with 28 buildings has been a $2.5 million offer from
Woodland Properties, a Pittsfield-based real estate company. Andrew
Kelly, an executive with Woodland Properties, has declined to
discuss his plans for the property.
   The campus closed a few weeks after Mrs. Dovydenas prevailed in
Bankruptcy Court. She was the high bidder at a November auction of
the church headquarters, but the Bankruptcy Court rejected her $1.8
million bid as too low. The campus has been appraised at $6 million.
   Her claim is the largest of the hundreds of creditors, who claim
they are owed a total of $7 million by the church.

   House Democrats scrambled today to assemble
majority support for Thursday's vote on a $30 million
``humanitarian'' aid package for Nicaragua, including roughly equal
amounts for the Contra rebels and for children who are victims of
the country's seven-year civil war.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, called it ``the most workable
kind of program'' and one that will provide ``balanced incentives''
for the Contras and the leftist Sandinista government to pursue
peace talks called for in a regional accord.
   The package was unveiled late Tuesday by Rep. David Bonior,
D-Mich., after two weeks of intensive negotiations among several
factions of the chamber's majority party. It went before the Rules
Committee today, where Republicans were expected to demand the
right to offer their own alternative.
   President Reagan did not immediately react to the Democrats'
package. His own $36.2 million aid proposal for the rebels,
including weapons, was narrowly rejected by the House three weeks
ago.
   Among major elements in the Democratic proposal:
   _About $3.6 million a month for the Contras: half to buy food,
clothing, medicine and shelter, and the other half to pay for
delivery of the supplies to rebel troops inside Nicaragua. The aid
would run from March 1, after current aid expires, until June 30.
It could continue until the end of the year if a cease-fire is
reached by June 30.
   _About $1.4 million for Nicaragua's Miskito Indians, an
opposition group that has been carrying out its own battle against
the Sandinistas, but has consistently refused invitations to join
with the Contras. The Indians already have worked out their own
cease-fire with the Managua regime.
   _A new $14 million ``Children's Survival Fund,'' to provide
medical help for children on all sides of the conflict. The aid
would be administered by ``non-political'' private aid groups or
international relief agencies already working in the region.
   Not included in the package was any long-term economic
development aid for the region, but a Democratic fact sheet said
``Congress will welcome proposals'' from Reagan on that subject.
   Current aid to the rebels expires Feb. 29, and with it the legal
authority for the CIA to continue air drops of previously
stockpiled weapons and ammunition. The new package contains no such
authority.
   Under the new proposal, the Contras' ``humanitarian'' supplies
would be delivered by private contractors supervised by the Defense
Department until the Contras and the Sandinistas are able to agree
on a cease-fire.
   The deliveries would be monitored by the congressional
intelligence committees and the General Accounting Office,
Congress' investigative arm, to ensure that no weapons were
included.
   After fighting stops, responsibility for delivery would shift to
a private aid group or an international relief agency such as the
Red Cross.
   The package also would provide for an expedited procedure for a
vote on new military aid for the rebels _ a high priority for the
Reagan administration _ if a cease-fire should fall apart and the
Sandinistas should fail to keep their promises to democratize.
   The determination of whether expedited procedures should be
initiated would be made by the House Intelligence Committees,
according to a fact sheet on the package. But Republicans were
skeptical of the provision, saying it was not a solid guarantee
that military aid would come to a quick vote in both the House and
Senate.
   Wright said he was ``not necessarily'' confident of the votes to
pass the package. Republicans have remained aloof from the drafting
process, holding out for more aid and for continued authority for
the CIA to deliver previously stockpiled weapons.
   ``The key to this really will be how much support it gets on the
Republican side,'' said Solarz, a longtime Contra aid opponent who
added that he planned to vote against the package.
   Other Democrats said they expected at least 70 in their party to
oppose the proposal.
   ``The party is seeking a middle ground on an issue that is not
compromisable,'' said Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. ``It appears
to me to be an exercise in attempting to cover ourselves'' and
avoid political blame if the Contras go out of business and the
Sandinistas renege on promises to increase civil liberties.
   Democrats have argued against new military aid, saying that
providing it would endanger peace efforts. Talks between the
Contras and Sandinistas broke off over the weekend without
progress, and no date has been set for their resumption.
   Reagan and many congressional Republicans have countered that it
is only consistent military pressure from rebel attacks that has
forced the Sandinistas into peace talks.

   A 16-month-old girl bitten by a horde of
ants was in critical condition today in the children's intensive
care unit of Sacred Heart Hospital, a spokeswoman said.
   Tiffany Cheatam of Navarre, a small Santa Rosa County community
about 20 miles east of this Florida Panhandle city, had stopped
breathing when rescuers arrived at her home shortly after noon
Tuesday, said James Chalmers, an emergency medical technician for
the Holley-Navarre Volunteer Fire Department.
   ``There were ants crawling all over the child,'' Chalmers said.
   Ann Papadelias, a Sacred Heart spokeswoman, said she suspected
the attack was by fire ants, known for their vicious sting, but she
was unable to confirm that with doctors, who were busy treating the
child. Rescuers also said they were unsure what kind of ants were
involved.
   A witness said a dog knocked the girl into a bed of ants in the
child's backyard, said Chief Don Van Derry of the Holley-Navarre
Fire and Rescue Association.
   She was revived through cardiopulminary resuscitation and then a
Life Flight helicopter initially transported her to Gulf Breeze
Hospital. The helicopter later transferred her to Sacred Heart
which has a children's unit.

<TEXT>
   Jimmy Swaggart was followed to a
``crummy'' motel by men who let air out of his tires and
photographed him as he tried to put a spare tire on backwards,
visited a reputed prostitute and was confronted by a rival
evangelist, a church leader said.
   James Hamill of Memphis, Tenn., a member of the general council
of the Assemblies of God, the nation's largest Pentecostal
denomination, described the pictures in an interview with WBRZ-TV
here Tuesday.
   He also said he expects the council to strengthen the punishment
Swaggart receives from executives of his 2 million-member
denomination after admitting ``moral failures.''
   The Louisiana district council has recommended a three-month
suspension and counseling for the TV evangelist, whose ministry
reaches more than 100 countries and reported $142 million in income
last year.
   ``The constitution and bylaws require at least a year's
cessation of active ministry,'' Hamill said.
   The executive presbytery of the Assemblies of God will make the
final decision in the Swaggart case. Rev. Everett Stenhouse,
Assemblies of God general secretary, said the group was tentatively
scheduled to meet Thursday.
   Church spokeswoman Juleen Turnage said an extra telephone
operator had to be hired at church headquarters in Springfield,
Mo., to handle some of the hundreds of calls about the case. She
said Swaggart had as many supporters as detractors among the
callers.
   Hamill described the photographs that led Swaggart to make a
tearful confession of sin Sunday, and disclosed that the Rev.
Marvin Gorman of New Orleans was directly involved in the
picture-taking.
   Last year, Gorman sued Swaggart for $90 million charging him
with unjustly accusing Gorman of repeatedly committing adultery.
Gorman admitted a single ``immoral act'' with a woman.
   The pictures, which ABC News reported last week were given to
denomination leaders by Gorman, ``showed a motel _ a crummy little
thing built in an L-shape _ they showed the number of this
particular room and a woman accused of being a prostitute admitting
several different men into the room, and eventually Jimmy Swaggart
going into the room and later coming out of the room,'' Hamill said.
   ``And she came out a few moments behind him, and (Swaggart) had
a flat tire on his car. These men who made the pictures had the let
air out of his tires.
   ``When he went into the room, they called Rev. Gorman and he
came down and Jimmy Swaggart was changing his tire, and there's
pictures of he and Gorman talking to one another, just pictures, no
sound,'' Hamill said.
   Swaggart struggled with the tire and ``he put the wheel on
backwards,'' Hamill said.
   Swaggart couldn't be reached for comment; church officials
wouldn't say where he was.
   Gorman attorney Hunter W. Lundy confirmed that he employed a
private investigator, Reed Scott Bailey, in connection with the
lawsuit against Swaggart.
   Bailey and another investigator visited a strip of cheap motels
on Airline Highway between Baton Rouge and New Orleans to ask
questions about Swaggart, a motel resident said.
   The woman, who identified herself as Peggy Carrier, 39, was
quoted by the New Orleans Times-Picayune as saying Swaggart on
several occasions visited two Airline Highway motels, where he
would park his Lincoln Town Car in the rear.
   Syndicated columnist Cal Thomas, who specializes in
fundamentalist religions, said reports that Swaggart sought
pornographic acts rather than sexual intercourse probably led the
Louisiana council to conclude that he had not technically committed
adultery, which would have resulted in a harsher punishment.
   One of the state council members involved in recommending
rehabilitation for Swaggart said the presbyters regard his ministry
as a gift from God.
   ``We had to look beyond the man to the ministry God has given
him,'' said the Rev. Jonathan Ziegler of Violet.
   ``Our objective was not only to rehabilitate a man but to save a
unique ministry that feeds thousands of children a day, supports a
multitude of missionaries and helps improve countless lives with
the Gospel of Jesus Christ,'' Ziegler said.
   Meanwhile, the Christian Broadcasting Network announced
Wednesday that it will not carry any programs from the Swaggart
ministry in which he personally appears so long as Swaggart is
suspended by his denomination.
   ``We have arrived at an arrangement whereby the Swaggart
ministries will provide alternative programming,'' said Benton
Miller, spokesman for CBN.

<HEAD>Court Bolsters Right of Default-Judgment Losers in Texas Case</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Businessman's Name Listed in Court Papers as R. ``Roy''
Peralta</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today bolstered the right
default-judgment losers have to challenge a judgment entered after
they fail to respond to a lawsuit.
   The justices unanimously ruled for Houston businessman R.
``Roy'' Peralta in his challenge of a default judgment awarded
against him six years ago for a $5,000 debt owed to a medical
center.
   Texas courts had ruled that such challenges are impermissible
unless the judgment loser had a ``meritorious defense'' to the
lawsuit.
   But writing for the high court, Justice Byron R. White said the
Texas rulings do not sufficiently protect the due-process rights of
people who contend they were never notified about the lawsuits that
resulted in the default judgments against them.
   For example, White said, Peralta could have worked out a
settlement or paid the debt or himself sold the property that was
seized to satisfy the debt.
   Peralta owned and operated a commercial diving business in
Houston when, in 1981, he guaranteed a $5,000 debt incurred by one
of his employees to the Heights Medical Center Inc.
   The employee failed to make good on the debt, and the center
sought to collect the debt by suing Peralta in early 1982. Peralta
contends he was never notified about the lawsuit.
   A default judgment against him was issued in July 1982 _ and
property his lawyers say was valued at more than $180,000 was
auctioned off to satisfy the $5,000 debt.
   When Peralta challenged the default judgment and subsequent
sales of his property, his appeal was dismissed because he could
not prove a meritorious defense to the underlying debt lawsuit _ a
requirement under Texas law.
   In ruling for Peralta, White said, ``Where a person has been
deprived of property in a manner contrary to the most basic tenets
of due process, it is no answer to say that in his particular case
due process of law would have led to the same result.''
   He added: ``Only wiping the slate clean would have restored
(Peralta) to the position he would have occupied had due process of
law been accorded to him in the first place.''
   The court's vote was 8-0. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined
the court Thursday, did not participate in the decision.
   The case is Peralta vs. Heights Medical Center, 86-1430.

   A federal judge today refused to
permit testimony about Nazi memorabilia reportedly seen in the home
of Carlos Lehder Rivas, who is on trial for cocaine smuggling.
   U.S. District Judge Howell W. Melton ruled that it was
inadmissable and prejudicial for Gorman Bannister, a protected
federal witness, to mention seeing a gold swastika and statue of
Adolf Hitler in Lehder's home in Medellin, Colombia.
   Lehder, 38, a reputed leader of the violent Colombian Medellin
cartel, is on trial on charges that he conspired to smuggle 3.3
tons of cocaine into the United States from Colombia via an island
he controlled in the Bahamas.
   Bannister told the jury that his father, Everette Bannister,
funneled money to Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling to protect
Lehder's smuggling operation on the Bahamian island of Norman's Cay.
   U.S. Attorney Robert W. Merkle and Melton got into an exchange
after the judge ruled against the jury hearing testimony about
swastikas and statues in the home of Lehder, a Colombian of German
descent.
   ``I am absolutely befuddled at the court's ruling,'' Merkle said.
   ``If you continue,'' replied Melton, ``you will be in contempt
of court.''
   Bannister said his father, the chairman of Bahamas World
Airlines, had agreed in 1981 to accept $100,000 a month from Lehder
for the use of Norman's Cay.
   His father received only one month's payment.
   Lehder is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine with
intent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating a
continuing criminal enterprise.
   Co-defendant Jack Cartlon Reed, 57, is charged only with being
part of the alleged conspiracy.

<HEAD>Court Rules Judges Lack Authority to Order Fees Paid in Arkansas
Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today ruled that federal
judges lack authority to order the government to pay fees to
lawyers who successfully obtain overdue federal welfare for poor
people who are aged, blind or disabled.
   The 8-0 ruling in a case from Arkansas held that federal
officials are not required by law to withhold a portion of a
recipient's benefits to pay the attorney.
   Justice William J. Brennan, writing for the court, said Congress
made it clear that attorney's fees were not to be paid in such
cases where past-due benefits under the Supplemental Security
Income program (SSI) are awarded to recipients.
   The decision, a victory for the Reagan administration, reversed
a ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a case
involving benefits for Mary Alice Galbreath.
   Ms. Galbreath applied for benefits on May 26, 1982, but the
Department of Health and Human Services denied her request.
   She hired a lawyer, Anthony W. Bartels of Jonesboro, Ark., and
he won a federal court suit on Feb. 15, 1985, awarding her $7,954
in past-due benefits.
   Bartels then asked the federal judge to award him $1,988 _ or 25
percent of the amount paid Ms. Galbreath _ for representing her.
   The judge ordered the government to pay the attorney and the 8th
Circuit court agreed. The appeals court said requiring payment to
lawyers in such cases assures recipients will have adequate legal
representation.
   Health and Human Services officials said to comply with the
ruling it would be necessary to recover the $1,988 from Ms.
Galbreath. The department also said it would create administrative
headaches for the agency since in 1985 alone there were some 8,000
cases involving disputed claims for SSI benefits.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined the court last Thursday,
did not take part in the decision.
   The case is Bowen vs. Galbreath, 86-1146.

   Republican presidential candidate Pat Robertson
said today that his Christian Broadcasting Network knew the
whereabouts of the American hostages held in Lebanon and he
suggested that they could have been rescued.
   ``We identified in our news department at CBN the location of
those hostages in Lebanon very shortly after they were taken, and
they were in a position where they could have been rescued,'' the
former television evangelist said during a campaign stop in Georgia.
   ``They were in Beirut, and they could have been freed,'' he said.
   Robertson did not provide any more specifics and did not say
which hostages were involved.
   Nine Americans remain in captivity in Lebanon, including Marine
Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, who was heading the 75-man observer
group attached to the United Nations Interim Force when he was
captured last week.
   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, is the longest-held captive. Anderson was
kidnapped on March 16, 1985.
   Robertson, asked if he had informed Reagan administration
officials about the CBN information, said: ``I broadcast it on
national television. They monitor our programs virtually every day.
Their speechwriters used to watch us to get some concepts for
speeches.''
   In Washington, a State Department terrorism expert said he was
puzzled by Robertson's statements.
   The official, who requested anonymity, said he was unaware that
CBN ever broadcast the precise locations of any hostages. He also
said it was unclear from Robertson's statements which hostages he
was referring to, since Americans have been taken captive at
various times over the past several years.
   Knowledge of the hostages' whereabouts in terms of a particular
city or even a section of a city wouldn't be enough to mount a
rescue mission, the official said.
   In his statements, Robertson urged the administration to take
more effective action against terrorists.
   The U.S. reaction ``must be more like the Israelis at Entebbe.
It has to be quick, and it has to be a surprise,'' he said.
   Last July, Robertson said he ran into Lt. Col. Oliver North, a
key figure in the Iran-Contra affair, on Sept. 13, 1985, at
Washington National Airport. The then-White House aide said he was
en route to Tehran to negotiate the release of the hostages,
according to Robertson.
   Six days later, Robertson said he interviewed President Reagan
for CBN, saying to the president, ``I understand that a member of
your official family has gone to Iran to negotiate the release of
the hostages.''
   During a Republican presidential debate on Feb. 14, Robertson's
allegation that the Soviets have nuclear missiles in Cuba touched
off a controversy, bringing administration denials.
   Robertson said during the debate, ``Some information came to me
that the Soviets, in violation of the so-called Khrushchev-Kennedy
accords, have put some SS-4s and SS-5s in Cuba. ... It seems like,
to me, nukes pointing at the United States are more vital to our
security than nukes pointing to Europe.''
   Robertson said he based his claim on testimony by Adm. William
J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, before the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   The day after the debate, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said SS-4 and SS-5 missile sites established in Cuba in 1962 ``were
confirmed as having been destroyed in that year. We also are
confident that the missiles were removed from Cuba at that time.''

   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said today
James H. Webb never came to him to protest cuts in the Navy's
budget before abruptly resigning as secretary of the Navy with a
blast at Carlucci's leadership.
   Carlucci told the House Armed Services Committee that he had
been forced to make ``tough choices'' in cutting the growth of the
defense budget. He warned the reductions mean ``increasing risks to
our national security.''
   Carlucci said Webb ``never came to me with any protests on
budget cuts nor was I aware of his intention to resign until his
letter landed on my desk.'
   Later, Carlucci said Webb ``never elected to come and talk to
me.''
   In resigning, Webb accused Carlucci of scuttling plans to
achieve the administration's long-standing goal of a 600-ship Navy.
He said that could have been achieved even within the budgetary
limits imposed by Congress and the White House.
   Republican presidential hopeful Jack Kemp said today that the
administration and Carlucci had made a `'terrible mistake
accommodating itself to the mindless cuts in defense'' and added:
``I think the wrong man resigned. It shouldn't have been Webb. It
should have been Carlucci.''
   Carlucci, referring to his decision to retire 16 aging frigates,
said the creation of a 600-ship navy was not abandoned, only
delayed until the in the 1990s.
   ``Tough choices had to be made to accommodate this reduction in
the short time available,'' said Carlucci, referring to an
agreement between President eagan and Congress to reduce defense
spending by $33 billion in two months.
   On Tuesday, Reagan named William L. Ball III, a soft-spoken
Southerner with a reputation as a savvy, behind-the-scenes
negotiator to replace the pugnacious, controversial Webb.
   At the same time, the White House said Reagan intends to stand
by his 600-ship goal, even though he won't be in office to see it
realized. It also offered words of encouragement for Carlucci and
the new nominee.
   ``We look to Will Ball to continue working aggressively for a
strong U.S. Navy,'' spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Budget constraints have delayed a 600-vessel Navy, but it should
still be realized in fiscal year 1992 or thereabouts, Fitzwater
said.
   ``The budget restructuring under way at the Pentagon now is a
difficult and painful process,'' Fitzwater said. ``Secretary
Carlucci is doing an admirable job. He's quite capable and suitable
to the task, and he's carrying out the president's policies in that
regard.''
   Of Ball, he said, ``All of us who know him here at the White
House know that the Navy is getting a strong advocate and a strong
fighter.''
   Ball is expected to have little difficulty winning Senate
confirmation, since the nomination will be reviewed by the Senate
Armed Services Committee, where he once was an aide.
   The 39-year-old has been the president's chief congressional
lobbyist since February 1986. Before that, he served as the State
Department's chief liaison with Congress.
   From 1981 to 1985 he was administrative assistant to then Sen.
John Tower, R-Texas, serving also as chief clerk of the Senate
Armed Services Committee in 1981. He also worked as administrative
assistant to former Sen. Herman Talmadge, D-Ga., in 1978.
   The South Carolina native is a graduate of the Georgia Institute
of Technology and was a regular officer in the Navy from 1969 to
1975.
   As secretary of the Navy, Ball will oversee approximately
584,000 Navy personnel and 199,000 Marines.
   Several Navy officials said Tuesday that Ball was an unknown who
would confront a ``show-me'' attitude within the Navy.
   ``We've had two very exceptional secretaries of the Navy in the
last seven years,'' said one official who asked not to be named.
``And you just don't find that caliber of individual on every
street corner. So there is anxiety.''
   Another official said Webb's sudden departure on Monday had hurt
morale within the Navy, ``but hopefully that's only temporary.''
   ``The thing is, we're used now to having an aggressive secretary
who really fights for us inside and outside the building. And
that's what we want to see in Ball,'' he added.

   Communist Party officials today named an Armenian
as leader of a disputed region of the Caucasus Mountains after
major protests in the Armenian capital that one source said drew up
to 200,000 people.
   The official Tass news agency announced late today that Genrikh
Pogosyan, 56, was named by the regional party committee to replace
Boris Kevorkov as head of Nagorno-Karabakhskaya.
   A later Tass dispatch said Armenian party leaders had agreed
with the Communist Party Central Committee that the region should
remain under jurisdiction of the region of Azerbaidzhan, rather
than being annexed by Armenia.
   Tass said Armenian leaders had gathered to consider ``urgent
measures to normalize the situation'' in the Armenian capital,
Yerevan, but it gave no details of the unrest.
   A former political prisoner said earlier that soldiers brought
tanks into Nagorno-Karabakhskaya to put down protests there and
that rumors had reached Yerevan that some demonstrators were killed.
   Paruyr Ayrikyan, the former prisoner, said in a phone call from
Yerevan that 200,000 demonstrators converged on the capital's
central square today, demanding an extraordinary meeting of the
Armenian parliament to resolve the dispute over control of
Nagorno-Karabakhskaya.
   ``There are at least 200,000 people in front of the opera house
_ I've never seen anything like it,'' Ayrikyan said. He said he was
speaking from an apartment 100 yards from the protest.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov confirmed that
the territory dispute had prompted a major street demonstration in
Yerevan, 1,100 miles south of Moscow. He said the gathering was
peaceful and that he not know the number of protesters.
   Gerasimov confirmed that four senior officials of the national
Communist Party Central Committee were sent to the disputed region
to quell the protests.
   It was not immediately clear whether transfer of power to an
Armenian would end the dispute, but the naming of Pogosyan appeared
to be a concession by the party to the Yerevan protesters' concerns.
   Today was the second day of unrest in the Armenian capital and
included widespread strikes and school boycotts, Ayrikyan said.
   Nagorno-Karabakhskaya is 1,760 square miles in area, slightly
smaller than Delaware. Most of its 150,000 people are Armenians.
   Outbreaks of ethnic tensions have occurred with increasing
frequency over the past year as Soviets embrace party chief Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's call for ``glasnost,'' or more openness in tackling
the nation's social problems.
   In a speech to the Central Committee last week, Gorbachev
expressed concern over nationalist tendencies among the more than
100 peoples comprising the Soviet Union and called for a special
meeting to look into the problem.
   In a Tass dispatch Tuesday, the government took the unusual step
of acknowledging the unrest. The report, read on national
television, said the demands of the demonstrators ``contradict the
interests of the working people.''
   The government newspaper Izvestia on Tuesday night acknowledged
a ``mass meeting'' of protesters in Yerevan, student boycotts and
the involvement of national party officials in trying to resolve
the conflict.
   Today's edition of the Communist Party daily Pravda carried the
Tass report, but no commentary on the events.
   Ayrikyan said two members of the party Central Committee's
Secretariat, Vladimir I. Dolgikh and Anatoly I. Lukyanov, arrived
in Yerevan on Tuesday ``to calm the people.''
   Today, Lukyanov and Dolgikh persuaded the demonstrators to send
a small delegation to party headquarters in Yerevan to discuss the
dispute, Ayrikyan said.
   Attempts to reach the offices of Sovietskaya Armenia, the
republic's main newspaper, for an official account of today's
incident were unsuccessful, and calls to other Yerevan telephones
also did not go through.
   Ayrikyan, 38, spent 17 years in labor camps and exile for
heading an underground Armenian nationalist group in the 1960s.
   Moscow dissident Tamara Grigoryants said Nagorno-Karabakhskaya,
in the Caucasus Mountains north of Turkey, was deeded to
Azerbaidzhan in the early 1920s.
   Earlier this month, the local government council asked that the
region become part of Armenia, citing the Soviet Constitution's
guarantee of the right of self-determination, Ayrikyan said. The
party Central Committee rejected the request.
   Nagorno-Karabakhskaya was the scene of other mass demonstrations
last fall when ethnic Armenians marched to protest what they
claimed was mistreatment by Azeris, the dominant population of
Azerbaidzhan.
   Today was also the 70th anniversary of independent Estonia, a
small republic on the Baltic coast that was incorporated into the
Soviet Union in 1940. The official Soviet news agency Tass
complained that Western political figures were encouraging unrest
there, a sign demonstrations were expected.

<HEAD>Company Announces Condom To Be Worn By Women</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new contraceptive which resembles a condom but
is worn by women will be tested in the United States this spring, a
pharmaceutical company announced today.
   The disposable device may be one of the most effective ways of
reducing the risk of sexually transmitted disease, said Mary Ann
Leeper, a researcher at Wisconsin Pharmacal, which hopes to market
the device.
   The company, based in Jackson, Wis., said the device provides
more protection than the male condom, in part because the material
is stronger than most condoms and covers a larger physical area,
reducing chances of infection or exposure to body fluids.
   The company hopes to submit an application to the Food and Drug
Administration this summer to permit sales of the device, Ms.
Leeper said at a news conference.
   There was no estimate on the retail price.
   The product has undergone clinical trials in Denmark, the United
Kingdom and several other European countries, the company said.
   The condom was developed by an international group of
gynecologists and obstetricians, headed by Danish gynecologist Dr.
Erik Gregerson and his wife, Bente.
   The condom consists of a soft, loose-fitting polyurethane sheath
and two diaphragm-like, flexible polyurethane rings, Ms. Leeper
said.
   One of the rings lies inside the sheath and serves as insertion
mechanism and internal anchor, much like a diaphragm. The other
ring forms the outer edge of the sheath and remains outside the
vagina.

   Republican presidential hopeful Bob Dole was riding high today
after twin victories over George Bush in Midwestern preludes to
next month's Super Tuesday showdowns, but Bush brushed off his
losses. Democrats Richard Gephardt and Michael Dukakis swapped
victories and said they were eager to carry their battle to the
South.
   Meanwhile, Democrat Paul Simon said today he would bypass the
March 8 collection of 20 primaries and caucuses, citing a lack of
money and the belief that Super Tuesday would result ``in a very
mixed picture.''
   ``The campaign will begin anew after Super Tuesday, starting in
Illinois'' on March 15, the Illinois senator told reporters in
Washington.
   Republican Pat Robertson, campaigning in Georgia, said the news
staff at his Christian Broadcasting Network once knew the
whereabouts of hostages in Beirut _ proving, he said, they could
have been rescued.
   The U.S. reaction to terrorism, Robertson said, ``has to be
quick, and it has to be a surprise. ... We identified in our news
department at CBN the location of those hostages in Lebanon very
shortly after they were taken, and they were in a position where
they could have been rescued. They were in Beirut, and they could
have been freed.''
   Robertson, asked if he had informed the Reagan administration,
said, ``I broadcast it on national television; they monitor our
programs virtually every day.''
   Bush brushed off his losses in South Dakota and Minnesota,
saying today after arriving to campaign in Portland, Maine, ``You
can't win them all.''
   The vice president, who made virtually no effort in the two
upper Midwestern states, said, ``I think the result was somewhat
anticipated; you can't go everywhere.'' He added, ``We've done well
out there. We've won in Michigan and in Nevada.''
   Tuesday night, Dukakis said after splitting the two upper
Midwestern contests with Gephardt, ``This is a marathon. It's going
to be a long one.''
   The Massachusetts governor won in Minnesota on Tuesday, and
dealt Simon a crushing defeat. Gephardt was the winner in South
Dakota with Dukakis a respectable second.
   Dole won both states going away _ with Bush far, far behind. In
Minnesota, the vice president finished fourth behind Robertson and
Rep. Jack Kemp. In South Dakota, with Dole winning all 18 of the
delegates at stake, Bush was narrowly edged for second place by
Robertson.
   The former television evangelist said today in Atlanta, ``This
helps me enormously as I go into the Super Tuesday states.'' He
added, ``I believe that coming out of Super Tuesday I will be the
acknowledged front-runner of the Republican Party with delegates.''
   Wasting no time before heading for the next battleground, Dole
was flying to South Carolina today for four quick campaign
appearances.
   ``I hope it can help me in the South,'' Dole said of his latest
victories. ``I've got a big hill to climb in the South.''
   Bush was buried in the Tuesday night returns, running third in
South Dakota and fourth in Minnesota. After his embarrassing defeat
two weeks ago in Iowa, Bush chose to head South rather than take on
Dole again in the Midwest.
   It was up one week and down the next in the GOP race. After
Dole's strong Iowa showing, Bush bounced back to win the New
Hampshire primary a week ago. This was Dole's week again, but now
the scene shifts to the South, where Bush is regarded as the
front-runner.
   Gephardt and Dukakis were quick to hail their Midwest victories.
   ``This...was a great victory that we have had in South Dakota,''
said the Missouri congressman.
   Dukakis, who finished second in South Dakota, said, ``I think
it's very good news for us because we've finished strong in every
one of these states.''
   Also able to claim a measure of victory was Democrat Jesse
Jackson, who was leading Simon for second place in Minnesota.
   One-time Democratic front-runner Gary Hart also had a thumbs
down for his lonely campaign to ``let the people decide.'' Hart got
5 percent of the vote in South Dakota and 1 percent in Minnesota.
Unable to get 10 percent of the vote in two consecutive primaries,
Hart stands to lose his eligibility for federal matching funds.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee described his third-place
finish in South Dakota as a ``pleasant surprise,'' though he worked
hard in the state and got just 8 percent of the vote.
   In returns from all but one of South Dakota's 1,151 precincts,
Dole had 51,529 or 55 percent of the vote compared to 18,275 or
just under 20 percent for Robertson and 17,416 or 19 percent for
Bush. Kemp trailed with 5 percent.
   That meant Dole led for all of the state's 18 delegates to the
Republican National Convention in New Orleans next summer.
Robertson was just short of qualifying for delegates with one
precinct's votes uncounted.
   None of the other three contests was directly allocating
delegates, although each of the winners was getting an edge in the
process.
   With all but one of the Democratic precincts reporting in South
Dakota, Gephardt had 31,226 or 44 percent and Dukakis 22,367 or 31
percent. The also rans were Gore at 8 percent, Simon at 6 percent
and Hart and Jackson at 5 percent each.
   In Minnesota, Republican results from 80 percent of the
precincts gave Dole 43 percent to 28 percent for Robertson. Kemp
was third with 15 percent and Bush was running fourth with 11
percent.
   The Democratic caucus procedure in Minnesota was complicated and
returns were still trickling in well past midnight. With 74 percent
of the precincts reporting, Dukakis had 34 percent of the vote.
Jackson had just under 20 percent, with 19 percent uncommitted.
Simon had 18 percent, while Gephardt had 7 percent. Hart and Gore
had 1 percent each.

   Patton Electric Co. of New Haven, Ind., has
agreed to pay a $90,000 penalty to settle charges that it failed to
promptly report defects in portable electric heaters it imported
from Hong Kong, the Consumer Product Safety Commission announced
Wednesday.
   The Commission had charged that Patton delayed informing it that
the Model HF-10 space heaters contained a diode that could fail in
low heat mode, producing intense heat and potentially leading to a
fire.
   Patton had received reports of 51 incidents, including the death
of an 18-month-old baby, before notified the commission of problems
with the heaters in February 1984, the agency said.
   Patton imported 148,302 of the heaters in 1983, which were sold
nationwide under the Patton and Sears names. They were recalled in
1984.
   Anyone needing more information can contact the commission at
1-800-628-2772.

<HEAD>Reagan Will Oppose Congressional Notification Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CIA Director William Webster testified today
that President Reagan would reject legislation tying his hands on
covert activities, including any requirement that he tell Congress
of secret operations within 48 hours.
   Webster told a House panel he agreed with the lawmakers' goal of
preventing another Iran-Contra affair by tightening control of
covert operations, but said a presidentially approved national
security directive would do the job.
   The Reagan administration has already lost round one in its
battle to maintain greater discretion on when to notify Congress.
The Senate Intelligence Committee voted 13-2 for legislation that
includes the 48-hour requirement, and is similar in other respects
to a House bill Webster is now trying to derail.
   ``A bill which fails to preserve the flexibility and authority
the president needs to conduct intelligence activities effectively
will not be acceptable to the president,'' Webster warned, although
he did not use the word ``veto.''
   Members of both intelligence committees introduced the
legislation after Reagan failed for 10 months to notify Congress of
his February 1986 approval of U.S. arms sales to Iran. And he did
so only after a Lebanese publication exposed the U.S.-Iranian
negotiations to free American hostages.
   A number of lawmakers said quick notification would have given
them a chance to presuade Reagan that his policy was a mistake.
   The law now requires an administration to give Congress prior
notification of significant intelligence activities, but allows the
president to delay that in extraordinary circumstances. The
notification must then take place in a ``timely fashion,'' although
the word ``timely'' is left vague.
   In fact, Webster said, there have been only three times when
notification has taken more than two days: the Iran-Contra affair;
the rescue of Americans from Iran who were hidden by Canadian
diplomats, and the failed military attempt to rescue American
hostages in Iran.
   Testifying before a House Intelligence subcommittee, Webster
said many problems in the Iran-Contra affair resulted from
``officials failing to follow existing procedures and rules.'' He
said the secret operations to sell arms to Iran and to the
Nicaraguan Contras were run by National Security Council officials
who did not normally work with these procedures.
   ``Some allowance must be made for that rare case where a limited
delay in congressional notification is critical to preserve the
absolute security of an operation when, for example, lives are at
stake,'' Webster said.
   He added that the new presidential policy requires top
administration officials to re-evaluate at least every 10 days a
presidential decision to delay notification of a given finding.

<TEXT>
   China will launch a nationwide campaign to stamp
out illiteracy in five years, it was announced Wednesday.
   The goal is to raise the level of literacy of those between 15
and 40 years old to 85 percent of the rural population and 90
percent of the urban population, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported. It did not say what the levels are now.
   The literacy rate in 1987 was 80 percent nationwide, or more
than 200 million illiterates, according to earlier reports.
   The campaign is prompted by China's need to provide
better-educated and better-trained workers to carry forward the
nation's recent economic development, the State Council said.
   Anyone reading fewer than 500 characters is considered
illiterate. Literacy standards for peasants is 1,500 characters and
for industrial workers and urban residents is 2,000 characters.
This level of literacy allows them to read newspapers and simple
articles, do basic accounts and write simple essays.
   In 1949, when the communists came into power, four out of five
Chinese were illiterate. In some rural areas, entire villages were
illiterate.

<HEAD>Lay Employees to Donate Part of Salaries to Pope</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A union representing Vatican lay employees
on Wednesday announced a unique way to call attention to their
salary complaints: donating part of their pay to Pope John Paul II
to help feed the poor.
   The Association of Lay Vatican Workers, which represents about
1,500 employees, said workers next Monday would stage an ``active
strike'' for three hours at the start of each shift to protest
plans to change their pay schedule.
   The workers will do their jobs but will donate their first three
hours' pay ``directly to the Holy Father as our contribution toward
his work and in favor of those suffering from hunger in the
world,'' a union statement said.
   ``This is clearly a new type of protest,'' said union president
Mariano Cerullo. ``We felt we had to send a clear message, and the
best way was to send it directly to the pope.''
   For years the Vatican employees have complained about their
salaries, which Cerullo said range from $927 to $1,370 a month.
They are exempt from Italian taxes, work a 36-hour week and have
one month of vacation and 26 paid holidays.
   The labor action was called to protest the Vatican's plan to pay
workers at the end of each month, like most employees in Italy.
Until now, most Vitan workers have been getting their paychecks on
the first day of the month.
   The union said the change will cause hardship to the families of
the Vatican employees. Vatican officials have said the change is
primarily to facilitate administrative matters.
   The change also would affect about 1,000 religious employees of
the Vatican.
   The lay employees work at the Vatican museums, post office, main
library, the daily newspaper L'Osservatore Romano and Vatican Radio
and many offices.

   Sen. Paul Simon of Illinois said today he
would not challenge his Democratic rivals _ including Tuesday's
winners Michael Dukakis and Richard Gephardt _ in the March 8 Super
Tuesday contests but would rejoin the battle the next week.
   His announcement came one day after Dukakis and Gephardt each
notched their second victories of the campaign _ in Minnesota and
South Dakota respectively _ with Simon well back in both states.
   Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, won the New Hampshire
primary last week, and Rep. Gephardt of Missouri was the victor in
Iowa the week before.
   Simon told reporters he would bypass the primaries and caucuses
being held in 20 states on Super Tuesday because he didn't ``have
the resources for winning'' there.
   But he promised to continue his campaign in his home state and
in the primaries that follow.
   ``The campaign will begin anew after Super Tuesday, starting in
Illinois,'' Simon said.
   He spoke of ``growing evidence that for the first time in recent
history there will be no first-ballot winner at the Democratic
convention.'' And he said the primaries and caucuses on March 8
will not clear up the confusion.
   ``Super Tuesday is likely to result in a very mixed picture,''
he said.
   Dukakis and Gephardt, meanwhile, were settling in for a lengthy
slugout.
   ``This is a marathon,'' Dukakis said. ``It's going to be a long
one.''
   Each had something to crow about. The Missouri congressman
pointed to his ``great victory,'' while Dukakis gleefully noted
that Minnesota is a ``long way from Massachusetts'' _ trumpeting
the fact that he has shown vote-getting power outside his home turf.
   ``We did well in these two states which are a long way from
Massachusetts and very much in the backyard of some of the rest of
these candidates,'' Dukakis said in New York City, referring to
Gephardt and Paul Simon, the Illinois senator.
   ``Remember, I'm somebody that nobody knew in the Midwest,''
Dukakis said.
   Gephardt, in Texas, was exultant. ``It's a great victory in
South Dakota,'' he said. ``Tonight is a Gephardt night.''
   Dukakis targeted both South Dakota and Minnesota early, but
Gephardt staged a last-minute campaign blitz in South Dakota in an
effort to head off a Midwest sweep by his rival.
   With all but one precinct counted in South Dakota, Gephardt had
44 percent, followed by Dukakis at 31 percent. Trailing were
Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. at 8 percent, Simon at 6 percent,
Gary Hart and Jesse Jackson at 5 percent and 10 votes apart.
   With 74 percent of the vote in Minnesota, Dukakis had 34
percent, Jackson 20 percent, Simon 18 percent, Gephardt 7 percent,
and uncommitted 19 percent. Gore had 1 percent and Hart trailed
with just 179 votes.
   Gore and Hart had virtually ignored Minnesota.
   Gore tried to look past his dismal showings in the two states.
``We didn't focus on it,'' he said from Arkansas. ``I made it clear
from the beginning of the campaign, we're focusing on the national
primary March 8, when over 1,000 delegates will be selected.''
   Jackson, in New York City, said his Minnesota showing indicated
``we are attractive to voters in every region.'' With the scene
shifting southward, Jackson was considered well positioned for
Super Tuesday, March 8, when 20 states, mostly in the South, will
hold primaries and caucuses.
   Dukakis was the best-organized Democratic candidate in Minnesota
and spent the most money. His supporters recognized that anything
less than a victory in Minnesota would jolt his effort to prove he
could win outside the Northeast.
   Gephardt ran ads in South Dakota asserting that Dukakis knew
nothing of agriculture, recalling Dukakis' suggestion in Iowa a
year ago that frmers should turn to products such as Belgian endive
and blueberries. Dukakis countered with an ad saying that ``while
Dick Gephardt has been publicly promising to fight for you, he's
taking political action committee money from corporate insiders and
Washington lobbyists.''
   South Dakota and Minnesota Democrats bucked the national party
to hold their contests earlier than party rules allowed.
   Under a compromise worked out with South Dakota, the vote in the
Democratic primary was legally non-binding, although the results
were to help determine the allocation of delegates. A March 12
statewide caucus will apportion delegates according to the primary
results.
   Under the agreement with Minnesota, the presidential preference
poll taken at the Democratic caucuses was to be kept secret by the
party until 5 p.m. on March 8. But the state set up an independent
reporting system to gather caucus results and make them public.

   The government today banned
all political activities of the country's largest anti-apartheid
organization, the United Democratic Front, and 16 other groups in
one of its harshest crackdowns on the opposition.
   It banned several front leaders individually from working for
the organization, writing articles, giving speeches or granting
interviews. It also ordered that the main black labor federation,
the militant Congress of South African Trade Unions, limit its
activities only to labor issues and stay out of politics.
   ``The government has declared war against all peaceful
opposition,'' said Azhar Cachalia, treasurer of the United
Democratic Front and one of its few leaders not in detention. The
front represents more than 600 anti-apartheid organizations with
more than 2 million members.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace
Prize for his fight against apartheid, also said many South
Africans would see the restrictions as a ``declaration of war.''
   ``The government's idea of reform is to smash all effective
possible political opposition in the country, no matter how
peaceful and lawful, and to rule with a jackboot,'' Tutu said. He
appealed to the United States and other Western countries to
intensify economic pressure on South Africa.
   The restrictions, announced in a special government gazette, do
not technically outlaw the front and the other groups, but
effectively ban them by prohibiting them from carrying on any
activities not approved by Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok.
   The crackdown affects virtually all of the largest militant
black political groups in South Africa and appears aimed at
eliminating competition for black moderates willing to accept the
concept of white political control.
   The co-president of the United Democratic Front, Archie Gumede,
was taken away by police from his office in Durban, served with
individual banning orders and released, colleagues said. Albertina
Sisulu, the other co-president, was barred from leaving her home
between 6 p.m. and 5 a.m. and also was affected by the new orders.
   The United States, in a statement issued in Washington and
Pretoria, said it was ``appalled'' by the ban. ``By acting to
outlaw the non-violent political activity of these organizations,
the South African government dealt a severe blow to efforts to
achieve a peaceful solution to South Africa's problem. It is a
giant step backward for South Africa,'' said the statement issued
by the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria.
   Britain, the staunchest opponent of sanctions against South
Africa, condemned the crackdown. Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe said the ``oppressive'' restrictions could breed more violence.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, a co-founder of the front, said the
government had acted out of frustration because its tough tactics
during a 20-month-old state of emergency had failed to quell
militant opposition.
   ``It is not possible, really, to ban the UDF,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``The UDF is much less an organization than a
symbol of the determination of South Africa's oppressed people to
be free.''
   He said one of the government's aims was to crush organizations
that planned to call for a boycott of black municipal elections
scheduled for October. If the United Democratic Front was unable to
promote a boycott, he said, he would do so personally.
   Under the restrictions, the organizations will be permitted to
maintain bank accounts, perform administrative functions, and
undertake legal action. But no other activities will be permitted
unless authorized by Vlok.
   Several of the affected groups said they would challenge the new
orders in court.
   Vlok, who signed the order, said the regulations ``will
contribute to a climate of stability, peaceful coexistence and good
neighborliness among all population groups.''
   He said the groups affected by the regulations encouraged civil
disobedience and rebellion, advocated alternatives structures to
replace official ones, and waged campaigns of intimidation.
   Anti-apartheid activists had anticipated some type of crackdown
this year, suggesting that President P.W. Botha's National Party
government would move to blunt criticism from extreme-right white
opponents.
   The order comes exactly a week before two parliamentary
by-elections in which candidates from the far-right Conservative
Party are favored to beat National Party candidates. The
Conservatives oppose even the limited racial reforms implemented by
Botha over the past few years.
   In addition to the United Democratic Front, groups affected by
the ban include:
   _The Azanian People's Organization, the largest group espousing
the black consciousness philosophy pioneered by Steve Biko, an
activist who died in police custody in 1977.
   _The National Education Crisis Committee, which has sought to
promote ``people's education'' in which black communities would
exercise greater control over their schools.
   _The Detainees Parents Support Committee, which monitors
detentions and provides support for relatives of people detained
without charge.
   _The Soweto Civic Assoiciation, the main anti-apartheid
community group in the country's largest black township and a key
factor behind the rent boycott which has persisted there for nearly
two years.
   Other affected groups include local and regional youth and
community organizations and the Release Mandela Committee, a group
which campaigns for the release of jailed African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela.
   The black trade union congress, known as COSATU, said Vlok's
order ``has turned the clock back to the days of absolute control
and no democracy.''
   ``The order demonstrates that the government is completely
incompetent,'' said COSATU's spokesman, Frank Meintjies. ``The end
result is going to be conflict, fear and uncertainty.''
   The country's 5 million whites control the government and
economy and maintain segregated living areas, schools and
hospitals. The 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs.

   Republican senators reacted angrily today
after U.S. Capitol police seized Sen. Robert Packwood and carried
him to the Senate floor _ feet first _ to answer a quorum call
during an all-night filibuster over campaign financing legislation.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said the parliamentary arrest of
Packwood by Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Henry Guigni and five
plainclothes Capitol policemen was ``demeaning and pointless.''
   Packwood was treated like a ``common criminal ... brought
forcefully to the floor of the United States Senate,'' said Specter.
   But several Republican senators actually ran away from police to
avoid arrest, said Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.
   ``Senators went off in a dead sprint. They should have been in
Calgary in one of the Olympic events,'' he said. ``The spectacle of
a United States senator running from the sergeant-at-arms in order
to keep from being compelled to attend a session of the United
States Senate is an outrage.''
   Packwood's spokesman, Bob Witeck, said the Oregon Republican
re-injured a broken hand, which has been in a cast the last two
weeks, when the police entered his office with a passkey. Witeck
said that Packwood went to a hospital early today to have X-rays
taken but that no new breaks were found.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Packwood's arm was ``severely
jostled and hurt'' by ``Banana Republic'' tactics.
   ``When a senator is locked in his own chamber, I question
whether it is constitutionally sound to break into his office and
force him out of his office and carry him to the floor,'' Hatch
said.
   Packwood's spokesman said the senator ``tried to hold the door
closed with his shoulder, but they were able to push it open.''
   ``I had to take him in,'' siad Guigni, a one-time Honolulu
motorcycle and vice officer. ``I knew he was not going in under his
own power.''
   Guigni said Packwood walked with the detectives to the Capitol,
but made it clear he would not walk into the chamber. ``We picked
him up in the elevator'' and carried him to his desk, Guigni said.
   The motion to arrest absent senators was made by Senate Majority
Leader Robert Byrd of West Virginia and was approved on a 45-3 roll
call vote, with Democratic senators Dennis DeConcini of Arizona,
Howell Heflin of Alabama and Richard Shelby of Alabama voting no.
Specter said the actual warrants were signed by Sen. Brock Adams,
D-Wash.
   Senate officials said the arrest was the first since Democratic
senators Burnet Rhett Maybank of South Carolina and Lister Hill of
Alabama were compelled to come to the floor in 1942.
   Packwood, a leader of GOP opposition to a Democratic campaign
finance bill, was brought in by four officers under terms of an
unusual motion approved through late Tuesday by the majority
Democrats.
   The Democrats, who were forcing the Republicans to wage the
filibuster in an effort to subdue the GOP opposition to the
Democrats' proposed limits on campaign spending and contributions
from political action committees, employed the rarely used
procedure to require absent members to answer quorum bells or face
arrest.
   Republicans had been taking turns holding the floor to prevent
the Democrats from bringing the bill to a vote they can win. This
upset the Democrats, who had been forced to stay close to the
chamber, maintain a quorum and keep the Senate in session.
   When most Republicans stopped answering quorum calls, the
Democrats resorted to ordering Guigni to scour the hallways and
offices and arrest absent senators. He carried warrants for each of
the 46 Republicans.
   Packwood was found in his Russell Building office, Guigni said.
   ``I had to shove in a door to get into his office,'' Guigni
said. ``I think he hurt his finger. He was very courteous.''
   Packwood was not available for immediate comment.
   Some 13 hours after the filibuster began, the two sides called a
truce of sorts. Republicans would continue to talk, but there would
be no more quorum calls until 10 a.m., giving most members a chance
to sleep.
   As dawn broke, Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., wound up an hour
of holding the floor, speaking against the bill in a steady,
conversational tone.
   ``I've immensely enjoyed this, particularly at this time of day.
There's nothing I'd rather be doing,'' Durenberger said as turned
control of the floor over to Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I.
   Durenberger spoke to an almost-empty chamber. Freshman Sen. Kent
Conrad, D-N.D., sat at the podium, while Sen. Wendell Ford, D-Ky.,
represented the Democratic side of the aisle.
   Eight teen-aged pages sat quietly on the carpeted steps leading
to the podium and a few detectives sat in the otherwise empty
gallery.
   The ``full-fledged filibuster'' was formally proclaimed by
Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., on Tuesday after Republicans
had done for five days what they had done for 22 days last year _
prevent a vote on the Democrats' campaign spending bill.
   Byrd has the votes to pass the bill, which would set voluntary
spending limits for Senate general elections. But he is still about
five votes short of the 60 he needs to shut off debate and force a
roll call.
   Early today, Democrats filed a cloture petition, which probably
will be considered on Friday.
   Republicans, who last year beat Byrd on a record seven cloture
votes, say the proposed system to curb escalating campaign spending
would prevent them from gaining seats in heavily Democratic states.
   Dove said the filibuster is the chamber's first knock-down test
of attrition since a nine-day battle in 1960 over civil rights
legislation.
   Four senators from each camp have been negotiating since last
week, trying to find a compromise. They say they have found some
common ground on issues such as better disclosure of money going to
political paries and forcing broadcasters to offer rock-bottom ad
rates to candidates.
   But they report nothing but disagreement over limiting campaign
spending, which has risen from $600,000 for the average Senate race
in 1976 to $3 million in 1986, with a big-state race often topping
$10 million.
   The chief GOP negotiator, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said
Republicans were willing to discuss a compromise on another
Democratic demand: putting a ceiling on how much money a candidate
can get from political action committees.
   The Democrats' bill would establish voluntary spending limits,
ranging from $950,000 to $5.5 million, depending on a state's
population.
   A candidate observing the limit would get campaign funds from
the Treasury if the opponent exceeded the limit or an independent
group spent large amounts of money against the candidate.
   The Republicans would have some limits on individual PAC
contributions while strengthening campaign-finance disclosure
requirements and opposing spending limits.

   Federal Trade Commission member Terry Calvani
escaped a contempt of Congress citation Wednesday by turning over
documents demanded by a congressional panel, but he said he felt he
had become a scapegoat in a turf fight between two congressmen.
   Calvani had been subpoenaed to appear before the House Committee
on Energy and Commerce's subcommittee on oversight and
investigations because he had refused to turn over some internal
FTC documents sought by the panel concerning unfair advertising
practices by the airline industry.
   He told the panel that the subcommittee's insistence on
obtaining internal advisory documents ``represents a very poor
development in the exercise of this subcommittee's oversight
reponsibilities over the Federal Trade Commission.''
   Calvani said that ``violation of the confidence between a
commissioner and his or her personal attorney-advisers makes
government less efficient.''
   ``I tell the men and women that serve in my office that I want
their wholly candid assessment and unvarnished recommendation about
matters before me,'' Calvani said. Due to the subcommittee's
insistence on access to internal documents, he said, ``This morning
I have instructed my staff that from henceforth they should not
commit their work to paper.''
   He said that until Friday, the panel had not provided the legal
justification for him to provide the documents and said he could
not test the legality of the demand without being willing to stand
criminal trial.
   ``To my knowledge this Kafka-esque mode of operations is unique
in our system of justice,'' Calvani said.
   After his appearance, Calvani said he believed he had become
caught in a ``turf fight'' between panel Chairman John D. Dingell,
D-Mich., and Rep. James J. Howard, D-N.J., chairman of the
Committee on Public Works and Transportation.
   ``I'm the pawn,'' he said. ``They were looking for a scapegoat,
and I'm the unfortunate person chosen for that.''
   Subcommittee counsel Patrick McLain refused to comment on
Calvani's allegation. Dingell's office referred all request for
comment to McLain.
   At issue were internal documents concerning the FTC's views on
whether unfair and deceptive advertising practices were occurring
in the airline industry.
   A letter on the matter from the FTC to the National Association
of Attorneys General indicated that the agency had not studied the
matter, but a press release on the report indicated that the agency
believed there was no problem with the airline industry's practices.
   A reference to the press release comment, included in a story by
The Washington Post, was read on the House floor last October and
helped defeat an amendment by Dingell that would have transferred
responsibility for oversight for consumer protection regarding the
airline industry from the Department of Transportation to the FTC,
McLain said.
   The subcommittee began asking the FTC for internal documents on
the matter several days later. Two commissioners said they had no
such documents, two others allowed subcommittee staff to read
pertinent materials in their offices, but Calvani refused to
provide access to such documents.
   After several letters back and forth between the subcommittee
and Calvani, who was insisting on the legal justification for the
demand, the panel on Feb. 4 subpoenaed Calvani to appear and bring
the documents.

<HEAD>Subway Gunman Changing Lawyer in Civil Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Subway gunman Bernhard Goetz is looking for a
new lawyer to handle his defense against civil suits seeking a
total of $63 million for three of the four youths he shot,
according to one of his attorneys.
   Goetz decided to break with Joseph Kelner, the attorney he had
hired for the civil cases, because of ``differences of viewpoint,''
said Mark Baker, who with Barry Slotnick last year won acquittal
for Goetz on the most serious criminal charges stemming from the
shooting.
   Published reports quoted Kelner as saying he was withdrawing
from the case because Goetz was not cooperating.
   Goetz was convicted of weapon possession but acquitted of
attempted murder, assault and reckless endangerment in the Dec. 22,
1984, subway shooting of four young men. Goetz, who is white, said
he feared the black youths were going to rob him.
   Two of the youths brought civil actions for $5 million and $8.5
million, while lawyers for Darrell Cabey, brain-damaged and
paralyzed by the shooting, seek $50 million. Cabey's lawyers say
the shooting was racist and ``wrongful retaliation for past
injury'' Goetz had suffered at the hands of others.

   Tulsa (Okla.) World on Jimmy Swaggart:
   Jimmy Swaggart's tearful confession of sin _ presumably sexual
misconduct _ was greeted with immediate forgiveness by many of his
followers Sunday.
   Some of his parishioners went beyond mere charity. They praised
Swaggart for his admission. (``It took a man to do that.'')
   The reaction of the public is likely to be less tolerant.
Swaggart's confession reportedly came only after he was confronted
with photographs showing him entering a motel room with a
prostitute.
   The so-called ``Pearly Gate'' scandals vary in some ways, but
there seems to be one common rule: If you get caught, confess and
ask forgiveness _ but only if you get caught.

   Charleston (W.Va.) Dail Mail on U.S. support of Contras:
   Democratic leaders in Congress hooted when President Reagan
wanted to give military aid to the Nicaraguan Contras in case the
peace process broke down in Central America.
   They should now send the same message to the Marxist regime in
Nicaragua.
   With the Contras out of the way, Sandinista-backed warriors have
picked up the pace of their battles elsewhere.
   Americans who decry Contra involvement in the deaths of
Nicaraguans might also find time to mourn victims of the
Sandinista-backed Marxist guerrillas in El Salvador.
   Reagan's plan to keep the Contra movement alive, as a check on
the Sandinistas, was prudent and necessary.

   The Times Record, Brunswick, Maine, on filing tax returns early:
   The head of the Internal Revenue Service is worried by a trend
among many taxpayers to delay filing their federal tax returns.
   According to IRS Commissioner Lawrence Gibbs, five years ago 14
percent of all individual returns were filed in January and 34
percent in April. Last year, only 4 percent were filed in January
and almost 40 percent in April.
   Gibbs told a Senate Finance subcommittee that the trend, if
exacerbated by the 1986 tax reform law, could pose big problems for
the IRS.
   That's because the government is obligated to pay interest on
refunds whenever returns are not processed within a 45-day period
after April 15.
   He's unlikely to generate much sympathy among taxpayers with
that complaint. ...
   The IRS ought to be glad that every taxpayer does not wait until
April 15 to file.

   Baltimore Sun on President Reagan's budget:
   For the first time in years, President Reagan has sent Congress
a budget that wasn't immediately dismissed as dead on arrival.
   The $1.1 trillion budget for 1989 ... has been received on
Capitol Hill as his most realistic spending plan.
   The note of realism injected into this year's spending proposal
reflects the two-year budget agreement Reagan reached with Congress
last year, after the stock market crash brought home the drastic
need for deficit reduction.
   It reflects the politics of this year, an election year in which
the president lacks the kind of muscle needed to push through
daring new proposals.
   And it reflects the constraints imposed by huge deficits, which
rose to record levels during the Reagan years.

   Los Angeles Daily News on Oscar non-nominations:
   Yes, we'll probably be seated in front of our sets on April 11,
tuned in to watch the Academy Awards.
   But that doesn't mean something won't be missing: Once again the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has snubbed director
Steven Spielberg.
   This time Spielberg's ``Empire of the Sun'' failed to be
nominated for Best Picture and Spielberg's name was conspicuously
absent from the Best Director category.
   Of course it's the academy's right to make its own nominations.
But it's too bad that Hollywood's elite has chosen repeatedly to
ignore Spielberg, who has captivated the country as few other
living directors have done. ...
   Spielberg has the talent to make American film classics that
will entertain young and old for generations.
   Perhaps that's too much talent to bring him recognition from his
peers.

   Farmington (N.M.) Daily Times on President Reagan's budget:
   President Reagan has submitted a $1.1 trillion federal budget to
Congress for the fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1.
   Reagan campaigned for the presidency eight years ago with a
promise to ``balance the federal budget.''
   He has failed to provide the kind of leadership that would
encourage Congress to act in a fiscally responsible fashion.
   As a result, we can expect annual budgets of more than $1
trillion and continued growth of the national debt, now somewhere
around $2.5 trillion.
   To the millions of taxpayers who had looked to Reagan to clamp
down on the big spenders in Washington, his two terms in the White
House have been a dismal failure.

   Reading (Pa.) Eagle on Social Security:
   Is Social Security strictly a retirement account, or is it an
annuity that takes effect when a participant reaches age 65 and is
eligible for full benefits, or reaches age 62 and is eligible for
reduced benefits?
   That's the argument that has flared in Washington once again as
the effort is launched to eliminate the $8,400 a year earnings cap.
   Those who support the proposal ... argue that (the cap) punishes
the elderly.
   Critics insist the original intent of Social Security was to
provide income after retirement. They tread on uncertain grounds,
however, when they bring up the matter of the original intent of
Social Security.
   Original intent ... was changed in a wholesale manner by ...
revisions: A notable example of that is that widows of farmers who
never paid Social Security taxes were granted benefits.
   Also, ... the earnings cap ends at age 70. If earnings are a
factor between the ages of 65 and 70, why not after 70?
   Repeal of the earnings cap is clearly in the public interest.

   At first it seemed too reprehensible to be true. At this

to believe a report that Israeli soldiers had severely beaten four
Palestinian youths and then buried them alive using a bulldozer.
   The allegation, it turns out, is fact.
   The youths, who were dug out by villagers after the soldiers
left the scene in the West Bank village of Kfar Salem, all
surivived. ... The youths were being ``punished'' for participating
in disturbances.
   Even Israelis who have supported the government's policy of
``force, might and beatings'' to quell Palestinian unrest in the
occupied territories were stunned by the news reports on the
incident. ...
   Israel is going to have to make a choice. It will have to choose
between continuing an indefensible policy of repression in the
occupied areas, or taking steps to address the legitimate
grievances of more than 500,000 Palestinians living under Israeli
control.
   Israel's future as a nation of democratic ideals depends on the
outcome.

   The American Association of Blood Banks
announced Wednesday it is studying new screening techniques that
may further reduce the chances of the AIDS virus being transmitted
through blood donations.
   The AABB said the new study was prompted by reports that ``have
raised concerns about the safety of blood transfusions administered
to over 4 million people in the United States annually.''
   The AABB cited a study published Feb. 25 in the New England
Journal of Medicine which traced 13 units of blood infected by the
AIDS virus back to seven people who donated blood even though they
had been recently exposed to the virus.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a fatal disease
caused by the human immunodeficiency virus. It is spread most often
through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers,
infected blood or blood products, and from infected pregnant women
to their offspring.
   Donated blood is routinely tested for the HIV virus, but the
tests are able only to detect antibodies which may not develop
until long after the exposure to the virus. The AABB said its study
will test for the HIV antigen, a marker that may appear in the
blood of an infected person before the antibodies.
   ``The results of this study will determine if an antigen test
would be useful in detecting individuals in early stages of
infection who donate blood,'' the statement said. It added that
there are currently no tests for the antigen that have been
licensed.
   Dr. Paul J. Schmidt, the AABB president, said current tests are
``nearly'' 99 percent sensitive, but do not detect people recently
exposed to HIV.
   ``We expected that there would be some infection developing in
transfusion recipients,'' he said. ``We are working on solutions to
the problem of detecting persons even earlier iln this infectious
state, and on how to discourage them from donating blood.''
   Schmidt added: ``The risk from not getting a needed transfusion
is infinitely greater than the risk of getting one.''
   The federal Centers for Disease Control estimates that at least
12,000 Americans have been infected by the AIDS virus from
transfusions given before rigorous blood-screening programs were
adopted that reduced the presence of the virus in blood supplies to
less than one unit in 50,000.
   As of Feb. 15, AIDS had been diagnosed in 53,814 Americans, of
whom more than half, or 30,158, have died since 1981, according to
the CDC. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.
   AIDS kills by destroying the immune system, leaving patients
susceptible to opportunistic infections which often prove fatal.
   Blood banks now screen donor candidates for AIDS risk factors,
but the AABB said it would review these procedures to determine if
they should be tightened.
   The AABB is the world's largest organization of blood banks and
transfusion services, with 2,500 members. It accredits blood banks
and transfusion services and sets standards for agencies collecting
nearly half the nation's donated blood.

   Bryan-College Station (Texas) Eagle on President Reagan's budget:
   Ronald Reagan is going down in history as the country's biggest
spendthrift president. He has put the nation in hock to the hilt,
and mortgaged the future of our children and their children.
   The budget he presented to Congress last week raised the
national debt to $2.5 trillion _ a figure that has doubled during
his administration. Interest payments alone cost $140 billion a
year. ...
   To be sure, the president has had lots of help getting us into
all this trouble. It was only with the help of a spineless Congress
that he was able to borrow vast sums to finance his massive defense
buildup and to offset revenues lost in his tax-cutting programs.
   The next president simply must force the country to face the
fact that we can't continue spending money we don't have.
   With all the presidential candidates whistling Dixie this month,
voters would be wise to listen closely for who is sounding the
clear notes on this issue.

   The News Tribune, Woodbridge, N.J., on the verdict in the Amtrak
crash:
   Sixteen people died, scores were injured, and tens of millions
of dollars worth of damage was done when a Conrail engineer ran his
locomotive through a stop sign and plowed into an Amtrak passenger
train. The engineer tested positive for marijuana use.
   After he pleaded guilty to one count of manslaughter, he was
given a maximum sentence of five years in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Unless he had been hiding in a cave, Rick Gates knew what
marijuana could do to the senses. Gates also had to know the damage
a misguided train could cause.
   So what was the message? Sixteen dead passengers equals five
years maximum, which doesn't sound like much of a deterrent to us.

   The Duluth (Minn.) News-Tribune on the 1990 census:
   Let's conduct a census and count everybody but Swedes ... or
maybe Irish ... or Americans who migrate with the seasons ... or
some other identifiable population group.
   Why do that? To fix the outcome, silly. What other reason could
there be?
   A coalition of congressional members wants to do that in 1990
when the Constitution says the country must conduct a decennial
head count.
   About 40 House members want to count everyone but illegal aliens
and will sue the Census Bureau to force the exclusion. It is
estimated there are about 2 million illegal aliens in the United
States.
   Why do these members of Congress want to ignore illegal aliens?
To fix the outcome of the 1990 census, of course.
   The national head count is used to distribute seats in the House
of Representatives, and they fear aliens will cause unfair shifts
from one state to another.
   To their credit, census officials say they read the Constitution
to say everyone must be counted (``the whole number of persons'').
   Of course, everyone should be included.

Tuesday primaries and caucuses because he does ``not have the
resources for winning'' them.
   But the Illinois Democrat said he was not dropping out of the
race and would continue to campaign to win his home state primary
on March 15 and the contests in the states that follow.
   ``The campaign will begin anew after Super Tuesday, starting in
Illinois,'' Simon told a news conference.
   Simon was dealt a crippling blow Tuesday when he finished far
behind Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis and was trailing Jesse
Jackson in Minnesota's caucuses. He came in a distant fourth in the
South Dakota primary behind Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri,
Dukakis and Albert Gore Jr.
   Last week after coming in third in the New Hampshire primary,
Simon said he would withdraw if he did not finish first in either
Minnesota or South Dakota. He later backed off that statement.
   Faced with primaries and caucuses in 20 states and American
Samoa on March 8, Simon said he cannot raise the money to match the
big warchests of Dukakis and Gore in the region.
   ``There is no sense in my fooling myself,'' the Illinois
Democrat said. ``We just don't have the money.''
   His campaign plunged into debt before the New Hampshire primary,
but he has been talking of close to half a million dollars gathered
in the past two weeks.
   ``We have had record-breaking fund-raising,'' Simon declared.
``Monday, for example, $137,000 came in. We never had a day like
that before. But you take $137,000 and then look at 20 states and
what it would cost for a media buy, and you're talking about
something that is nowhere near adequate.''
   Simon also said he had made the judgment that March 8 will not
settle the race and that the battle for the 1988 Democratic
presidential nomination will go to the convention in Atlanta in
July.
   ``Super Tuesday is likely to result in a very mixed picture,''
he said. ``Phase one of the selection process ends on March 8. ...
But we do not have the resources for winning in the Super Tuesday
states.''
   ``Phase two of the selection process begins March 15. I shall
use phase two to deliver the message that we must become a nation
with leadership characterized by compassion and vision and common
sense. It is on to Atlanta with that message.''
   Simon is on the ballot in all the Super Tuesday primaries, but
he said he will do little or no campaigning in those states _
except for the nationally televised debates that are a major
feature of the next two weeks.
   ``I'm not writing off the South. I want my friends there to vote
for me,'' he said. ``I'm realistic about resources. I simply cannot
do everything.''
   Dukakis and Gephardt have split the four major Democratic
contests so far. And Simon said he had concluded the party will not
have a certain winner going into the Atlanta convention.
   He cited ``growing evidence that for the first time in recent
history there will be no first-ballot winner at the Democratic
convention.''
   Simon's best day so far was in Iowa on Feb. 8, where he finished
a very close second to Gephardt. He was third in New Hampshire.
   He talked to reporters after a speech to the United Auto Workers
at a Washington hotel.

<HEAD>Southern Republics Have Long Posed Ethnic Problems for Kremlin</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Kremlin's attempt to bring 100 nationalities
under one communist umbrella has been difficult in the southern
Caucasus Mountain region, where dozens of ethnic groups strive to
assert their identity far from the seat of Soviet power.
   About 50 different nationalities have been identified in the
Caucasus area, some represented only by a few thousand individuals
largely isolated amid the remote mountain valleys. The main peoples
of the region are the Azeris, Georgians and Armenians, all of whom
have their own Soviet republics.
   Armenians drew attention this week because of demonstrations in
their capital, Yerevan, and in a small adjoining area that is part
of Azerbaidzhan. Thousands of demonstrators in Yerevan demanded
that the area, the Nagorno-Karabakh region, be made part of Armenia.
   Nagorno-Karabakh is a microcosm of the inconsistencies of Soviet
nationality policy. Its population of 157,000 was 81 percent
Armenian and just 18 percent Azeri, but the region was made part of
Azerbaidzhan in 1923 after having been deeded to Armenia when it
became part of the Soviet Union in 1920.
   The Caucasus residents tend to be fiercely independent,
bristling at attempts by the Soviet Union's dominant ethnic group,
the Russians, to interfere with their languages, customs and
religions.
   In Armenia, the most bitter fuel to nationalist passions
occurred while Turkey controlled western Armenia in 1915. More than
a million Armenians are believed to have died or been massacred
when Turkey deported the local population.
   Other Armenian nationalism stems from religious beliefs, which
are discouraged by the Communist Party government. Patriarch Vazgen
I of the Armenian Church said in an interview at church
headquarters in Etchmiadzin last year that the majority of
Armenians are believers and that more than half of newborns are
christened.
   The region's turmoil has led many Armenians to leave their
homeland, settling principally either in other parts of the Soviet
Union or in the United States. Armenian emigration to the United
States approaches 1,000 per month.
   To the north, Georgians say they have been more successful than
their Caucasus neighbors at resisting ``russification'' because
they tend to stick close to home, limiting assimilation. But
Georgian students protested by the thousands in 1979 when the
republic's government tried to change the official language to
Russian.
   Georgians' spirit of independence is reflected in their business
dealings. They are known for doing a brisk business growing produce
in Georgia's Mediterranean-like climate and selling them in areas
where supply is scare.
   Azerbaidzhan's wealth traditionally was the oil found in its
capital, Baku, on the Caspian Sea. But oil production has dropped,
causing economic problems in the republic.
   Ethnic tensions have surfaced in areas of Azerbaidzhan with
large populations of Armenians. In addition to Nagorno-Karabakh,
demonstrators have also asserted Armenian national rights in the
village of Chardakhlu. The village was the scene in October of a
clash between native Azeris and long-time Armenian residents.
   There also is a sizable Moslem population in Azerbaidzhan, which
is officially tolerated by the Kremlin but serves as yet another
wedge between the republic's people and the Russian-dominated
Moscow government.

<TEXT>
   Given the choice, more than one out
of every four West German women would ditch their husband before
giving up their best friend, a magazine survey said Wednesday.
   A survey by the Journal for Women magazine also reported that
86.5 percent of the women asked said they willingly accepted
criticisms from their best female friends.
   According to the magazine, 26 percent of the women surveyed said
they would give up their husbands before their best female friends.
   But in the end the men won out, with 71 percent of the women
saying they would give up their best friends to keep their
husbands, while three percent were undecided, the magazine said.
   The Hamburg-based magazine did not say how many women took part
in the survey.

   About 100 Hampshire College students
occupied a dormitory office for a second day in a protest over
racism and marched across campus today to present a list of 12
demands to the college president.
   The group then withdrew to the Dakin House office they seized
Tuesday morning and said they did not plan to meet again with
president Adele Simmons until 9 a.m. Thursday.
   The protesters deliberately delayed negotiations, said Penny
Predmas, a junior from New York City.
   ``We are building our sense of our community, so we can feel
invincible,'' she said.
   The protesters were escorted across campus by about 100
students, who snaked through a classroom building and a building
housing administrative offices chanting, ``One, two, three, four.
Racism has got to go.''
   Among the protesters' demands were additional library materials
dealing with Third World nations, establishment of a college policy
on racial harassment, a full-time adviser for minority students, a
permanent meeting place for non-white students, a minority
recruitment week each semester, and no retaliatory actions against
the protesters.
   About a dozen white supporters pitched tents and staged an
overnight vigil outside Dakin House, and students from nearby
Amherst, Mount Holyoke and Smith colleges as well as the University
of Massachusetts joined the demonstraters this morning.
   A week ago about 125 minority students at the University of
Massachusetts began a six-day occupation at a building there.
   ``The problems are the same, although the sizes of the minority
communities are different,'' said Hampshire freshman Anita Fearman
of Los Angeles.
   ``There's a general feeling here that we've been more or less
pushed under the rug,'' said Ms. Fearman, who is black.
   Although there have been racial attacks at the University of
Massachusetts, there have been none at Hampshire, which lists 100
minority students among its 1,100 undergraduates. But minorities
complained of verbal harassment and a lack of attention to Third
World issues.
   ``We have been to the administration several times over the past
three years with our demands and concerns and nothing has been
done,'' Premdas said. ``It's been all lip service. It seemed this
was the only way to get something done.''

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Wednesday by the Supreme Court.
   
   FALWELL-HUSTLER
   
   The court overturned a $200,000 award won by evangelist Jerry
Falwell against Hustler magazine and its publisher Larry Flynt,
extending the legal protections for parody and satire, even when
they are pornographic.
   The court unanimously ruled that even pornographic spoofs about
a public figure enjoy the free-speech protections of the
Constitution's First Amendment if those spoofs could not reasonably
have been interpreted as stating actual facts about the person.
   The case is Hustler vs. Falwell, 86-1278.
   
   RENT CONTROLS
   
   The court expanded the power of communities to impose rent
controls, ruling that hardships to tenants may be considered when
landlords seek rent increases.
   By a 6-2 vote, the justices upheld a San Jose, Calif., ordinance
that has been attacked as a ``Robin Hood'' law that steals from the
rich to pay the poor.
   The case is Pennell vs. San Jose, 86-753.
   
   ENTRAPMENT
   
   The court broadened protection for criminal defendants who claim
they were enticed by law enforcement officials into committing a
crime.
   By a 6-2 vote, the justices overturned a bribery conviction
against Frederick Mathews of Milwaukee, Wis., a former Small
Business Administration official.
   The case is Mathews vs. U.S., 86-6109.
   
   DEFENDANT'S TESTIMONY
   
   The court made it a bit easier for prosecutors to talk to
criminal trial juries about a defendant's failure to testify.
   In splintered voting, the court reinstated the mail fraud
conviction of a man who prosecutors say set his tennessee home
afire so he could file a false insurance claim.
   The case is U.S. vs. Robinson, 86-937.
   
   DEFAULT JUDGMENT
   
   The court bolstered the right default-judgment losers have to
challenge a judgment entered after they fail to respond to a
lawsuit.
   The justices unanimously ruled for a Houston businessman in his
challenge of a default judgment awarded against him six years ago
for a $5,000 debt owed to a medical center.
   The case is Peralta vs. Heights Medical Center, 86-1430.
   
   LAWYERS FEES
   
   The court ruled that federal judges lack authority to order the
government to pay fees to lawyers who successfully obtain overdue
federal welfare for poor people who are aged, blin or disabled.
   The 8-0 ruling in a case from Arkansas held that federal
officials are not required by law to withhold a portion of a
recipient's benefits to pay the attorney.
   The case is Bowen vs. Galbreath, 86-1146.

   Angry Palestinians today lynched an Arab who
they apparently suspected of collaborating with the Israelis,
stringing him up on a utility pole after he went on a shooting
spree that killed a 4-year-old boy and wounded 13 other people,
security sources said.
   Israel radio called the incident in a West Bank village ``a
serious escalation'' of the unrest in the occupied territories and
linked it to the Palestine Liberation Organization's calls to deal
with collaborators.
   The dead man's identity was not immediately known.
   Details were sketchy concerning the incident in Qabatiye, near
Jenin, 60 miles north of Jerusalem. However, Israel radio said the
violence began when hundreds of residents marched to the man's
house, threw firebombs and setting it afire.
   Security sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
man shot into the crowd, which apparently suspected him of
collaborating with Israeli authorities, killing the boy and
wounding the others.
   Israel radio said the crowd then dragged the man away and hanged
him. Security sources confirmed the report.
   An army spokesman said soldiers arrived after the hanging.
According to the United Nations, 63 Arabs have been killed, most by
soldiers, since the wave of unrest began Dec. 8 in the occupied
territories.
   A general strike gripped the West Bank and Gaza Strip today as
businesses shut down and Arab workers stayed home in response to a
call for stepped up protests before Secretary of State George P.
Shultz arrives.
   Also today, the army reported what it said may be the first
armed attack against the military in the past 2{ months of unrest
in the territories seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
   An army spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
bomb exploded on a road near Gaza as a vehicle was passing Tuesday
night and shots were fired. There were no injuries.
   Extra-tight security arrangements went into effect today at Ben
Gurion airport in advance of Shultz's arrival Thursday. Airport
police said riot police units were called in and will stay on duty
through Tuesday as Shultz conducts his shuttle mission in the
Middle East.
   In the Gaza Strip today, few people were on the streets and only
one or two cars were seen moving. Most Arab laborers stayed away
from their jobs in Israel, there was little public transport, and
there were reports of a few scattered tire-burning and
stone-throwing incidents.
   Much of the West Bank was dusted white with a thin layer of snow
that fell overnight and some Arab youths in a Jerusalem
neighborhood threw snowballs at passing cars, a relief from the
stone-throwing of previous days.
   Business was at a standstill today. There was little traffic and
few workers left home, according to army radio.
   The underground National Leadership of the Uprising, in leaflets
distributed throughout the territories, called for a general strike
today and Thursday.
   Shultz is coming to Israel to launch a new peace initiative he
hopes will put an end to the violence of past weeks, bring the
Arabs and Israelis to the negotiating table and eventually achieve
an overall solution to the Mideast conflict.
   The secretary of state has acknowledged he has only a slim
chance of accomplishing that goal during his visit. The Shultz
initiative, which includes trading territory for peace, is likely
to encounter opposition from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud
Bloc.
   Deputy Prime Minister David Levy, interviewed on army radio,
said on Tuesday the new initiative contradicts the 10-year-old Camp
David agreement.
   ``There is confusion in it and an attempt to sell it to Israel
as Camp David and to sell it to the Arabs that will give them
almost all of the West Bank and Gaza,'' he said.
   The PLO has prohibited local Palestinians from meeting Shultz.
Fayez Abu Rahme, a Gaza lawyer who was among a group of Arabs who
met with a U.S. official on Saturday, said: ``As far as we are
concerned there won't be a meeting.''
   David Good, spokesman for the U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem, said
he did not know if Palestinians will meet with Shultz.
   Informed U.S. sources said Shultz would not meet with
Palestinians outside Jerusalem. ``We're not taking directions from
the PLO on how to meet with Palestinians,'' said the source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.

   President Reagan's proposed cuts in programs
to help the poor keep warm in the winter and cool in the summer
will cause ``pain, stress and homelessness,'' a congressional
report said Wednesday.
   A proposed $518.3 million cut in federal energy assistance for
the poor in Reagan's fiscal 1989 budget would drop to 13 percent
the eligible heating and cooling expenses covered by the program,
which provides assistance to 6.7 million households, Rep. Howard
Wolpe, D-Mich., said in releasing the study by the Northeast
Midwest Institute.
   In 1981, the year Reagan took office, federal energy assistance
for the poor covered nearly 25 percent of eligible heating and
cooling expenses, Wolpe said.
   ``The considerable erosion of federal support is all the more
shocking considering the fact that `eligible costs' represent only
about 40 percent of a recipient's energy bill,'' Wolpe said.
   The declining funding for the program, an outgrowth of the oil
crises of the 1970s, comes amid a background of rising energy
costs, the study said.
   In 1981 the nation spent $7.47 billion on heating and cooling,
and in 1988 the cost likely will be $9.67 billion, the study said.
   ``Many poor families in this country are threatened with the
loss of their home heating and other basic utility services because
they cannot afford to pay their bills,'' the study said. ``As a
visible result, the nation's poor experience a high level of pain,
stress and homelessness.''
   The program ``is grossly and tragically underfunded,'' said Sen.
John Heinz, R-Pa., the co-chairman of the coalition. ``Both the
administration and the Congress are to blame _ the administration
for failing to honor its long-stated commitment to the safety net,
and Congress for acquiescing.''
   Heinz and Wolpe said they oped to stave off further cuts in the
program and to roll back last year's 16 percent reduction in
funding.
   The institute is a policy group formed by senators and
representatives from the Northeast and Midwest.

   Mayor Tom Young is asking a federal judge
to order former mayor Lee Alexander and the people who bribed him
to pay $1.5 million in restitution to the city.
   In a letter to U.S. District Judge Thomas A. McAvoy and U.S.
Probation Officer Frank Waterson, Young asked that the city be
named a victim of Alexander's extortion-kickback scheme in the
pre-sentence report now being prepared.
   If that request is rejected, the city may sue Alexander and five
or more local businessmen who paid bribes for city contracts, Young
said Tuesday.
   ``If your household was robbed of cash and valuable jewels and
the thieves were found, along with some of the loot they stole,
who'd receive the stolen cash and jewels? Obviously the owner of
the home,'' Young said.
   ``I'm head of the household. We're requesting that what's been
stolen from this household be returned to it.''
   Waterson declined to comment specifically about the Alexander
case, but he said consideration of restitution to the victim of any
crime is a matter commonly brought up during sentencing.
   Alexander and nine others who pleaded guilty to federal charges
of racketeering, tax evasion and conspiracy will be sentenced March
10 and 11. The charges stemmed from a probe by the FBI and Internal
Revenue Service into corruption during Alexander's tenure as mayor
from 1970 to 1986.
   ``The administration believes the city was a victim, and we're
doing the best we can to recover as much of the assets as
possible,'' said Syracuse Corporation Counsel Frank Harrigan.
   The city is asking for a portion of the money Alexander has
returned to the federal government, as well as restitution from the
ex-mayor and his associates, Harrigan said.
   Alexander already has surrendered $1.4 million in cash, bonds
and coins to the federal government.
   The ex-mayor could be sentenced up to 30 years in prison, but
the U.S. Attorney will recommend a term of 10 years.
   Federal authorities have said they will administer a lie
detector test to Alexander next week to determine if he is
withholding any other illegally gained assets.

<TEXT>
   The nation's record trade deficit began to
shrink in the final three months of 1987 as U.S. exports climbed 6
percent to record levels, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.
   While narrowing just $200 million from the summer, the decline
of the trade deficit to $40.2 billion on a balance-of-payments
basis marked the first quarterly improvement since the spring of
1986.
   ``We have a genuine export boom going on and I think a lot of
people are are pleasantly surprised,'' said Robert Ortner,
undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs.
   Ortner said further improvements were likely in the months ahead
at present levels of the dollar, which he said appears to have
stabilized in foreign exchange markets.
   Still, the year finished with a record $159.3 billion
balance-of-payments trade deficit for all of 1987, the report said.
   In terms of volume alone, the trade deficit actually showed a 5
percent improvement from 1986 to 1987. The fact that import prices
rose more rapidly than export prices helped mask this improvement,
Commerce Department analysts said.
   The new figures confirmed an end-of-year narrowing of the trade
shortfall that already had shown up in the department's monthly
merchandise trade reports. The earlier figures showed a $43 billion
deficit for the fourth quarter and a $171.2 shortfall for all of
1987.
   Wednesday's figures were smaller because they subtracted factors
such as the cost of shipping, insurance and military sales from the
monthly numbers. The balance-of-payments deficit is also adjusted
for seasonal variations; the monthly figures are not.
   The October-December deficit was down from the $40.4 billion
deficit sustained in the third quarter. That figure was revised
upward from the $38.9 billion originally reported.
   Exports, buoyed by a weakening exchange value of the dollar,
increased $3.9 billion, or 6 percent, to a record $69.1 billion.
   Imports also rose to a record $109.2 billion in the fourth
quarter, but the increase of 4 percent or $3.8 billion was smaller
than that for exports.
   The report was cited by analysts as further evidence that
exchange-rate changes since 1985 finally are helping to trim the
trade deficit.
   The dollar is worth just 50 percent of its mid-l985 value
against Japanese and key European currencies, a devaluation that is
making imports more expensive to U.S. consumers while making
American goods cheaper and more competitive abroad.
   ``The trend has changed. Exports will continue to grow and I
think you will see a major decline in imports in the first, second
and third quarters of this year. The biggest surprise of 1988 will
be the narrowing of the trade deficit,'' said Jay Goldinger, chief
economist for Capital Insight, a Los Angeles bond brokerage.
   During the fourth quarter, the trade deficit with Japan
increased $1.3 billion to $15 billion; the deficit with Western
Europe was up $1.5 billion to $8.2 billion, and the shortfall with
Canada rose $100 million to $1.8 billion.
   In the same period, the deficit with the newly industrialized
countries in the Far East _ Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and
Singapore _ fell $2 billion to $8.1 billion.
   Non-petroleum imports increased $5.3 billion, or 6 percent, to
$98.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Passenger cars from Canada
were up 52 percent, a $1 billion increase. Auto imports from all
other countries, including Japan, fell by 7 percent, or $700
million.
   Petroleum imports decreased $1.5 billion, or 12 percent, to
$11.1 billion. Both prices and volume were down.
   On exports, non-agricultural shipments of U.S. products
increased $4.5 billion, or 8 percent, to $61.3 billion. Among the
largest increases were machinery, up $2.1 billion or 12 percent,
and automotive products to Canada, up $1 billion or 21 percent.
   However, agricultural exports fell during the quarter by $600
million, or 7 percent, to $7.7 billion.
   If ``constant'' dollars were used, subtracting the effects of
inflation since 1982, the trade deficit would show a $1.2 billion
decline in the fourth quarter, to $41.4 billion. For the year, the
deficit would have shown a decline to $168.6 billon, from a
hypothetical $177.4 billion constant-dollar deficit in 1986.
   The Commerce Department will use the figures to calculate an
even broader measure of trade, the current account deficit, which
measures not only trade between countries in merchandise, but also
in services, primarily investment earnings and transfer payments
such as foreign aid.

<HEAD>State DMV Revokes Driver's License In Howard Beach Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Department of Motor Vehicles today
revoked the driver's license of a man who was driving the car that
killed a black man in the Howard Beach racial assault case.
   DMV officials said the order against Dominic Blum's license
would take effect March 10. Blum would be eligible to apply to have
the license reinstated after 30 days, said DMV spokesman R. Bryan
Jackson.
   Blum's lawyer, William Breuer, said the order would be appealed
to the DMV's administrative review board and then to the courts, if
necessary.
   ``This is an aberration,'' Breuer said of the DMV's action.
``There's no evidence to support this.''
   Three white men were convicted of manslaughter in connection
with Michael Griffith being chased onto the Belt Parkway in Queens
where he was struck on the night of Dec. 20, 1986, by Blum's car.
   Blum, a court officer and son of a New York City policeman, was
not charged in connection with the case.
   In revoking Blum's license, DMV officials said Blum was guilty
of leaving the scene of a personal injury accident, operating a
motor vehicle at a speed greater than is reasonable and prudent,
and following too closely.

   Seven of eight accused members of the Westies
gang were found guilty today of various crimes including murder
conspiracy, extortion and drug dealing.
   The federal jury that convicted them will receive further
instructions and resume deliberations on the most significant
charges, racketeering and racketeering conspiracy.
   In its eighth day of deliberations, the sequestered jury in
Manhattan's federal court returned a finding that the Westies gang
was a racketeering enterprise and that seven of the eight
defendants were involved with the gang.
   The jury of 10 women and two men also found that all but one of
the defendants had each committed at least two of the 28 criminal
acts listed in the racketeering charges, including murders,
kidnappings, extortion, loansharking and drug dealing.
   But unlike other racketeering trials, U.S. District Judge
Whitman Knapp will give jurors additional instructions before
sending them back to determine if those acts were committed as part
of a racketeering enterprise.
   One defendant, John Halo, was acquitted on all charges.
   Convicted on various other charges were: reputed Westies leader
James Coonan; his wife, Edna; James ``Jimmy Mack'' McElroy; Richard
``Muggsy'' Ritter; William ``Indian'' Bokun; Thomas Collins; and
Collins' wife Florence.

<HEAD>EPA Criminal Unit Gets Reports of Chemical Dumping in Wake of Ohio
Oil Spill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reports that toxic chemicals may have been
dumped into the Ohio River while the water was fouled with diesel
fuel have been turned over to Environmental Protection Agency
criminal investigators, an EPA official said Wednesday.
   Robert Boodey, head of the EPA Region III criminal unit in
Philadelphia, declined, however, to say whether his office has
opened a formal investigation. He said agency policy forbids
commenting on criminal investigations.
   ``All I can tell you is we passed the information along,'' said
Thomas Voltaggio, Superfund chief for Region III. ``Once we send
the reports over to them we are really out of it. We want to
separate any criminal activity from regulatory activity.''
   EPA officials received the toxic dumping reports in mid-January,
several weeks after the Jan. 2 collapse of an Ashland Oil Inc. tank
near Pittsburgh fouled the Monongahela and Ohio rivers with an
estimated 730,000 gallons of diesel fuel.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., on Tuesday asked EPA to investigate
the reports.
   Traces of chloroform and methylene chloride, which both cause
cancer, and another industrial solvent, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, were
found in water samples by the West Virginia Department of Natural
Resources, according to officials in that department.
   They found no hard evidence, however, that the toxins were
deliberately dumped to take advantage of the Ashland pollution
crisis, said Ron Sandy, branch head of field opertions for the
natural resources department.
   The Pittsburgh Press reported Sunday that the toxic chemicals
were found in a 15-mile stretch of the river between Wheeling and
Moundsville.
   The concentrations exceeded the levels set by EPA as cancer
risks, but probably had no effect on public health, said Peter
Tennant, water quality program manager for the Ohio River Valley
Sanitation Commission.
   ``The intakes of all the water companies were shut down as the
spill passed,'' Tennant said. ``Also, those compounds ... are
easily removed by the carbon filtration systems water companies
use.''
   The tank collapse cut tap water service to about 23,000 suburban
Pittsburgh residents and threatened to do the same for an estimated
1 million others. Water companies along the Ohio, which is formed
by the Monongahela and Allegheny in Pittsburgh, closed their
intakes and relied on reserves and emergency supplies until the
diesel fuel passed.
   The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency has helped process
70 claims against Ashland from municipal governments seeking a
total of about $1 million, Karen Critchfield, PEMA disaster
assistance officer, said Tuesday at a meeting of federal, state and
local officials involved in the spill.

Everest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The son of one of first two men to conquer Mount
Everest has set his own sights on the mighty mountain, joining a
team that hopes to scale the world's highest peak to mark the 35th
anniversary of the feat.
   Tenzing Norbu, a Connecticut travel agent and the son of Tenzing
Norgay, said he joined the expedition to honor his late father, the
Sherpa guide who joined New Zealander Edmund Hillary at the top of
the world in 1953.
   ``For me, it is a pilgrimage to a mountain which has reshaped
the lives of my family and my people,'' Tenzing, 25, said at a news
conference Wednesday.``It will allow me to pay homage to my late
father.''
   The young Tenzing, a University of New Hampshire graduate who
works for a travel agency in Westport, Conn., only will go as far
as the base camp, about 17,000 feet, on the Chinese Tibetan side of
the mountain that straddles the Nepal-China border.
   The final assault on the summit of the 29,028-feet peak, the
world's highest, will be made by an international team of
mountaineers led by Robert Anderson, 30, a Denver native now living
in Auckland, New Zealand.
   Anderson, joined by two other Americans and a British climber,
will attempt to reach the peak without oxygen by an untried route
along the eastern side of the mountain.
   Like the Nepalese Tenzing and Hillary in 1953, the ``Everest
'88'' expedition will be supported by the United Nations. Miklos
Pinther, chief cartographer of the U.N. Secretariat, will travel to
the base camp and the climbers will have a U.N. flag to plant on
the summit.
   The group leaves Beijing on Thursday for Lhasa, the capital of
Tibet. From there, they will begin a five-day journey accompanied
by 45 yaks to a site where they will set up their base camp.
   Anderson, who came within 800 feet of the summit in a 1985
expedition to Everest, said the team hopes to put a man at the peak
by the end of April.
   He said the climbers will forgo oxygen to relive some of the
challenge of the original assault, much of which has been
diminished by technological advances in climbing equipment. Tenzing
and Hillary used oxygen in their climb.
   The young Tenzing said he will give the summit assault team
objects similar to those his father took up the mountain, including
a wooden black cat, a broken pencil and candy to pay respect to the
mountain gods.
   Tenzing and Hillary reached the summit on May 29, 1953. Since
then, 209 people have conquered the mountain, but only about 15
without oxygen, according to Anderson.
   Tenzing Norgay, the ``tiger of the snows,'' died in May 1986 at
the age of 72 in Darjeeling, India, where he set up a climbing
school. Hillary, now Sir Edmund, is New Zealand's ambassador to
India. The two men kept their vow never to reveal which first set
foot on the majestic pinnacle.

   General Motors Corp. said today it has boosted
its production plans for 1988 by 175,000 cars and trucks, will
recall 8,600 laid-off workers and reopen a temporarily closed
assembly plant.
   ``The strengthening demand for GM vehicles reflects the ongoing
product quality improvements resulting from plant modernization and
employee involvement programs,'' GM President Robert Stempel said
in a statement.
   ``This combined with very competitive retail incentive programs
has increased the value of GM products,'' he said.
   GM will increase production by running some plants, particularly
for trucks, on overtime; restoring second shifts at two U.S. plants
and one in Canada; and reopening its closed Framingham, Mass.,
assembly plant.
   At the three plants where GM had dropped the second shift,
workers from both shifts were sharing jobs by alternating between
two weeks on layoff and two weeks on the job, GM said.
   The Framingham assembly plant, which GM closed abruptly Nov. 30,
will reopen May 9 on one shift with 2,000 of its 3,700 workers. The
plant will build the Oldsmobile Cutlass Cierra, but will not resume
production of the Chevrolet Celebrity, GM spokeswoman Kathy Tanner
said.
   The second shift at GM's 4,200-worker Van Nuys, Calif., assembly
plant will be restored March 14, bringing 1,900 employees back full
time. The plant, which GM's only Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac
Firebird source, dropped the second shift last week.
   GM also will restore the second shift at its Oshawa No. 1 plant
in Oshawa, Ontario, bringing back 2,700 laid-off workers on March
21. The plant builds the Oldsmobile Cierra and Pontiac 6000.

   Gov. Evan Mecham's new attorney says he
will seek a postponement of the impeachment trial before the
Arizona Senate, which is set to start Monday.
   ``We will be requesting ... that the trial be postponed,''
Jerris Leonard said in an interview late Tuesday night. He said he
would meet today with state Supreme Court Chief Justice Frank
Gordon, who is presiding over the trial, and with Senate President
Carl Kunasek.
   Senate Majority Leader Bob Usdane, a Republican, noted today
that the trial already has been delayed a week and added, ``My
inclination is to not give them another minute of delay. ... I
think it's a tactic. I think they've known all along what they were
going to be doing.''
   Meanwhile, the state House's impeachment prosecutors today asked
that contempt sanctions be imposed against Mecham attorney Murray
Miller for refusing to provide a list of planned witnesses before
the Senate trial begins. Prosecutors William French and Paul
Eckstein accused Miller of ``patent, blatant disregard and
disobedience'' of a deadline set by Gordon.
   Leonard, who headed the Law Enforcement Assistance
Administration in the Nixon administration, also said he planned to
meet with Miller.
   Leonard said he was retained by Mecham Monday night.
   ``I am certainly very enthusiastic to take the case,'' Leonard
said.
   ``We're going to put together a very strong defense in his
behalf, a very forceful, fruitful, responsible defense and hope
that the members will be persuaded by it,'' Leonard said.
   Roy Dunton, former Mohave County Republican Party chairman and
founder of the Mecham Legal Defense Fund, said Tuesday that Leonard
was hired as the lead defense counsel.
   Edith Richardson, chief spokeswoman for Mecham's recall election
campaign, said Tuesday night that Leonard had been added to the
defense team, ``but I'm not sure of the terminology, whether he is
the lead attorney.''
   She said she believed that Miller and Michael Scott, the
attorney for Mecham's brother, Willard, would handle the criminal
defense.
   In addition to the impeachment trial, Mecham and his brother
face felony charges stemming from Mecham's alleged failure to
properly report a $350,000 campaign loan.
   Leonard ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate from Wisconsin in
1968 and in 1969 was named director of the Law Enforcement
Assistance Administration by President Nixon. He also served as an
assistant U.S. attorney general in Washington.
   He joined the Washington law firm of Manatt, Phelps, Rothenberg,
Tunney & Evan in May 1986.
   French and Eckstein, in their motion for contempt sanctions,
said Mecham's defense should not be permitted to call any witnesses
during the trial unless they meet today's 5 p.m. deadline to
provide a list.
   The prosecution submitted a list of 41 possible witnesses Monday.
   Miller said in a letter Monday he did not want to disclose his
planned witnesses because he thought it was unfair to hold Mecham's
impeachment trial before his criminal trial is over.
   Gordon also had set a 9 a.m. deadline today for Miller to file
any objections to the impeachment counts, but no documents were
filed by that time.
   Usdane said he thought the deadlines set by Gordon appeared to
be more of a request than an order, and questioned whether
sanctions could be imposed if there was no direct order involved.

   Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who is said
to have confessed an obsession with pornography, once wrote a
newspaper column saying pornography is as addictive as drugs.
   Swaggart faces disciplinary action by his denomination, the
Assemblies of God, for sexual misconduct. He was reportedly
observed and photographed while visiting a prostitute in New
Orleans.
   The Rev. Glen Cole of Sacramento, Calif., one of 13 members of
the Assemblies of God's ruling executive presbytery, said Swaggart
had confessed last week to having an obsession with pornography
dating back to his youth.
   James Hammill of Memphis, Tenn., a member of the denomination's
general counsel, said Monday night that the panel had been given
pictures of Swaggart going in and out of a New Orleans motel room
with a woman.
   In a July 1986 column for the Baton Rouge Sunday Advocate,
Swaggart wrote:
   ``Pornography is now considered as addictive as drugs, leading,
as with any addiction, to a need for escalated `doses' and
intensity. That, in turn, breeds desensitization, which leads to
the acting out of roles that have been at the heart of the nation's
most sensational serial murder and serial rape cases.
   ``Women and children, portrayed as nothing more than debased
objects on screen and in print, pay a particularly high price when
fantasy turns into reality.''
   Swaggart called those who make their living from pornography
``wretched, disgusting and dangerous.''
   In another column, Swaggart wrote: ``Most of today's sex, I'm
afraid, is a consequence of lust, and that has absolutely nothing
to do with love.
   ``You see, the laws of God cannot be abrogated with impunity.
Yes, we can do it, we are free moral agents. To do so, however,
means that we `pay the piper,' and we're now starting to do so.''
   The December issue of Swaggart's magazine, the Evangelist, was
critical of Mercer University, a Baptist school that did not take
disciplinary action against six women who posed for Playboy
magazine.
   ``It seems to us that if the standards set forth in the Word of
God were truly being taught, neither the girls nor the university
would find themselves in this embarrassing circumstance,'' the
magazine said.

   Portuguese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva,
disappointed in American aid levels, said today his nation wants to
review a 1983 U.S.-Portugal defense agreement giving the United
States access to a key air base.
   Cavaco Silva, emerging from a two-hour meeting at the White
House with President Reagan, said he told the president that cuts
in American aid have posed difficulties ``particularly at a time
when we are committed to the re-equipment of our armed forces and
trying to modernize the country.''
   ``I stated to President Reagan that the Portuguese government
intended to request that consultations be held under the terms of
the agreement,'' Cavaco Silva said.
   Reagan reiterated U.S. desire to help Portugal, but he said
``the efforts remain firm, even within the context of the harsh
budger realities that we all face. The task of leadership is to
rise to the challenge.''
   The Portuguese leader is using his first official visit to
Washington to register disappointment that the United States is
providing barely more than half the $205 million that Portugal
wants in aid each year for U.S. rights at Lajes Air Base in the
Azores, a vital refueling point in the Atlantic.
   The U.S. deficit-reduction program is responsible for the cuts,
not just in aid to Portugal but to the Philippines, Greece, and
Turkey _ other base-rights countries with struggling economies.
   A senior U.S. official, briefing reporters in advance of Cavaco
Silva's meeting at the White House with President Reagan today,
said ``we're going to have a foreign policy job to do in convincing
them why we're doing it and why we have to share the pain
together.''
   Cavaco Silva arrived on Tuesday for three days of talks.
   Portugal is disappointed in the aid levels, which have dipped to
$117 million this year after hitting a high of $205 million in
1984, one year after the current base agreement was signed.
   In his budget proposal last week, Reagan asked Congress for $163
million for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   The U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he
doubted the prime minister wanted a ``confrontation'' during his
visit to Washington.
   ``Rather, we'll look for ways we can figure out _ at least in
the short run _ some of our problems,'' the official said.
   Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci appeared
to have soothed Portuguese feelings enough to head off a request
for a formal review of the U.S.-Portugal defense agreement. He
received permission from Cavaco Silva's government to send over
surplus U.S. military equipment to make up part of the shortfall in
financial assistance.
   Experts from both defense departments are to meet soon to figure
out what Portugal can use from U.S. stocks.
   In the past two weeks, however, Portuguese Foreign Minister Joao
de Deus Pinheiro and President Mario Soares have expressed
reservations about the plan.
   Nevertheless, the U.S. official said, ``I think what he (Cavaco
Silva) told Frank Carlucci at the beginning of February, we expect,
holds.
   ``Obviously the Portuguese are disappointed with the levels of
assistance. So are we,'' the official said. ``Invariably we've
requested more money out of Congress and in recent years have not
done very well. As the budget crunch is being faced by all
agencies, obviously security assistance is one of those areas hit.
   ``We're probably going to face it in a great amount of
countries, particularly countries that feel they have a commitment
for a certain level of military assistance and believe that they
have been good allies.''

   Michael S. Dukakis said Wednesday he will do
whatever he has to do to counter any negative ads by his rivals for
the Democratic presidential nomination but hopes ``we can get this
campaign back on the high road.''
   The Massachusetts governor's second-place showing in the South
Dakota primary Tuesday was blamed in part on ``attack ads'' by top
vote-getter Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, Dukakis' South Dakota
chairman Fritz Wiecking was quoted as saying.
   The ads claimed Dukakis has no farm or trade policy and is the
biggest taxer in Massachusetts history. Dukakis called the ads
inaccurate.
   At a news conference, Dukakis said ``maybe it is a vain hope''
for the Democrats to avoid the kind of charges and countercharges
circulating among the Republican candidates, which Dukakis termed
damaging to the GOP, their candidates and the election process.
   ``I would prefer that the Democrats not copy the Republicans,
and that we try to run strong, positive campaigns in which if we
disagree with each other we do so agreeably and accurately,''
Dukakis said.
   But he added, ``negative campaigning and negative advertising
apparently is the thing all of the sudden. I have had to go through
that before, and if I have to do what I have to do, I will do so.
But I would hope that we can get this campaign back on the high
road.''
   Asked to elaborate, Dukakis said, ``I'll deal with that when the
time comes. I've had to do it before, I hope I don't have to do it
(again).''
   But he did specifically mention Gephardt and Tennessee Sen.
Albert Gore.
   Dukakis said the American people ``are not interested with what
Mr. Gore thinks of Mr. Gephardt, Mr. Gephardt thinks of Mr. Gore,
what both of them think of me.
   ``These two guys are at it every day. Now they are trying to get
me into it,'' Dukakis said.
   ``There is nothing wrong with disagreeing on particular
issues,'' he said. ``I have no problem with that. But I would hope
we could avoid it (negative campaigning). Can we? We'll see.''
   Saying he was the only Democratic candidate competing with equal
force in all states, Dukakis summed up Tuesday's results, including
his victory in Minnesota, by saying, ``We competed aggressively in
Minnesota, competed aggressively in South Dakota. And the results,
I think, are very heartwarming.''
   But as the candidates head toward Super Tuesday March 8, with
1,307 delegates up for grabs in 20 states and American Samoa,
Dukakis said, ``I don't think any of us is in a strong position. I
think it's wide open.
   ``Super Tuesday is two weeks ahead, and if there is one thing
that we are learning as a result of this (process) is that nobody
knows what's going to happen next,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   CIA Director William Webster said Wednesday
that President Reagan isn't buying the House and Senate
intelligence committees' proposals for preventing another
Iran-Contra affair, including a required 48-hour notice to Congress
of any covert action.
   Webster said the proposals would tie a president's hands in
cases where a premature leak could cost lives, and when a foreign
intelligence service with vital information insists that Congress
not be told.
   A 48-hour notification requirement would ``promote tension''
between Congress and a president ``for years to come,'' Webster
added.
   The CIA director told a House Intelligence subcommittee that a
recent presidential directive would make certain all but the most
extraordinary covert activities would be promptly reported to
Congress.
   And in any rare case where the president ordered a delayed
notification, a top-level policy group would review the decision
every 10 days, Webster said.
   Some lawmakers have suggested that they might have persuaded
Reagan not to sell arms to Iran had he notified the intelligence
committees or congressional leadership of his plans.
   Reagan's approval was withheld from Congress for 10 months in
1986, until U.S. negotiations with Iran were disclosed by a
Lebanese publication.
   The administration has already lost round one in its battle to
maintain greater discretion on when to notify Congress. The Senate
Intelligence Committee voted 13-2 for legislation that includes the
48-hour requirement. It is similar in other respects to the House
bill Webster is now trying to derail.
   ``A bill which fails to preserve the flexibility and authority
the president needs to conduct intelligence activities effectively
will not be acceptable to the president,'' Webster said. He did not
say specifically whether Reagan would veto such a measure.
   Current law requires an administration to give the intelligence
committees or eight top congressional leaders prior notification of
significant intelligence activities. But it allows the president to
delay in extraordinary circumstances, and issue the notification in
``timely fashion.''
   In fact, Webster said, there have been only three instances when
timely notification was not given: the Iran-Contra affair, the
rescue of Americans from Iran who were hidden by Canadian diplomats
and the failed military attempt to rescue American hostages in Iran.
   Webster said the Iran-Contra affair, in which profits from the
arms sales to Iran were diverted to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua,
was caused by ``officials failing to follow existing procedures and
rules.''
   ``Some allowance must be made for that rare case where a limited
delay in congressional notification is critical to preserve the
absolute security of an operation when, for example, lives are at
stake,'' he contended.
   But former Defense Secretary Clark Clifford testified that the
legislation does not go far enough.
   He suggested that Congress stop financing any covert activity
for which notification was not given. And he proposed that any
government employee who willingly violated the prohibition of funds
be subject to criminal activity.
   ``We are better off without covert activities entirely than with
them out of control,'' said Clifford, who served in the Johnson
administration.

   The Supreme Court today overturned a $200,000
award won by evangelist Jerry Falwell against Hustler magazine and
its publisher Larry Flynt, extending the legal protections for
parody and satire, even when they are pornographic.
   The court unanimously ruled that even pornographic spoofs about
a public figure enjoy the free-speech protections of the
Constitution's First Amendment if those spoofs could not reasonably
have been interpreted as stating actual facts about the person.
   The justices stripped Falwell of the award he had won for
``emotional distress'' caused by an advertising parody in Hustler.
   ``Outrageousness in the area of political and social discourse
has an inherent subjectiveness about it which would allow a jury to
impose liability on the basis of the jurors' tastes or views, or
perhaps on the basis of their dislike of a particular expression,''
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court.
   ``An `outrageous' standard thus runs afoul of our longstanding
refusal to allow damages to be awarded because the speech in
question may have an adverse emotional impact on the audience,'' he
said.
   Falwell's lawsuit arose out of a full-page ``ad parody'' that
appeared in the November 1983 and March 1984 issues of Hustler, a
sexually explicit magazine.
   Featuring a photograph of Falwell, the ad purportedly quotes him
discussing a sexual encounter with his mother and describing
himself as a habitual drunkard.
   At the bottom of the page in small print readers are told that
the ad is a parody ``not to be taken seriously.''
   Falwell charged Hustler and Flynt with libel, invasion of
privacy and intentional infliction of emotional distress. He asked
for $45 million in damages.
   A federal jury in Roanoke, Va., in late 1984 ruled that the ad
did not libel Falwell, and the presiding judge threw out the
invasion-of-privacy allegation.
   But the jury ruled for Falwell on his emotional-distress
allegation, and awarded him $200,000. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals upheld the award, but today's decision threw it out.
   Falwell, a Baptist minister and founder of an organization known
as the Moral Majority, said he had sued Flynt and his magazine to
protect his late mother's reputation. ``I can't imagine any
red-blooded male in the world not being incensed,'' he told
reporters when attending Supreme Court arguments in the case last
December.
   ``I fully appreciate the deep concerns the court has shown for
the sacredness of the First Amendement,'' Falwell said in a
statement today. ``However, I respectfully disagree with their
ruling. Just as no person may scream ``Fire!'' in a crowded theater
when there is no fire, and find cover under the First Amendment,
likewise, no sleaze-merchant like Larry Flynt should be able to use
the First Amendment as an excuse for maliciously and dishonestly
attacking public figures as he has so often done.
   ``I believe the Supreme Court has given the green light to Larry
Flynt and his ilk to print what they wish about any public figure
at any time with no fear of reprisal.''
   Flynt, who also attended the December argument session, had
voiced concern about his fate before the high court but added, ``My
indictment is mainly for bad taste.''
   He said today, ``I'm excited, absolutely delighted. Even though
the suit had no merit in the beginning, I still spent over $1
million in attorney's fees. There is no way to get those back. It's
what you call paying to defend the First Amendment.''
   Flynt added: ``With this record on the book, I have protected
... other newspapers and magazines. I'm not talking about
pornography. We are blazing a trail for a lot of people, like
political cartoonists.''
   In today's decision, the court noted that ``graphic depictions
and satirical cartoons have played a prominent role in public and
political debate.''
   It discounted Falwell's contention that the Hustler parody was
so outrageous that it should be distinguished from more traditional
political cartoons.
   ``There is no doubt that the caricature of (Falwell) published
in Hustler is at best a distant cousin of the (traditional)
political cartoons, and a rather poor relation at that,'' Rehnquist
said. But he added that there is no way the law can punish one and
let the other flourish.
   The court's vote was 8-0. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined
the court last Thursday, did not participate in the decision.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Expanded the power of communities to impose rent controls,
ruling that hardships to tenants may be considered when landlords
seek rent increases.
   By a 6-2 vote, the justices upheld a San Jose, Calif., ordinance
that has been attacked as a ``Robin Hood'' law that steals from the
rich to pay the poor.
   _ Broadened protection for criminal defendants who claim they
were enticed by law enforcement officials into committing a crime.
   By a 6-2 vote, the justices overturned a bribery conviction
against Frederick Mathews of Milwaukee, Wis., a former Small
Business Administration official.
   _ Made it a bit easier for prosecutors to talk to criminal trial
juries about a defendant's failure to testify.
   In splintered voting, the court reinstated the mail fraud
conviction of a man who prosecutors say set his tennessee home
afire so he could file a false insurance claim.
   _ Bolstered the right default-judgment losers have to challenge
a judgment entered after they fail to respond to a lawsuit.
   The justices unanimously ruled for a Houston businessman in his
challenge of a default judgment awarded against him six years ago
for a $5,000 debt owed to a medical center.
   _ Ruled that federal judges lack authority to order the
government to pay fees to lawyers who successfully obtain overdue
federal welfare for poor people who are aged, blin or disabled.
   The 8-0 ruling in a case from Arkansas held that federal
officials are not required by law to withhold a portion of a
recipient's benefits to pay the attorney.
   The Hustler case was Hustler vs. Falwell, 86-1278.

   A Reagan administration proposal to reduce the
questions asked in the 1990 Census drew fire Wednesday from city
officials and statisticians who said vital information would be
lost.
   The White House Office of Management and Budget has required
that several questions be dropped, or asked of fewer people, in
this spring's Census dress rehearsal.
   No final decision has been made on whether the changes will be
extended to the 1990 census, according to Joseph R. Wright Jr. of
OMB, who contended the cuts were made to reduce the paperwork
burden on the public.
   But the dress rehearsal head counts in the states of Washington
and Missouri are scheduled for March 20. On April 1, the formal
questions planned for the 1990 census must be sent to Congress.
   The proposed changes would introduce ``crippling sampling
errors'' into the Census, charged Arthur Young, retired chief of
the Census Bureau's housing division.
   Young spoke at a joint hearing of the House Select Committee on
Aging and the subcommittee on Housing and Consumer Interests.
   ``It will look like a full census, but it will be nothing but a
hollow shell,'' Young said. Eliminating questions or cutting by
half the number of people answering some of them would all but
eliminate much data on city block areas, he said.
   ``The OMB cuts will leave the nation after the 1990 census with
a housing data base inadequate for decision making at the local
level,'' he said. And this loss of information would occur at a
time when more and more programs are being switched from federal to
state and local operation.
   Art Holland, mayor of Trenton, N.J., added the warning that the
cuts ``could have potentially debilitating impacts upon the cities
of this nation to adequately plan for the future and to allocate
scarce resources for the betterment of their residents and
businesses.'
   You don't have to be a statistician to know that reducing the
number of people asked a particular question reduces the quality of
the data collected, Holland went on.
   Cities use census information to target community development
block grant funds and economic development money, to prepare
housing master plans, to target neighborhood eligibility for
federal, state and local assistance and to pinpoint areas in need
of programs, he said.
   The cities depend on the census every 10 years as their primary
source of information, and all other collections of information use
the census as a base, or are mere estimates, he added.
   The OMB proposal would drop questions on the cost of utilities,
type of heating equipment and fuel used to heat water. In addition
seven questions would be moved from the short form answered by
everyone to the longer form sent only to a sample of households.
Those include information on number of rooms in a house, plumbing,
rent and value, presence of a telephone and whether the residence
is a condominium.

   The driver of the car that struck and killed
Michael Griffith, the black victim in the Howard Beach racial
assault case, had his driver's license revoked Wednesday by the
state Department of Motor Vehicles.
   DMV officials said Dominic Blum's license was suspended
effective March 10. Blum would be eligible to apply to have the
license reinstated after 30 days, said DMV spokesman R. Bryan
Jackson.
   Blum's lawyer, William Breuer, said the order would be appealed.
   Griffith was struck by Blum's car on Dec. 20, 1986, as Griffith
was chased onto a highway by a mob of white youths. Three
teen-agers have been convicted of manslaughter in the case, and
seven other defendants face trial on lesser charges.
   Blum, 26, a court officer in New York City Family Court, left
the scene of the accident and didn't come forward for several hours.
   DMV officials said Blum was guilty of leaving the scene of a
personal injury accident, going 55 miles per hour in a 50 mph zone
and following too closely.
   Breuer said he filed a $20 million libel and slander suit last
week against lawyers C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox Jr., who had
alleged that Blum had intentionally hit Griffith.

   Taxpayers are apt to get the wrong answer to
one of every four tax questions they telephone to the Internal
Revenue Service, the agency acknowledged Tuesday. Even correct
replies may not be complete.
   ``We are obviously not satisfied with answering only three out
of four questions correctly,'' IRS Commissioner Lawrence B. Gibbs
said in reporting the results of a test of his employees. He
questioned the validity of a separate survey by the General
Accounting Office, which found even less chance of a correct answer.
   GAO, an arm of Congress, made 224 calls to IRS telephone
``assistors'' and got the correct answer to only 61 percent of the
technical tax questions asked; 57 percent of the answers were
complete and 4 percent were accurate but incomplete.
   Jennie S. Stathis, an associate director of GAO, acknowledged
that because of the limited number of calls and because they were
not statistically weighted, the results ``are very preliminary and
not projectable at this time.''
   The IRS expects 22 million telephone calls for tax answers this
filing season.
   The IRS' own survey is based on 5,000 calls to some of the 4,500
agency employees whose job is to answer taxpayers' questions about
how to fill out their tax returns. Sixty-one percent of the
questions were answered completely and correctly and another 13
percent were answered correctly but not completely.
   At this time a year ago, before most provisions of the massive
1986 tax overhaul took effect, GAO said the IRS was giving the
correct answers to questions 79 percent of the time.
   ``I am comfortable that we are answering three out of four
questions correctly,'' Gibbs said.
   But Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and
Means oversight subcommittee, said, ``With one-fourth being given
the wrong information, I don't know that that is a complimentary
figure.''
   No matter the source of advice on filling out a tax return, the
taxpayer has the responsibilty to see that the return is correct.
Even if the IRS makes a mistake in its advice, a taxpayer can be
subject to a penalty and interest for underpaying. The agency
traditionally has waived penalties if a taxpayer can prove a
mistake resulted from bad IRS advice, but there is a question
whether the law permits interest on an underpayment to be waived.
   Because of the new law, Gibbs said, he is not surprised that the
IRS assistors are giving more wrong answers than they did a year
ago. He noted Money magazine had asked 50 tax professionals outside
the government to calculate how much tax a hypothetical family owed
and had received 50 different answers.
   ``Very simply, taxpayers, practitioners and the IRS are having
trouble coping with the magnitude and the velocity of tax-law
changes,'' Gibbs said, noting that Congress has fallen into the
habit of passing a major tax bill almost every year.
   In the 1986 overhaul, said Rep. Richard Schulze, R-Pa.,
``Congress may have passed such sweeping tax changes'' that they
will prove impossible to implement.
   Most of the changes in that new law _ including lower rates,
fewer deductions and higher personal exemptions _ are being
reflected for the first time on the returns that are due by April
15.
   If another GAO survey is any indication, the 1986 law brought
anything but simplification. The agency asked 423 taxpayers outside
IRS offices in six cities how preparing this year's return compared
with last year. The results:
   _43 percent said it was harder or much harder this year.
   _32 percent found little difference.
   _13 percent said this year was easier or much easier.
   _10 percent were not sure.
   Overall, the GAO's Ms. Stathis said, ``IRS did a good job in
trying to prepare its employees and the taxpaying public for the
1988 filing season.''
   In addition to the problem with incorrect answers to telephoned
questions, she said some IRS offices have run out of certain tax
forms. Some tax professionals also have complained that the IRS has
provided insufficient guidance on some fine points of the new law,
she added.
   About 84 percent of taxpayers who went to IRS offices for advice
were satisfied with the result, and 74 percent received assistance
within 15 minutes, GAO found.

   Shock-rock star Alice Cooper, who says he
bought his first car years ago from impeached Arizona Gov. Evan
Mecham, has half-serious plans to run for political office in his
home state.
   ``I'm definitely a write-in candidate,'' said the Phoenix-born
singer. ``Hey, I'm a native. I'm a registered voter. I represent
the Wild Party and I even have a campaign slogan: `Alice Cooper _ A
troubled man for troubled times.'''
   Cooper, 39, is in Phoenix for a show Saturday night that will
end the American leg of his year-long comeback tour.
   Cooper, born Vincent Furnier, a minister's son, said he bought
his first automobile from Mecham, who owned and operated a Pontiac
dealership in nearby Glendale. Cooper went on to fame with his
outrageous makeup and performances, as well as such hits as
``School's Out.''
   The Republican governor, who took office in January 1987, was
recently indicted by a state grand jury for attempting to conceal a
$350,000 campaign loan. Mecham is facing both a criminal trial this
month and a May 17 recall election.

<HEAD>TV Evangelist Robert Schuller Says He Won't Be Caught in Sex
Scandal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GARDEN GROVE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evangelist Robert Schuller says he
has no need to worry about facing a damaging sex scandal like
fellow TV preachers Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart because he's
never been unfaithful to his wife.
   ``I can tell you right here and now, as far as Robert Schuller
is concerned, I have had sex with only one woman _ my wife _ and
the first time was my wedding night,'' the founder of Orange
County's Crystal Cathedral church said Tuesday.
   Bakker lost his TV ministry last year and was defrocked by the
Assemblies of God Church after he admitted to a sexual tryst with
former church secretary Jessica Hahn. The same congregation
suspended Swaggart after he admitted last week to having visited a
reputed prostitute in a motel.
   Schuller, 61, made his remarks to approximately 1,000 people
attending a special Tuesday night meeting where it was announced
that the Rev. Herman ``Bud'' Ridder, president of the Crystal
Cathedral since 1983, was resigning.
   Schuller founded the Crystal Cathedral, originally known as the
Garden Grove Community Church, in the mid-1950s. The church, known
for its stunning crystal cathedral headquarters in Garden Grove,
now boasts more than 5,500 members.

<HEAD>Watkins Urges $20 Billion, 10-Year Effort To Deal With IV Drug
Users</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a White House commission
recommended Wednesday that federal and local governments spend an
additional $20 billion over the next decade to fight AIDS among
drug abusers.
   Retired Navy Adm. James D. Watkins, head of the AIDS commission
appointed by President Reagan last summer, acknowledged that the
call for such massive spending on drug addicts might prove
controversial.
   But he said 200 hours of testimony from 350 witnesses has left
the panel convinced that the deadly disease is spreading most
rapidly among the nation's estimated 1.3 million intravenous drug
abusers and their sexual partners.
   Watkins noted that some health leaders are estimating 10,000 to
20,000 infants could be infected with the AIDS virus three years
from now as a result of sexual unions involving drug addicts who
can easily spread the disease among themselves by sharing
contaminated needles.
   Any realistic attempt to combat AIDS in general must focus on
drug abusers, he said.
   Health leaders have long feared that any significant outbreak of
AIDS into the general population most likely would start with the
sex partners of IV drug users, most of whom are concentrated in 24
major cities.
   The full 13-member AIDS commission is expected to adopt most or
all of Watkins' recommendations at a day-long business meeting next
Monday and then formally submit them to Reagan the following week
in what will be the panel's first substantive report.
   A final report is due at the White House June 24. Watkins
promised it will get into such controversial areas as widespread
AIDS testing, discrimination against people with AIDS and other
legal and social questions.
   He said the commission would be ``at loggerheads with
ourselves'' if it tried to agree on recommendations on those
matters at this point. The commission will turn specifically to
hearing testimony on those topics next month.
   Meanwhile, he said, the panel saw no reason to delay making
recommendations in areas where there was consensus. There could be
subsequent interim reports before the final one this summer,
Watkins said.
   Watkins' call for an additional $1 billion a year in federal
spending on drug abuse intervention programs alone would nearly
double the total $1.3 billion Public Health Service AIDS budget
Reagan has proposed for fiscal 1989.
   The retired chief of naval operations told reporters that state
and local governments will need to increase their own combined
spending on drug programs by a like amount and that both the
federal and local efforts will need to continue for 10 years.
   ``You cannot just throw in some money one year and drop it out
next year,'' said Watkins.
   He said only 15 percent of the nation's intravenous drug abusers
are in treatment plans and tht there are three- to six-month
waiting lists in most major cities for addicts seeking help in
getting off drugs.
   ``Anyone crying for help should get help on demand,'' Watkins
said.
   Another major theme among Watkins' 60 pages of recommendations
is additional financial support for the Food and Drug
Administration, which he characterized as ``a kind of orphan agency
standing on their own'' in the annual budget fights.
   ``We're picking up his advocacy,'' Watkins said of FDA
Commissioner Frank Young. The chairman said the panel had toured
FDA headquarters in surburban Maryland and concluded ``we look
something like a Third World agency out there.''
   He noted that the new Reagan budget proposes $25 million for an
FDA laboratory. ``We're saying he needs another building'' in
addition to the one proposed, said Watkins.
   Watkins expressed confidence that the full commission would
adopt most of his recommendations and declared, ``It is not in our
charter to worry about the political impact.''
   Asked his reaction to the possibility of presidential
candidates, particularly Democrats, using his recommendations to
``zing the White House'' for not doing more earlier, Watkins
replied:
   ``How do you avoid politicizing something in an election year?
If they all adopt this and say `Let's get on with it,' that's the
kind of politicization I like.''

<TEXT>
   Two teen-agers have been arrested after a
series of violent armed robberies and a slaying in which one of
them allegedly portrayed the sadistic character in ``Nightmare on
Elm Street.''
   In all the incidents, Angel Regino, 18, allegedly used a
sawed-off rifle, wore a blue bandana over his face, and donned a
fedora, a guise worn by the film's protagonist, Freddie, who had
knives attached to his fingers, said Police Lt. Mike Melton.
   Thursday night, a man was robbed, ordered to strip, and then
shot as he fled from a robber calling himself Freddie, Melton said
Tuesday.
   The victim told police the robber had said, ```You'll never meet
anyone like me again,''' the officer said.
   A sawed-off rifle, trenchcoat and blue bandana were discovered
at Regino's parents' home in the neighborhood where most of the
attacks occurred, Melton said.
   Regino is alleged to have been involved in at least eight armed
robberies and one killing since early January, several involving an
accomplice, Melton said.
   Regino was booked for investigation of murder Monday and was
being held withox a| the Harbor Divison station. The alleged
accomplice, a 16-year-old whose name was withheld because of his
age, was being held for questioning, said Sgt. Larry Kallestad.
   The two teen-agers are believed to be gang members, and Regino,
who was taken into custody at a drug treatment center, may have
been a PCP user, Kallestad said.
   The attacks blamed on the pair started Jan. 5 and ended Sunday
when $300 was taken from a Chinese restaurant.
   On Jan. 7, a 49-year-old man was killed after being robbed and
shot several times while he apparently slept in his truck. A
passerby who stopped to help was also assaulted, police said.

   Air Force combat training over
Everglades National Park would spoil the wilderness and threaten
endangered species, the state Cabinet concluded Tuesday.
   Voting unanimously, the Cabinet urged Air Force Secretary Edward
C. Aldridge not to pursue a proposal for low-level, high-speed jet
fighter missions over the national park.
   Park Superintendent Michael Finley agreed with the Cabinet and
said the park already is stressed by South Florida's expanding
population.
   ``To add one more type of stress to Everglades National Park
could be the nail in the coffin,'' said Finley. ``At some point ...
the Everglades will be to South Florida what Central Park is to New
York City.''
   Gov. Bob Martinez was on a trade mission in Europe and did not
participate in the Cabinet vote.
   Lt. Tom Barth, deputy for public affairs at Homestead Air Force
Base, said the training missions still were in the planning stage
and might not be carried out over the park. A second site is being
examined southwest of Lake Okeechobee, north of Alligator Alley.
   The training missions would not use live ammunition or bombs, he
said.
   Air Force officials say the South Florida missions would be
cheaper than continuing to send figters to other bases for combat

   A crisis over an unconstitutional state
budget blew over Wednesday almost as quickly as it developed after
West Virginia officials agreed to continue government as usual
until they hear more from the state Supreme Court.
   The high court issued a 3-2 opinion on Tuesday calling the
budget unconstitutional because it contains a $26 million deficit.
But the court granted a 60-day grace period during which the order
would be suspended while a rehearing is requested.
   Check-writing officials were thrown into a panic initially, with
Treasurer A. James Manchin saying he would not process any more
state bills. But Manchin reversed himself overnight and said
Wednesday he would process the checks as usual.
   He called the high court's ruling a ``whimper in the wind'' and
said it carried enough delays to put off any final action until the
new fiscal year that starts on July 1.
   Manchin released a number of checks for hospital workers on
Wednesday. Manchin's reversal also apparently clears the way for
the state payroll to be distributed on Monday as scheduled.
   Gov. Arch Moore already has scheduled a special session of the
Legislature for April 12 to look at education matters, and the
budget problem presumably could be considered at that time.
   The governor has a possible safety valve. On Tuesday, he
received a bill that would allow him to borrow up to $50 million
from the state's pension and workers' compensation trust fund, said
gubernatorial press secretary John Price.
   If he signs the bill, it might be possible to solve the crisis
by simply dumping $26 million into the current budget.
   Auditor Glen Gainer, who also signs the state's checks, said he
questions whether the loan is legal but said he would not contest
it in court.
   A lawsuit filed last fall by the West Virginia Education
Association challenging $13.5 million in cuts in education this
year sparked the high court decision.
   The unprecedented ruling comes as lawmakers grapple with bills
that Gainer estimates will be $170 million by the June 30 end of
the fiscal year. In addition, lawmakers are trying to write a
budget for the next fiscal year.
   Tax collections are $35.7 million behind predictions this year,
and a national investment firm issued a national bond rating
warning against West Virginia on Dec. 15 because of the financial
crisis facing the state.
   House Finance Chairman George Farley suggested his colleagues
simply ignore the high court decision and continue to work on the
budget for next year.

   Artist Clayton LeFevre has sulked
for a couple of years because Prince Charles refused to sign a
portrait, so he has taken his revenge with a window display
depicting the Queen of England and the Duchess of York as derelicts.
   LeFevre installed the display at his studio this week,
anticipating the arrival on Friday of the Duke and Duchess of York,
also known as Prince Andrew and the former Sarah Ferguson. The
couple is coming to participate in UK-LA, a celebration of British
art and culture.
   LeFevre started his ``100 Club'' celebrity collection in
Houston, where he lived until four months ago.
   He has completed 105 of the acrylic portraits, including Frank
Sinatra, Nancy Reagan, Eddie Murphy, Muhammad Ali and Dolly Parton.
   Working from photographs, he did two portraits of the prince. He
sent both to Charles, asking that one be signed and returned and
the other be kept as a gift.
   ``Prince Charles is the only one of the 105 who has refused,''
said LeFevre, who offered the portrats to Prince Charles and
Princess Diana when they visited Houston in 1986.
   ``They took the two paintings back to Buckingham Palace. They
told me if I wanted the (one) painting back, they would send it
unsigned, otherwise they would give it to charity.
   ``I was just happy to get my copy back,'' he said.
   Angus Mackay, public affairs officer for the British Consulate
in Los Angeles, said no insult was intended to LeFevre by the royal
family. They never sign autographs for anyone.
   ``I think it's unfortunate he interprets what is a general
ground rule as a specific slight to him apparently,'' Mackay said.

   A kindergarten teacher has inspired
legislation which would designate Mississippi mud cake as the
official state cake.
   Sen. Hainon Miller of Greenvill introduced the bill Monday at
the urging of Mary Jo Ayres of Leland, who wants to add the
chocolate dessert to the list of state-sanctioned M-words so she
can help her students pronounce the consonant.
   ``If you think about it, it never occurred to me before, but we
have `Mississippi' _ it starts with an `m.' Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm,''
Miller said.
   ``And the official state bird is the m-m-mocking bird,'' he
said, ``and the official flower is the m-m-m-magnolia.''
   And what would one eat with mud cake? The official state drink _
m-m-milk, of course.

   Ewing Oil is selling the Southern Cross Ranch,
where scenes for the television show ``Dallas'' have been shot.
   The seller is the real Ewing Oil of Dallas, not the nasty,
power-hungry outfit run by J.R. Ewing on the CBS nighttime serial.
   On the show, the Ewings' ranch is supposed to be in San Angelo
in West Texas. In real life, it's a breeding ranch in Forney, 20
miles east of Dallas.
   The 455-acre ranch features a two-story Spanish-style home atop
a hill, a swimming pool, a gazebo, a guest house, a foreman's
house, stables and stock tanks.
   Harry James, one of the principal owners of Ewing Oil, gave the
ranch to the company as equity, and it was recently appraised at
$61.5 million, the company said.
   Tim Bell, Ewing Oil's chief executive officer, said the ranch is
not generating revenue for the company. ``It has nothing to do with
the rise and fall of oil prices. We're just not in the ranching
business,'' Bell said.
   He said the ranch has not been used in the filming of ``Dallas''
for several years.
   Melvin Giller, president of Nationwide Auction Co., said he's
unsure what the ranch will bring on the auction block March 12, but
has received more than 500 calls since it was advertised.

   A $625,000 fund to assist U.S. artists appearing
in international festivals and exhibitions was announced Tuesday by
the National Endowment for the Arts, the U.S. Information Agency
and the Rockefeller Foundation.
   In 1988, $325,000 will be available from the fund for performing
artists and $300,000 for visual artists.
   Frank Hodsoll, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts,
said that private contributions could raise annual funding to $1
million.
   ``I think it is important this fund never become so big or so
powerful it's the only way American artists can be represented at
international festivals and exhibitions. That preserves a degree of
freedom for people who go to these things,'' Hodsoll said.

   Singer Mickey Gilley says he was shocked
by revelations of sexual misconduct by his cousin, the Rev. Jimmy
Swaggart.
   ``The family has always held Jimmy on a pedestal so high that
this is a total shock to us,'' Gilley said Tuesday in an interview

   ``We were saddened when he went on television and said he had a
personal problem and had made a mistake,'' Gilley said from
Houston. ``But I will have to say it takes a very strong man to say
what he did.''
   On Sunday, Swaggart confessed to an unspecified sin before 7,500
people at his family worship center in Baton Rouge, La.
   Gilley said he still has faith in the basic integrity of
   Swaggart, who has ``always been dedicated to the Lord,'' even
when he, Gilley and their rock 'n' roll entertainer cousin, Jerry

<TEXT>
   The city of Baytown, banking that City
Hall may be sitting on a pool of oil, is looking in its own back
yard for more income.
   The City Council has approved a plan for Trace Oil and Gas to
drill a shallow 5,000-6,000-foot well near the entrance to the
30-acre, wooded City Hall complex. The city would receive a 20
percent royalty on any petroleum uncovered under the agreement.
   ``We're keeping our fingers crossed,'' said Emmett Hutto, mayor
of this town of 57,000 people about 30 miles east of Houston. ``If
the well brings in $100,000 a year, we could knock a half-cent off
our tax rate.''
   Jim Bob Jackson, a geologist and co-owner of Trace Oil in
Houston, projects the company has a 50-50 chance of hitting oil.
   ``We feel confident. We drilled a well 500 feet south of there
on Maryland Avenue last year and got the smell of oil,'' he said.
   After careful calculations, his research indicated an oil pool
could be trapped beside a fault under the lush complex, he said.
   The company has permission to drill about 2,000 feet from the
city buildings. An 80-foot derrick will be erected and the drilling
will continue around the clock for five to six days, Jackson said.
If oil is discovered, a fence will be erected around the site and
landscaping will be used to disguise the oil pumping operations, he
said.
   ``We made stipulations in the lease so that it won't be a messy
operation,'' Hutto said.
   The company will spend about $150,000 on the prospecting venture.
   ``We expect it could bring in anywhere from $500 to $15,000 per
day in revenue, which is a minor find,'' Jackson said.
   The prospect of oil under the building is not outlandish, said
Assistant City Manager Bobby Rountree.
   ``After all, this is an oil town,'' agreed Jackson. ``Exxon, one
of the world's largest refineries, made Baytown what it is today.''

<HEAD>High Court Expands Parody Protections by Rejecting Award to
Falwell</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court expanded significantly the
legal protections for parody and satire Wednesday as it overturned
a $200,000 award evangelist Jerry Falwell had won against Hustler
magazine and publisher Larry Flynt.
   The justices ruled unanimously that ``emotional distress''
lawsuits filed by public figures targeted by such spoofs should be
as difficult to win as libel suits.
   And the court unanimously said that even pornographic spoofs
enjoy the free-speech protection of the Constitution's First
Amendment.
   The Hustler material was a phony ad purportedly quoting Falwell
discussing an incestual encounter with his mother in a Virginia
outhouse and his habit of getting drunk before giving sermons.
   Small print at the bottom of the page said the ad was ``not to
be taken seriously.''
   Led by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the court rejected
Falwell's arguments _ and a federal appeals court's ruling _ that
some parodies are so outrageous they do not deserve legal
protection.
   ``Outrageousness in the area of political and social discourse
has an inherent subjectiveness about it which would allow a jury to
impose liability on the basis of the jurors' tastes or views,''
Rehnquist said, adding that such results are constitutionally
impermissible.
   The decision was praised by news organizations.
   ``It's easy to stand up for nice talk from nice people but the
First Amendment protects all speech, even the outrageous,'' said
Paul McMasters of the Society for Professional Journalists.
   ``Editorial cartoons have been a particular target of lawsuits
lately,'' McMasters said. ``The court was right to speak up so
forcefully on behalf of ... tools editorial cartoonists wield so
well.''
   But Falwell, a Baptist minister and founder of an organization
called the Moral Majority, disagreed. ``No sleaze merchant like
Larry Flynt should be able to use the First Amendment as an excuse
for maliciously and dishonestly attacking public figures,'' he said
after learning of his defeat. ``I'm sure the justices were holding
their noses while making the ruling.''
   Flynt said he was ``absolutely delighted'' by the ruling.
   ``Even though the suit had no merit in the beginning, I still
spent over $1 million in attorney's fees. ... It's what you call
paying to defend the First Amendment,'' Flynt said by telephone
from Los Angeles.
   He said he was concerned about small newspapers and house organs
and others unable to afford to fight such a battle.
   ``They just go out of business,'' Flynt said.
   Rehnquist's opinion drew a distinction between the Hustler ad
and more traditional forms of parody such as editorial cartoons,
calling the Falwell spoof ``a distant cousin of the political
cartoon, and a rather poor relation at that.''
   Following publication of the parody in November 1983 and March
1984, Falwell sued Hustler, a sexually explicit magazine, and its
publisher for $45 million in damages for libel, invasion of privacy
and the intentional infliction of emotional distress. He won on the
emotional-distress allegations only and a federal jury in Roanoke,
Va., awarded him $200,000 in damages in late 1984. The 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the award.
   But the high court said the same tough standard of proof Falwell
faced in trying to prove he was libeled should have applied as well
to his emotional-distress allegations.
   The Supreme Court since 1964 has required that free-speech
considerations be taken into account in libel cases. But those
considerations never before have been required in
emotional-distress cases.
   In order to win a libel suit, a public figure must prove that
the allegedly libelous statement was false and was made with
``actual malice'' _ knowledge or reckless disregard of its falsity.
   Until Wednesday, winning an emotional-distress suit was easier
for public figures. They only had to prove that the defendant
intended to cause the distress, that the defendant's conduct was
extreme and that emotional distress actually was suffered.
   Now, if public figures sue over some spoof _ whether alleging
libel or emotional distress _ they must meet the actual-malice
standard of proof. And in proving falsity, they must show that the
spoof reasonably could have been interpreted as stating actual
facts.
   The court's vote was 8-0. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who joined
the court Thursday, did not participate in the decision.
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Expanded by a 6-2 vote the power of communities to impose rent
controls, ruling in a case from San Jose, Calif., that tenant
hardships may be considered when regulating the increases sought by
landlords.
   _Ruled unanimously in an Arkansas case that federal judges may
not order the government to pay fees to lawyers who successfully
obtain overdue federal welfare benefits for the aged, blind or
disabled.
   _Made it a bit easier for prosecutors to talk to criminal trial
juries about a defendant's failure to testify as it reinstated a
man's Tennessee mail fraud conviction.
   _Broadened protections for criminal defendants who claim they
were enticed by law enforcement officials into committing a crime
by overturning, 6-2, on entrapment grounds a Milwaukee man's
bribery conviction.

<TEXT>
   Democrat Paul Simon, admitting ``there is no
sense in my fooling myself,'' said Wednesday his battered
presidential campaign is skipping the Super Tuesday primaries and
caucuses to try to recover from four straight defeats.
   Republican also-ran Jack Kemp vowed he, too, would press on
despite an 0-5 record. Unlike Simon, the New York congressman said
he would take his chances in the clump of primaries in the South
and elsewhere on March 8.
   ``I'm in this all the way to New Orleans'' and the GOP
convention in August, said Kemp in Beaufort, S.C.
   ``It is on to Atlanta'' and the Democratic convention in July,
echoed Simon at a Washington news conference.
   Simon, the Illinois senator, has yet to win a Democratic event,
watching Massachusetts Michael Dukakis and Missouri Rep. Richard
Gephardt split the early contests. So he said he will skip the
South and focus on his home state primary on March 15, one week
after Super Tuesday.
   ``The campaign will begin anew after Super Tuesday, starting in
Illinois,'' Simon said.
   Money is the problem Simon sees in the South.
   ``There is no sense in my fooling myself,'' the Illinois
Democrat said. ``We just don't have the money.''
   Simon's campaign plunged into debt before the New Hampshire
primary, but he has collected close to half a million dollars in
the past two weeks.
   ``We have had record-breaking fund-raising,'' Simon said.
``Monday, for example, $137,000 came in. We never had a day like
that before. But you take $137,000 and then look at 20 states and
what it would cost for a media buy, and you're talking about
something that is nowhere near adequate.''
   ``I'm not writing off the South. I want my friends there to vote
for me,'' Simon added. ``I'm realistic about resources. I simply
cannot do everything.''
   On the Republican side, Kemp said he was outspent in the Tuesday
contests in South Dakota and Minnesota, but that would not happen
in the South. Senate GOP leader Bob Dole won both contests, with
former evangelist Pat Robertson coming in second. Vice President
George Bush trailed.
   ``We beat Bush in Minnesota. ... I was outspent 8-to-1 by Dole
and probably 10-to-1 by Robertson. We're going to match them
dollar-for-dollar in the South and in South Carolina,'' Kemp said.
   Kemp's hopes have been badly shaken by Robertson's strong
showing in the early caucus states. And Robertson has said that he
will win the South Carolina primary on March 5, the door-opener to
the Super Tuesday primaries.
   ``I think last night proved the race is wide open. That's all I
really needed. I needed to break up the idea that this is a
Bush-Dole race. This is no longer a Bush-Dole race,'' Kemp added.
   Kemp finished second in Michigan, third in New Hampshire and
Minnesota and fourth in Iowa and South Dakota.
   Among the Democrats, Simon said he has concluded that the Super
Tuesday contests will continue the early pattern of confusing
results with no clear front-runner emerging _ leading to a brokered
convention in Atlanta.
   ``Super Tuesday is likely to result in a very mixed picture,''
he said. ``Phase one of the selection process ends on March 8. ...
But we do not have the resources for winning in the Super Tuesday
states.''
   ``Phase two of the selection process begins March 15. I shall
use phase two to deliver the message that we must become a nation
with leadership characterized by compassion and vision and common
sense. It is on to Atlanta with that message.''
   He cited ``growing evidence that for the first time in recent
history there will be no first-ballot winner at the Democratic
convention.''
   Simon claimed he was in second place in the delegate count, but
the AP count places Simon in third place with 33 delegates, behind
Dukakis with 44.5 and Gephardt with 39. Simon aides said he is
claiming delegates out of Minnesota, even though the returns
allocating the delegates there will not be known until March 8.
   Simon is on the ballot in all the Super Tuesday primaries, but
he said he will do little or no campaigning in those states _
except for the nationally televised debates that are a major
feature of the next two weeks.
   Simon's best day so far was in Iowa on Feb. 8, where he finished
a very close second to Gephardt. He was third in New Hampshire and
then fourth in the Tuesday contests.

<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the networks have decided that the Super
Tuesday primary is so unlikely to produce a clear winner in the
presidential nominating races that they are cutting back on their
planned prime-time coverage.
   CBS had planned to pre-empt its entire prime-time schedule for
Super Tuesday coverage on March 8, but decided Tuesday to cut back
to two hours. NBC, which had planned a two-hour special, cut it to
one hour.
   ``The reasoning is that after Iowa and New Hampshire, we
determined that Super Tuesday was not going to be as conclusive as
previously thought,'' said NBC News spokesman Bill McAndrew. ``In
planning coverage, we protectively booked two hours and decided we
could cover it comprehensively in one.''
   Gene F. Jankowski, president of the CBS Broadcast Group, said
the network decided the public wasn't interested enough in the
primary results to spend more than two hours.
   ``What we did was took a look at the public's attitude in Iowa,
what the public's reaction to the coverage in New Hampshire was and
did a reevaluation of what the reaction was going to be to the
primaries that take place on March 8 and said to ourselves, from an
editorial point of view and journalistic point of view, can we
really fill three hours in a meaningful way that the audience would
want to watch?'' he said.
   ABC was sticking to its plan to have two hours of coverage,
despite the fact that Tuesday is its highest-rated night of
prime-time programming. CNN will have comprehensive coverage
throughout the evening, beginning at 6 p.m. EST.
   On PBS, ``The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour'' will wait until
Wednesday to assess the results.
   ``Because we're not stupid, we're going to avoid projecting or
predicting what may happen,'' said associate editor Jim Lehrer.
``It is so diverse and diffused down there, who knows what all of
these many, many results are going to add up to when it's all said
and done.''
   This is the first year for Super Tuesday, when 20 states, most
of them in the South, will select delegates to the two presidential
nominating conventions. Coverage of the event, stretching from
Massachusetts to American Samoa, has confounded the networks, who
are additionally hampered by budget cutbacks in the news divisions.
   Before the presidential campaign began, the networks believed
Super Tuesday would likely clinch the race in one or both parties.
But after the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary failed to
produce clear frontrunners, the networks decided Super Tuesday was
less likely to be decisive.
   ``The networks are backing and filling. They're less sure than
they were that we'll actually know who the nominee will be,'' said
ABC correspondent Jeff Greenfield. ``You have to assume at present
it's going to be an extremely diffuse result. We may come out of
this not knowing a thing.''

<TEXT>
   President Reagan on Wednesday sent Congress
the ``Truth in Federal Spending Act'' aimed at attacking budget
deficits with a pay-as-you-go approach to new programs.
   The legislative proposal is part of the ``economic bill of
rights'' Reagan announced last July. It would force the executive
and legislative branches to spell out the costs of programs and
legislation.
   Reagan said the bill ``will help us carry out the important
goals'' reflected in the deficit-reduction accord reached in the
aftermath of the Oct. 19 Wall Street crash.
   Faced with indications of growing investor uneasiness with
red-ink budgets, Reagan and leading lawmakers signed the Nov. 20
agreement calling for a two-year, $76 billion reduction program.
   That accord also provided for $9 billion in tax increases in
fiscal 1988, which began Oct. 1, and $14 billion in fiscal 1989.
   In asking for enactment of the truth-in-spending bill, Reagan
said the agreement with congressional leaders ``reflects a strong
consensus that federal spending must be brought under control.''
   ``Protecting the federal budget from special interest,
budget-busting legislation requires a continued, ongoing
commitment,'' he said in a message to Congress. ``Despite recent
encouraging efforts to bring the federal budget deficit under
control, major problems persist.''
   The truth-in-spending proposal was among several Reagan unveiled
last July 3 in a speech at the Jefferson Memorial here.
   Other components of the so-called ``economic bill of rights''
included a balanced budget amendment and line-item veto authority
for presidents. It also contained a proposal to require a
``super-majority'' vote, rather than a simple majority, for
enactment of tax hikes.
   The truth-in-spending legislation would require executive
agencies and the Congress to submit legislation and programs that
are ``revenue neutral.''
   Each piece of legislation would have to be accompanied by a
financial impact statement showing how much it would cost, and
proposing concurrent cuts in other programs, or increases in
federal revenues, to cover the costs.
   Reagan said in his message he wanted to make it clear that there
is no intent in the legislation ``simply to shift'' the costs of
legislation from the federal to state and local governments.
   In another development, Reagan budget director James C. Miller
III said the president will not propose legislation to rescind
pork-barrel spending as he promised in his State of the Union
address.
   ``It will not be in the form of a package of rescissions, but a
list'' for Congress to review, he told the Senate Appropriations
Committee. The president will be ``leaving it up to you, members of
Congress,'' he said.
   If the president proposed rescissions, those accounts would be
frozen for 45 days while Congress decided whether to make the cuts
permanent in a process with procedural advantages. The list,
however, would have no force of law.
   Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore., criticized the administration for
focusing so much attention on small items that ``really add up to a
hill of beans'' compared to the huge budget deficit problems.
``Every dollar counts,'' he said, ``But keep matters in
perspective.''
   Hatfield also complained that the administration touts its own
initiatives _ such as buying new leather flight jackets for the
military _ as good government while congressional priorities become
``pork barrel.''

   Former Colorado Gov. Richard Lamm says the next
president of the United States could end up in history books like
Herbert Hoover, who was the nation's leader during the Great
Depression.
   ``I think there is a four-out-of-10 chance that it's 1929 over
again,'' Lamm said Tuesday in an address to journalism students at
the University of Denver.
   Lamm, who practices law, also teaches at the university.
   ``I think there is a six-out-of-10 chance that it's a very
severe recession that's going to cause lots of trouble,'' he said.
   Lamm said he's not sure if any of the current presidential
candidates are willing to take the tough steps he thinks are needed
to deal with the nation's economic problems, including massive
cutbacks in the federal budget.
   He was asked by one student if he ever considered himself
presidential timber.
   ``Would I like to run for president of the United States?'' Lamm
said. ``I not only would not like to run for president of the
United States, but if the good fairy godmother would come down
tomorrow and offer me the presidency of the United States for the
next four years, I would say `no.'''

   The chairmen of both major political parties
are supporting a National Student-Parent Mock Election scheduled
for Nov. 3, five days before the real election that will determine
the next president.
   Two million students and parents took part in the 1984 mock
election, picking President Reagan as did the general electorate.
   The organizers, based in Tucson, Ariz., have the support of 46
national civic, religious and educational organizations, and former
presidents Ford and Carter are honorary chairmen.
   Both Frank J. Fahrenkopf, Jr., chairman of the Republican
National Committee, and Paul Kirk, chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, joined in a statement urging educators to
support the mock election.
   It is open to students of all ages, from kindergarten through
college. Participants will meet at local, state and national
``election headquarters'' on the Thursday before Election Day to
cast votes for federal offices and to make recommendations on key
national issues.
   The party chairmen said it was one way to help overcome youth
apathy about voting.
   Four out of five eligible voters under age 30 never bothered to
go to the polls in the last election, Kirk said.

<HEAD>`Nixon in `88' Buttons Sell Well at GOP Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A political activist peddled one of
the most popular pins at last weekend's state Republican
convention: ``Nixon in 88.''
   Mary Stanley of Fresno, Calif., said she had sold more than 600
of them at other political events around the nation this year.
   The pins are popular with conservatives ``who wish he was doing
our negotiating with the Russians instead of the people we have
now,'' said Stanley, who made news in 1984 when she resigned from
the state Republican Central Committee to support Democrat
Geraldine Ferraro for vice president.
   She said many people also buy the Nixon buttons for fun or
because they can't decide which of this year's crop of Republican
presidential candidates to support.
   ``It's a fun thing,'' she said. ``With this button, they know
they aren't going to get in trouble.''

<TEXT>
   A Moslem guerrilla leader said
Wednesday that the United States has struck a secret deal with
Moscow to betray the insurgents fighting to overthrow Afghanistan's
Soviet-backed government.
   Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, head of the extremist Islamic Party
guerrilla group, reiterated his vow to keep fighting in Afghanistan
until peace is forged on the insurgents' terms.
   Speaking to reporters and diplomats, he said evidence of
Washington's alleged betrayal was its acceptance of Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's offer to begin removing Red Army troops from
Afghanistan on May 15 if a U.N.-sponsored peace accord is signed
next month.
   Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan in December 1979, and by
Western estimates 115,000 are still there.
   Hekmatyar said the Soviet pullout would leave the country in the
hands of the communist Kabul government, making it impossible for
the nearly 5 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iran to return
home.
   ``I don't think Gorbachev (made the offer) without making a deal
with the Americans,'' he said.
   Pakistan recently has insisted that any U.N. accord on foreign
intervention in the Afghan conflict include an agreement that an
interim government would be installed in Kabul during the
withdrawal.
   Asked why he thought the United States would betray the
guerrillas after supporting them throughout the war, Hekmatyar
said, ``That's an impertinent question.''
   Asked whether his group would continue to accept U.S. military
aid, he said, ``Nobody can buy us or sell us out.''
   The Mujahedeen Alliance, comprising the seven political factions
of the insurgents, this week announced its own blueprint for a
government to replace the Soviet-backed one in Kabul.
   It envisons a joint executive committee composed of all seven
guerrilla leaders to preside over a 28-member cabinet composed of
mujahedeen, Afghan refugees and ``Moslems presently living in
Kabul.''
   The plan says the head of the cabinet would also be head of
state but it did not suggest who would have that post.
   Hekmatyar's said that if Pakistan, the mujahedeen's
headquarters, signed a U.N. accord without the guerrillas'
approval, they might change their external operating base to Iran.
   The next round of peace talks is scheduled to begin March 2 in
Geneva. Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan, and Kabul have been the
principal negotiators in the talks.
   Pakistan has indicated it might not sign any agreement until a
new government is installed in Kabul.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Dollar Decline Has Opened Opportunities for US
Exporters</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan said Wednesday the decline in
the value of the dollar has opened opportunities for U.S. exporters
but they could be undermined by protectionist legislation being
considered in Congress.
   ``The fact that the dollar's exchange rate is at a far more
realistic level is of great significance'' to the market for U.S.
exports, the president told members of Export Now, a public-private
group organized by the Commmerce Department.
   ``New opportunities are emerging because of the adjustment in
the value of the dollar,'' he said. ``At the current exchange rates
many American companies can now quote a lower price to customers in
Hamburg, Antwerp or Osaka than their competitors and still make a
higher profit than on sales in the domestic market.''
   In addition, he said, ``In the last few years, American industry
has been going through an unprecedented period of renovation,
computerization and modernization.''
   ``What we don't need now, however, is protectionisn that
undermines all the progress we've made,'' the president said.
   ``I strongly urge Congress to send me a trade bill that does not
imperil our ability to export by causing other countries to close
their markets,'' he said. ``We shouldn't shoot ourselves in the
foot after we have worked so hard and are in a position to win the
race.''
   The president said legislation being considered by a
House-Senate conference committee contains provisions that
encourage exports ``and we don't want to lose those.''
   But he said other provisions would violate the General Agreement
on Trade and Tariffs and make U.S. business less competitive.
   ``We ask for your support to ensure that we don't end up with an
economy-killing, protectionist bill,'' Reagan told the group.
   Secretary of Commerce William Verity introduced Reagan, saying
he was to ``make introductory remarks and wave the flag.''
   Verity said the president had told him ``in no uncertain terms''
that the Comemrce Department would lead an effort to expand sale of
U.S. goods overseas. The commerce secretary said there ``has been a
tremendous improvement in the climate for exporting.'' He
attributed that to an exchange rate that favors the United States
and to an administration in Washington ``that cares and would like
to do more'' to stimulate U.S. sales abroad.

   WASHINGTON _ Republicans angrily complained of ``banana
republic'' tactics Wednesday after armed Capitol police broke into
GOP Sen. Bob Packwood's locked office, arrested him and hauled him
feet-first into the Senate chamber during an all-night filibuster
over Democratic campaign finance legislation.
   On a motion by Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.,
Sergeant at Arms Henry K. Giugni was handed warrants for the arrest
of absent Republican senators, thus forcing them to answer a quorum
call and keep the filibuster alive.
   It was after midnight, more than 10 hours after the filibuster
began, when Giugni and five armed plainclothes Capitol policemen
began stalking Senate hideaways and senators' suites in nearby
office buildings.
   Giugni found several senators' offices empty but saw Sen. Steve
Symms, R-Idaho, running down a hallway to escape arrest. Then in an
extraordinary incident that the Senate historian said had not
occurred since 1942, Giugni used a passkey to unlock Packwood's
office door.
   Bob Witeck, a spokesman for the Oregon Republican, said Packwood
resisted and somehow jammed a finger he had broken two weeks ago in
a fall. ``He tried to hold the door closed with his shoulder, but
they were able to push it open,'' Witeck said.
   ``I had to shove in the door to get into his office,'' said
Giugni, a stocky Army veteran of World War II and former vice squad
policeman in Honolulu. ``I think he hurt his finger. He was very
courteous.''
   Packwood walked with Giugni and his police escort a block or so
from the Russell Senate Office Building to the Senate wing of the
Capitol but refused to ``walk on the floor willingly,'' Witeck said.
   At that point, three policemen grabbed Packwood by his ankles
and both arms and carried him bodily into the Senate chamber, feet
first. Packwood later went to a hospital, where X-rays showed that
his left hand _ enclosed in a cast _ had not been reinjured during
the scuffle with Giugni.
   ``I rather enjoyed it,'' Packwood told reporters later. ``I
instructed four of my staff to bring a sedan chair. But except for
the honor of it, I'd rather walk.''
   Packwood said he bolt-locked his main office door after his
staff reported that Giugni would try to arrest him.
   The senator said ``it sounded like a battering ram'' at the
door, with his shoulder pushing from inside against three shoulders
on the other side. ``Their mass beat my mass,'' Packwood said,
adding that he suffered only swollen knuckles.
   Giugni served the arrest warrant signed by the presiding
officer, Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., after 1 a.m.
   On a more serious note, Packwood said the campaign spending bill
has no chance of becoming law, because Senate Republicans have more
than enough votes to sustain a certain veto by President Reagan,
and that Byrd succeeded only in alienating his GOP colleagues.
   Packwood's arrest provoked angry clashes between Democrats and
Republicans. Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said the incident brought
to mind the police-state measures of ``Nazi Germany and communist
Russia.'' He protested that Packwood was hustled into the Senate
chamber like a ``common criminal.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, complained of ``banana republic''
tactics, and said Packwood's arrest ``flaunted the Constitution of
the United States.'' He proposed a change in the Senate rules to
forbid any future arrest of absentee senators.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., responded that Republican senators had
engaged in a ``shameful display'' of fleeing the chamber to avoid a
quorum call, requiring Giugni to search them down like a
``headmaster chasing schoolchildren.''
   ``Senators went off in a dead sprint,'' said Sen. Dale Bumpers,
D-Ark. ``They should have been in Calgary in one of the Olympic
events.''
   The incident was prompted by a walkout by Republican senators
from the filibuster that they had started in opposition to the
Democratic proposal to impose voluntary spending limits in general
election campaigns for the Senate.
   The Republicans charge that the bill was a Democratic attempt to
discriminate against them in states with a heavy Democratic edge in
registered voters. They began a filibuster early Tuesday afternoon
to prevent the Democratic majority from bringing the bill to a
floor vote they are virtually certain to win.
   But when the GOP senators failed to answer repeated quorum calls
requiring the presence of a majority of no fewer than 51 senators,
Byrd invoked a parliamentary rule that requires every senator to
attend floor sessions unless excused. After a series of roll calls
failed to lure Republicans back to the floor, Byrd moved to have
the sergeant at arms arrest the absentees and escort them to the
chamber.
   His motion was approved, 45-3, with dissenting votes cast by
Democrats Howell Heflin and Richard Shelby of Alabama and Dennis
DeConcini of Arizona. The arrest warrants were signed by Adams, who
was presiding over the Senate at the time.
   Byrd said later he had no choice but to resort to the arrest
tactic because only 50 senators _ one short of a majority _ had
answered the last quorum call and three Democrats were unavoidably
absent. He appealed for an end to the Republicans' ``guerrilla
warfare'' against the bill.
   The Senate rules provide that the sergeant at arms can be
ordered to ``request'' or ``compel'' the attendance of absentees.
If that doesn't work, the Senate can ``direct the sergeant at arms
or his deputies to arrest absent senators and bring them to the bar
of the Senate.''
   Democrats and Republicans have been at loggerheads for nearly a
year over the Democratic proposal, which has 52 co-sponsors, to
impose voluntary Senate campaign spending limits of $950,000 to
$5.5 million, depending on a state's population.
   Under the bill, a candidate who observes the voluntary spending
limit would get campaign funds from the Treasury if an opponent
exceeded the limit or an independent group spent large amounts of
money in opposition.
   Senate historian Richard Baker said the last time something
similar to the Packwood incident ocurred was on Nov. 23, 1942, when
a deputy sergeant at arms carried a subpoena to the Mayflower Hotel
and escorted Sen. Kenneth McKellar, D-Tenn., to the Senate floor
for a vote on poll tax legislation.

   U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz will
find Israel deeply divided over how best to approach peace
negotiations with the Arabs.
   Shultz's mission will take him to neighboring Arab states, but
he will also have to shuttle between conservative Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir and his liberal Foreign Minister Shimon Peres.
   It may be difficult to wring concessions from Shamir. Many in
his Likud Bloc are grumbling about the American timing, worried
that any change of position will create the impression that Israel
is giving in to Arab rioters.
   ``The country is in a very defiant mood,'' said a Shamir
adviser, adding that any hint of U.S. pressure would likely
backfire.
   The Shamir aide said he doubted an agreement on starting
negotiations with the Arabs was not possible in the five days
Shultz has set aside for his trip.
   A more upbeat assessment came from Yossi Beilin,
director-general of the Foreign Ministry.
   ``We are welcoming the initiative. We are welcoming the timing.
We understand, all of us, that there is no military solution for
the uprising in the territories but only a peaceful solution,''
Beilin said.
   ``I am far from thinking that it is an impossible mission,'' he
added.
   The main difference between Peres and Shamir is over whether
Israel should exchange territory captured in the 1967 Middle East
war for peace with the Arabs. The two also disagree over whether
Israel should participate in an international peace conference.
   Peres favors the return of some land and has agreed to Jordanian
King Hussein's demand for an international conference.
   Shamir opposes returning land and argues an international
conference would be a biased forum and would give the Soviet Union
too great a say.
   Shultz has tried to find middle ground in one disagreement by
proposing that Arab-Israeli talks be launched at an ``international
event.''
   Shamir, who has accepted the idea of Soviet-American auspices,
has not closed the door to Shultz's proposal but asked the
secretary for clarification on what kind of format he has in mind.
   To satisfy the Arabs, Shultz needs Israeli approval for a
land-for-peace trade.
   But his mention of this formula in a recent speech irritated
Shamir and prompted him to send emissaries to Washington to stress
that no pledge to give up land would be made in advance.
   ``Shamir hinted at the possibility that he was ready to
negotiate territory. We are ready to negotiate on the territorial
issue, but that doesn't mean we are ready to agree in advance to
withdraw (from occupied lands),'' said Yossi Olmert, a legislator
Shamir sent to talk with Shultz.
   A senior Israel official who demanded anonymity said Shultz
would try to hammer out guidelines for Arab-Israeli talks on both a
temporary and a permament solution in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The first obstacle he faces in this quest is a U.S.-proposed,
yearlong timetable designed to get the process moving before U.S.
and Israeli elections in November.
   According to his schedule, an international conference would
convene in April. Elections for a Palestinian self-rule council
would follow in October, and in December, talks would begin on a
final settlement.
   Shultz's formula is designed to overcome Arab suspicions that
negotiations would never move beyond the limited autonomy idea, a
concept rejected by the Palestinians since it was first proposed in
the 1978 Camp David Accords.
   The Palestinians seek an independent state, which is opposed by
Israelis on both the right and left.
   Shamir has demanded a confidence-building period of several
years to set the stage for talks on a final disposition of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Not even the most optimistic Israelis are predicting Shultz will
iron out the final guidelines for talks during his visit. The best
they hope for is an ``initial breakthrough'' that will set the
stage for further trips by Shultz or other U.S. officials.
   Shultz was dealt an early setback when Palestinian moderates
were banned by Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization
from meeting with the secretary in Jerusalem.
   Without Palestinian participation, the new U.S. peace initiative
is unlikely to have the desired calming effect on rioting in the
occupied lands.
   In fact, his visit may have the opposite effect. Responding to
leaflets calling for anti-Shultz protests, a general strike was
launched on the eve of Shultz's visit and Israeli security
officials are preparing for an escalation of violence.

   A man who allegedly made a false report
that he was in the wreckage of a plane crash was indicted on a
federal charge Wednesday.
   U.S. Attorney Richard Wiebusch said Mark Blair, 29, would face
up to five years in prison and a fine if convicted on the charge of
making a false statement to a federal government agency.
   Blair is accused of talking by radio for four hours with an
airborne Navy plane on Jan. 8, saying that he was aboard a small
jet that crashed near Meredith, killing one and injuring three. The
Navy plane also detected intermittent beeping from an emergency
locator transmitter.
   Officials said as many as 100 people, 15 planes, five
helicopters, six police agencies, a snowmobile club and search dogs
joined in the search for the aircraft. Harold Buker, state
aeronautics director, said the search may have cost as much as
$50,000.
   Blair, who was arrested Blair at his apartment four days after
the hoax, already faces a state misdemeanor charge.

   The later life of Josephine Baker, the
American entertainer known as ``the darling of Paris'' in the Jazz
Age, is documented in a collection of personal papers, photographs
and clippings acquired by the Yale University library.
   The collection was assembled by Harry Harford Janes of England,
who died last year before he could complete a biography of her.
Yale's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library bout the
collection at auction in London in December.
   ``I knew that she was of ongoing interest,'' Patricia Willis,
Beinecke curator of American literature, said Wednesday.
   Baker, who died in 1975 at age 69, was known for her opulent
costumes, singing and exotic dancing in the Folies Bergere in the
1920s.
   The St. Louis native first dazzled French audiences in 1925 in
her performance in the Revue Negre, or the black review, when she
dressed in scarlet ostrich plumes and danced on a mirrored drum.
   That role, along with her love of the exotic, illustrated by a
daily stroll down the Champs Elysees with her leashed pet leopard,
earned her another nickname _ ``siren of the tropics.''
   ``She was the first to have highly unusual costumes and to work
with a chorus that was extravagantly beautiful, making a whole
image of the stage,'' Willis said.
   The Yale collection, acquired in December, focuses on the second
half of her life, beginning with her work entertaining Allied
troops during World War II, Willis said.
   The collection includes letters from Princess Grace of Monaco,
and photographs and articles from the French and British press.
   Baker and her husband, Jo Bouillion, adopted 12 children whom
they dubbed their ``rainbow tribe.'' One picture shows Baker with
the entire clan by a swimming pool at Les Milandes, their home in
southern France.
   Willis said she did not know if a collection of papers
documenting Baker's earlier life exists, and she said she did now
know of any major biography of her.
   The papers have become part of the Beinecke's James Weldon
Johnson Collection of Negro Arts and Letters in the library's
American literature collection.

<TEXT>
   A test of a redesigned nozzle-to-case
joint for the space shuttle booster rocket was set for Wednesday
despite computer problems which forced a delay.
   The six-second test, the fourth of six Nozzle Joint Environment
Simulator experiments and one of hundreds of tests of booster
rocket components, was rescheduled for 3 p.m. MST at the Wasatch
Operations plant of Morton Thiokol Inc., 25 miles west of here.
   The joint was deliberately flawed to allow hot gases to blow
past bonded adhesive insulation and one of three O-rings to reach
the craft's main seal, or primary O-ring, said company spokesman
Rocky Raab.
   He said the test was designed to evaluate the main seal's
ability to contain any gases that might leak through the insulation
and a ``wiper'' O-ring during a launch.
   The test had been scheduled for 1 p.m. but was delayed because
of unspecified problems with a ground computer, Raab said.
   Engineers concluded after the third test of the joint on Oct. 8
that the O-ring system withstood gas pressure after a deliberate
flaw was built into the joint, which connects the nozzle to the
body of the segmented booster rocket.
   However, during a full-scale test on Dec. 23, a ``blow hole''
was detected in the joint's adhesive sealant _ a defect NASA had
not built into the test but one which officials described as ``very
benign.''
   For Wednesday's test, engineers created a quarter-inch by
five-hundredths-inch hole through the bonded insulation and damaged
the wiper O-ring _ two flaws aligned to assure a gas path in the
joint up to the primary seal.
   Raab said the double defects would subject the joint to ``a
little bit more severe'' conditions than previous tests.
   ``Again, it's another step in the process of ensuring that this
is a fail-safe and fault-tolerant design,'' Raab said. ``It builds
our experience base on the behavior of the joint, and it also
serves as a precursor for the April full-size motor firing, which
will have similar flaws,'' Raab said.
   Blow holes can occur during assembly of the 126-foot rocket,
``so it happens here at the factory, if it happens,'' he said.
   Raab said the test simulates ``the most difficult portion of the
environment for the O-rings, that is the first one second'' of
launch.
   The solid-fuel rocket booster was redesigned following the Jan.
28, 1986, explosion of the shuttle Challenger. The disaster, which
killed the craft's seven-member crew, was blamed on a faulty seal
in a booster joint that allowed hot gases to escape and ignite the
shuttle's external fuel tank.
   While the blow hole detected in December was not considered a
major problem, the failure of a nozzle boot ring during the same
test prompted National Aeronautics and Space Administration
officials to push back the June 2 target date for resuming shuttle
flights.
   The launch of Discovery is now planned sometime in August.
   In addition to the final two NJES tests scheduled before shuttle
flights resume, NASA and Morton Thiokol will conduct several more
Joint Environment Simulator Tests of the booster rocket and three
more full-scale horizontal tests, the first one tentatively set for
early April, Raab said.

<HEAD>Filing Tax Forms Through Computers Speeds Returns, IRS Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Up to 1 million taxpayers will receive federal
refunds as much as three weeks earlier this year by having a
professional file their tax returns directly into the IRS computer.
   Already this year, 119,494 returns have been filed
electronically _ compared with 77,612 for the entire filing season
in 1987. If the taxpayers choose, their refunds will be deposited
directly into their bank account.
   Although the number of electronic returns are up considerably
this year, the volume of ordinary, paper returns filed so far is
6.7 percent below last year's pace. However, the gap _ which
officials blame partially on the new tax law _ is closing each week.
   Through Feb. 19, the Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday,
23.55 million returns had been filed, compared with 25.24 million a
year ago. The IRS has processed 9.74 million of this year's
returns, up slightly from 9.72 million last year.
   The inventory of unprocessed return totaled 13.8 million last
week, compared with 15.5 million a year ago.
   The number of returns qualifying for refunds is down 14.4
percent, a decline that IRS officials cannot explain. Through last
week, 3.8 million refunds had been certified; the figure was almost
4.5 million at this time last year.
   The average refund is bigger this year: $782 compared with $727.
By the time all 107 million individual returns are filed this year,
the IRS estimates, nearly 80 percent will qualify for refunds
averaging about $1,000.
   It is taking the IRS about five weeks to process a return and
certify a refund check this year. But those taxpayers who file
electronically are getting refunds within two or three weeks.
   This is the third year of electronic filing, and within three or
four more years, says Richard F. Moran, who manages the project,
about 35 million returns will be filed annually by computer.
   Electronic returns save the IRS considerable time, said Moran,
and these returns generally have fewer errors that would delay a
refund. The IRS estimates electronic filing could save $200 million
in processing and storage costs over the next 10 years.
   And if a taxpayer who files electronically chooses to have the
refund deposited directly into a bank account, that saves the
treasury 23 cents that would have been spent to issue and mail a
paper check.
   So far, electronic filing is available only to taxpayers in 10
states and parts of four others who are due refunds and who pay any
of about 2,000 professional preparers to fill out their returns.
Although the preparer sends the completed return directly into the
IRS computer by telephone line, the taxpayer must sign a signature
form which is mailed to the IRS.
   Electronic filing is avaible in Alabama, Arizona, Indiana,
Kentucky, Nebraska, North Carolina, Utah, Virginia, Washington and
Wisconsin and in the Albany and Buffalo areas of New York, the
Sacramento and San Jose areas of California and the Cincinnati and
Dallas areas.
   All electronic returns are processed to IRS centers in Ogden,
Utah, or Cincinnati.

<HEAD>Boss Says Doctor Experimented on Comatose Patient</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An anesthesiologist performed experiments on a
comatose patient, his superior said Wednesday after France's health
minister suspended the doctor for experiments on another comatose
patient.
   On Tuesday, a professor of medicine testified in a criminal
trial in the western city of Poitiers that a doctor he did not
identify had placed a deeply comatose patient, considered legally
dead, on sabotaged medical equipoment.
   Professor Jean Lassner said the experiment was carried out to
see if the effects were the same in the case on trial, in which a
young woman died, possibly from medical sabotage.
   Maurice Peria, director of the Regional Hospital Center of
Amiens, said Wednesday that the experiment was carried out by Dr.
Alain Milhaud on 24-year-old man who had been in a deep coma since
late January. He said the man's family had been notified and the
patient survived the experiment.
   ``The experiment was videotaped and sent to Dr. Lassner so he
could use it at the trial,'' Peria said. He said Milhaud proceeded
without the consent of the hospital.
   Lassner gave his testimony in the trial of three doctors charged
in the 1984 death of Nicole Berneron after her operation for a
benign tumor at Jean Bernard Hospital in Poitiers.
   Mrs. Berneron, then 33 and the mother of two children,
apparently received nitrous oxide instead of oxygen after the
operation and died of asphyxiation. An investigation showed that
the tubes had been switched.
   Milhaud was condemned by the medical community after he admitted
experimenting in 1985 on a 20-year-old comatose man.
   Health Minister Michele Barzach on Wednesday ordered Milhaud
suspended from his duties in Amiens, north of Paris, and asked the
state prosecutor to investigate to find out who had carried out the
latest experiment.
   The minister, a doctor, said she was ``indignant and revolted
that in this country one can carry out experiments on humans,
obviously without their consent, given their state.''
   In comments during the 1985 controversy, Milhaud called patients
in a prolonged, chronic vegetative state ``almost perfect human
models, who constitute intermediaries between animal and man.''
   In the 1985 experiment, he injected in two minutes a quart of
blood into the patient's bone marrow to try to show this was a
viable treatment for patients in shock. The man, comatose for three
years, died within months but no link between the experiment and
the death was established.
   President Francois Mitterrand condemned human experimentation.
   ``Human beings are not instruments,'' he said. ``Neither the
search for truth nor scientific progress must distance us from this
certitude, this value of civilization.''

<HEAD>Panel Calls for Doubling Spending on Public Works</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation must double its spending on public
works projects ranging from highways to waste disposal plants to
keep them from falling into ruin, a government-appointed commission
said Wednesday.
   But in an era of high budget deficits and a push to reduce
spending, not increase it, there are few signs that either Congress
or the White House is prepared to embrace the call for spending
billions of additional dollars for such programs.
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., said he was introducing
legislation calling for an additional $5 billion a year in public
works spending, but aides acknowledged there is little chance the
bill would go far this election year.
   The White House gave little notice to the report by the National
Council on Public Works Improvement, although it appointed three of
its five members. The administration recently sent a proposed
fiscal 1989 budget to Congress calling for reduced highway and mass
transit spending.
   The special government council, created four years ago to
examine the nation's public works needs, concluded that ``the
quality of America's infrastructure is barely adequate to meet
current requirements and insufficient to meet the demands of future
economic growth'' without sharply increased spending.
   ``For America's public works, the yellow light is flashing. The
danger sign is apparent. There is serious and very real cause for
alarm,'' Joseph Giglio, the council's chairman and a Wall Street
investment banker.
   ``If we do not act to shore up our nation's infrastructure, we
could very soon be faced with enormous problems that imperil future
economic growth,'' Giglio said at a news conference.
   The report called for all levels of government and the private
sector to double their capital spending on public works projects
from an annual level of $45 billion to $90 billion by the end of
the century.
   The council criticized the federal government for hoarding funds
in various public works trust funds _ a cash balance of $24 billion
in 1987, according to the report _ but said additional revenue must
also be obtained.
   It suggested possible sources of new money ranging from higher
federal fuel taxes to local ``impact fees'' on developers.
   ``In most cases we cannot rely simply on wiser spending. We also
must generate additional sources of funding,'' the council declared.
   The five council members acknowledged that the call for billions
of dollars of increased spending for public works comes as a
variety of social programs, the military and other government needs
are competing for limited funds.
   ``To throw one more urgent monetary request into the pot may
seem foolhardy,'' said panel member Freeman Holmer, president of
Eugene, Ore., City Council. ``It is anything but. Ignoring our
infrastructure, the foundation of our economy, will be even more
costly in the long run.''
   The study also included a ``report card'' on progress made in
dealing with each major type of public works.
   The panel gave no failing grades. However, it raised serious
concerns about efforts to deal with toxic wastes, which received a
grade of D, as well as attempts to grapple with mass transit, solid
waste disposal and waste water treatment needs. All three areas
received a C or C-minus grade.
   Highway programs did a little better with a C-plus. Programs to
manage water resources was given a B, the best grade, followed by
B-minuses for aviation and water supply management.
   ``As a whole, this is a report card that would make most parents
weep,'' said council member Peter Goldmark Jr., a vice president of
the Times Mirror Co. of Los Angeles.
   Discussing hazardous wastes, the council said that while
spending to clean up contaminated sites has increased fivefold in
the last two years, ``only a small fraction of the 2 tons of waste
per capita produced in America each year is being treated safely.''
   On water quality, the council suggested that governments at all
levels have been fighting a losing battle. ``Despite (a) $44
billion federal investment in sewage treatment since 1972, water
quality has not improved significantly. ... due in part to
uncontrolled sources of pollution ...,'' it said.
   The report said overall spending on public works has declined
from 3.6 percent of the gross national product in 1960 to 2.6
percent in 1985. Money for public works programs accounted for 20
percent of total government spending in 1950, but only 7 percent in
1984, it said.
   ``In effect, we're drawing down past investments without making
commensurate investments of our own,'' the report said. ``Failure
to reverse this decline will exact a high price for the nation in
the future both in the cost of deferred investment and in reduced
economic competitiveness.''
   Other members of the council are Lowell B. Jackson, an
engineering consultant from Aurora, Colo., and Freida K. Wallison,
a Washington, D.C., lawyer.

   The arrest warrant used by the Senate to bring
Sen. Bob Packwood to the floor early Wednesday left no question
about what Sergeant-at-Arms Henry Giugni had to do.
   ``I had to take him in. I knew he was not going under his own
power,'' Giugni told reporters.
   The warrants given to Giugni listed missing Republican senators
individually by name:
   ``To Henry K. Giugni, Sergeant-at-Arms, United States Senate:
   The undersigned, presiding officer of the Senate, by virtue of
the power vested in me, hereby command you in pursuance of the
order of the Senate, this day made, to forthwith arrest and take
into custody and bring to the bar of the Senate, Bob Packwood, who
is absent without leave.
   Hereof fail not and make due return of this warrant.''
   The order was signed by the presiding officer, who at the time
was Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash.
   Packwood, R-Ore., was physically carried onto the floor after
Giugni and five detectives shoved their way into his office.
   Packwood later quipped to reporters, ``Real men don't get
arrested by Brock Adams.''

<TEXT>
   Here is a look at the major differences between
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on
peacemaking strategy and the plan by U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE _ Peres has agreed to Jordan's demand
that the five permament members of the U.N. Security Council meet
to start peace talks.
   Shamir opposes the idea, arguing such a forum would be weighted
against Israel and would give the Soviet Union too much of a say.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   LAND-FOR-PEACE _ Peres favors territorial compromise, returning
some of the land captured in the 1967 Middle East war for peace
agreements with Jordan, Syria and other Arab states.
   Shamir says he is willing to negotiate the territorial issue,
but he will not pledge in advance that Israel will return any land.
His party views the West Bank and Gaza Strip as essential to
Israel's security.
   Both leaders agree to giving Palestinians some form of autonomy
as a temporary solution in the occupied lands.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SHULTZ PLAN _ Shamir has expressed reservations, especially over
U.S. proposals to start talks by the end of the year on a final
disposition of the occupied lands. He insists the five-year interim
period called for in the Camp David Accords is needed to build
trust between the Palestinians and Israelis.
   Peres has not objected to any elements publicly.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOVIET INVOLVEMENT _ Peres has argued the Soviets are already
involved in the region. He conditions Soviet participation on a
significant change in the number of Jews allowed to come to Israel.
He has placed less emphasis on a demand for full diplomatic
relations.
   Shamir opposes any opening that will increase Soviet influence
and has insisted on full diplomatic relations and free emigration
for Soviet Jews as conditions for any Soviet role.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PLO _ Peres leaves open the possibility of talking to PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat if the Palestine Liberation Organization
ends all forms of violence against Israel and accepts the right of
the Jewish state to exist.
   Shamir rules out any dealings with PLO leaders.

<TEXT>
   Three Democratic presidential candidates could
lose future federal matching funds based on poor showings in the
South Dakota primary but they have 30 days to turn that around
before the money is cut off.
   Democrats Jesse Jackson, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and
former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart became ineligible for matching funds
by attaining less than 10 percent of the vote in two successive
primaries _ South Dakota on Tuesday and New Hampshire a week
earlier.
   But election law stays the actual cut-off of money for 30 days
after the second primary, giving the candidates a chance to
re-establish their matching fund status by doing better in a
subsequent primary.
   During the 30 days, the candidates can continue to receive
federal matching funds for every contribution of $250 or less that
they raise privately.
   ``There is absolutely no harm done to the campaign by this,''
said Gore spokesman Paul Risley. He added that Gore, by focusing
his campaign on the South, had never expected to do well in New
Hampshire or South Dakota but anticipated better results before the
30-day period ended.
   The candidates can regain eligibility by achieving a 20 percent
or better showing in a successive primary.
   That means they have a chance to redeem themselves on March 8
when the Super Tuesday series of 20 primaries occurs. Most of the
states are in the South, where both Jackson and Gore have strong
support.
   Jackson's campaign manager, Gerald Austin, said he anticipates
no problem in keeping matching-fund eligibility. He said that since
Jackson's respectable showing in Iowa's caucuses on Feb. 8, when he
came in fourth, the campaign has raised $400,000.
   Hart's possibilities are weaker. His campaign organization is
tiny and he raised only $70,000 during January.
   The matching money is distributed from an U.S. Treasury account
that is supported by the voluntary $1 checkoff on individual income
tax forms.
   GOP contender Pat Robertson dropped below the 10 percent
threshhold in New Hampshire, but he redeemed himself with a 20
percent showing in South Dakota.
   To be declared eligible initially by the FEC, a candidate must
raise $100,000 across 20 states in contributions of $250 or less.

<HEAD>Prince Charles Bans Aerosols From Household</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Charles said Tuesday he has banned the use
of aerosols in his household because of concern that they damage
the environment, and so far the only problem has been finding an
alternative to hair spray.
   Aerosols contain chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which float into the
stratosphere and attack the ozone layer, a 20-mile-deep belt of
protective gas around the Earth.
   ``We are always told that it is not scientifically proved,''
Charles said.
   ``But I, personally, as I have become older and more autocratic,
have banned the use of aerosols in my household.''
   In a light-hearted reference to his wife, Princess Diana, the
39-year-old heir to the British throne added:
   ``Trouble still remains with finding adequate and good enough
alternatives to hair spray _ as I am sure all husbands here will
find.''
   He spoke to representatives of businesses which won awards for
improving the environment under a program organized by the Royal
Society of Arts.
   He said the award-winners had found solutions to environmental
problems, ``so if anybody can come up with a really good answer, an
alternative to hair sprays, then for God's sake do so and I will
come and give the award next year.''
   The environmental group Friends of the Earth welcomed the
prince's action, but said he did not have to ban sprays completely
from his household.
   ``There are environmentally safe alternatives for every single
kind of spray, including hair spray,'' said Charles Secrett, a
spokesman for the group.
   Holes in the ozone layer allow the sun's ultraviolet rays to
reach the Earth, causing skin cancer and threatening to damage
crops and alter weather patterns.

<HEAD>Court Hears Case Stemming From Police Pursuit In Detroit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court was told Wednesday that
police should be allowed to pursue someone who starts running at
the sight of them without having any other reason to suspect a
crime has been committed.
   ``The alternative is for the police to shrug their shoulders and
let a crime occur,'' said Andrea L. Solak, an assistant state
prosecutor from Detroit.
   But Carole M. Stanyar, representing a man who started running
when he spotted a police cruiser on a Detroit street, said,
``People run from the police for a variety of reasons.'' She said
some people fear harassment, that they will be falsely accused of a
crime or ``they may not like the police.''
   The justices, hearing arguments in a case that could expand
police power to stop people on the street, reacted skeptically to
Ms. Stanyar's assrtions.
   ``Don't you think sound law enforcement would want (the police)
to see what's up?'' asked Justice Antonin Scalia.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall suggested that Ms. Stanyar's client,
Michael Mose Chesternut, initiated the chase. ``Could it be he had
a guilty conscience?'' Marshall said.
   Michigan authorities are seeking to reinstate as evidence drugs
dropped by Chesternut, who was standing on a Detroit street corner
talking to another man a little after midnight on Dec. 19, 1984,
when he saw the cruiser.
   Police said Chesternut immediately started running away and they
followed him in the car. After turning a corner and as the cruiser
drew alongside of him, Chesternut threw a number of packets to the
ground and then stopped.
   The officers said they picked up the packets, which appeared to
contain narcotics, and they then arrested Chesternut. He was
charged with possessing heroin, codeine and diazapan.
   A judge in Detroit threw the case out on grounds police lacked a
reasonable suspicion to pursue Chesternut and therefore seized the
evidence unlawfully.
   Michigan law enforcement officials said the judge may have
dismissed the case out of a concern for innocent joggers.
   Mrs. Solak argued Wednesday that the show of police authority
which apparently prompted Chesternut to drop the packets and stop
did not amount to an illegal search and seizure barred by the
Constitution's Fourth Amendment.
   She also said that when Chesternut dropped the packets he
abandoned any right of privacy he had to protect them from a police
search.
   Ms. Stanyar countered that Chesternut reasonably believed he was
being seized when police chased him and acted in ``an aggressive
and confrontational'' manner.
   ``Under the circumstances, a reasonable person would feel he was
not free to leave,'' she said. He was prevented from asserting
``his right to go on his way,'' she said.
   The Supreme Court previously has held that police must have a
reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing before stopping and questioning
someone in a public place. The court also has said police must have
more specific probable cause to believe a crime has been committed
when arresting or detaining someone.
   A ruling in the case argued Wednesday is expected by July.
   The case is Michigan vs. Chesternut, 86-1824.

   Vice President George Bush, saying ``you
can't win them all,'' said Wednesday he was disappointed but not
surprised by finishing third in South Dakota's Republican
presidential primary and fourth in Minnesota's GOP caucuses.
   ``I think the result was somewhat anticipated,'' he told
reporters, but ``you can't go everywhere.''
   In South Dakota on Tuesday, Bush finished behind Sen. Bob Dole
of Kansas and Pat Robertson, while Bush trailed Dole, Robertson and
Rep. Jack Kemp of New York in Minnesota.
   Bush won the New Hampshire primary Feb. 16 after coming in third
in Iowa's GOP caucuses Feb. 8 behind Dole and Robertson.
   ``We've done well out there,'' Bush said. ``We've won in
Michigan (at the convention Jan. 29-30) and in Nevada (in a
non-binding straw poll at caucuses Feb. 18). So you can't win them
all,'' he added.
   Bush is favored in Maine's Republican town caucuses this
weekend. Bush said that ``I think we have to do our best. The same
is true for all these Southern states'' in the March 8 Super
Tuesday balloting, which also includes primaries in Massachusetts
and Rhode Island.
   State Sen. Pamela Cahill, a leader of Dole's Maine campaign,
said he is ``still optimistic'' but she did not expect him to win;
instead, she said, at best, Dole will finish second or third in
Maine.
   Meanwhile, in Burlington, Vt., on Wednesday, Bush asked
Robertson to apologize or provide proof for suggestions that
political motivations were behind the timing of reports of sexual
misconduct by television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart.
   Robertson, a former TV evangelist, provided no evidence to
support his accusation on the timing, and declined to say who might
be behind any such effort. But he claimed Bush's campaign was the
only one in the GOP engaging in ``dirty tricks.'' Robertson said it
was odd that Swaggart's tearful confession of sin came just two
weeks before Super Tuesday.
   ``By sundown in the old South, I'd like to see him stand up like
a Southern gentleman with a little evidence,'' Bush said. ``I'd
like to see an apology or proof.''
   Bush was in Vermont to meet with supporters, and shook hands
with about 100 backers at Burlington airport. He said he was
looking for a victory in Vermont, which holds a non-binding
presidential primary next Tuesday.
   Asked whether he would support a regional approach to federal
dairy policy, a key issue in Vermont, Bush said he has not taken a
firm stand on the matter.

<HEAD>Official Says Bechtel Offered Discounted Oil for Promise Not to

<TEXT>
   The Bechtel Group Inc. offered in 1985 to sell
oil to Israel at a discount of at least $650 million for 10 years
if it promised not to bomb a proposed Iraqi pipeline, a Foreign
Ministry official said Wednesday.
   But then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres said the offer from Bruce
Rappaport, a partner in the San Francisco-based construction and
engineering company, was ``unimportant,'' the senior official told
The Associated Press.
   Peres, now foreign minister, never discussed the offer with
other government ministers, said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The comments marked the first time Israel has acknowledged any
offer was made for assurances not to bomb the planned $1 billion
pipeline, which was to have run near Israel's border with Jordan.
The pipeline was never built.
   In San Francisco, Tom Flynn, vice president for public relations
for the Bechtel Group, said the company did not make any offer to
Peres but that Rappaport, a Swiss financier, made it without
Bechtel's knowledge or consent.
   Another Bechtel spokesman, Al Donner, said Bechtel ``at no
point'' in development of the pipeline project had anything to do
with the handling of the oil. He said proposals submitted by the
company ``did not include any specific arrangements for the
handling of the oil or for the disposal of the oil once it reached
the terminal.''
   Asked about Bechtel's disclaimers after they were made in San
Francisco, the Israeli Foreign Ministry official said Peres
believed Rappaport made the offer for the company.
   ``Rappaport came to Peres as a representative of Bechtel and
said he was speaking on behalf of Bechtel,'' the official said.
``If he was not, he misrepresented himself.''
   The Jerusalem Post on Wednesday quoted sources close to Peres as
saying that according to Rappaport, Bechtel had said the oil sales
would have to be conducted through a third party to keep the sales
secret from Iraq and Jordan.
   The Foreign Ministry official said Peres did not take the offer
seriously.
   ``This is a man who sees 10 people every day,'' he said.
``Thirty percent of them come with crazy ideas. He just says, `Yes,
yes. We'll think about it.' That's how things work in Israel.''
   The offer appeared to be the one mentioned in a September 1985
memo to Attorney General Edwin Meese III. The memo referred to an
arrangement between Peres and Rappaport ``to the effect that Israel
will receive somewhere between $65 million and $70 million a year
for 10 years.''
   The memo from Meese friend E. Robert Wallach, Rappaport's
attorney, also states, ``What was also indicated to me, and which
would be denied everywhere, is that a portion of those funds will
go directly to Labor,'' a reference to the political party Peres
leads.
   The Wallach memo has become the focus of an investigation into
whether Meese knew of a possibly improper payment. Peres has denied
any wrongdoing and has denounced the memo as ``complete nonsense.''
   The Israeli official said Rappaport, a native of Israel and a
close friend of Peres, relayed the offer to Peres earlier in
September.
   ``Peres thought the offer was unimportant. For him, the most
important thing was to have an Iraqi oil port near Israel's
border,'' the official said.
   ``The thinking was that this would put Iraq in a position where
it would not be able to wage war with Israel, out of concern for
its pipeline.''
   A person answering the telephone at Rappaport's Swiss residence
said he was out of town and could not be reached for comment.

<HEAD>U.S. Seamen Free Whale Trapped in Fishing Nets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sailors from an American guided-missile
cruiser risked their lives in a three-hour operation to free a
30-ton sperm whale tangled in fishing nets in the Arabian Sea, U.S.
officials said Tuesday.
   At one point, Lt.j.g. James M. Syvertsen of Wading River, N.Y.,
rode the back of the 40-foot mammal like ``something out of a
rodeo'' while cutting the nylon cords, according to a Navy news
release issued in Manama.
   He was one of four divers who went into the water to cut the
nets loose in the dangerous operation Sunday.
   In the end, the female whale was freed and swam off, with one
last piece of line dangling ``like dental floss'' between its
teeth, according to Capt. Clinton J. Coneway, skipper of the
cruiser Truxtun..
   ``Through the ordeal the whale made no attempts to harm the
swimmers. It seemed that she knew they were trying to help,'' said
Coneway. ``All in all it was a most unusual and rewarding way to
spend a Sunday afternoon. Jacques Cousteau would be proud.''
   The rescue occurred after crewmen aboard a helicopter from the
nuclear-powered carrier Enterprise spotted the whale floating
listlessly. The helicopter was on a routine patrol and the crew
dropped smoke flares to mark the spot for the Truxtun, which was 30
miles away.
   The two ships are part of a U.S. battle group that arrived in
the Arabian Sea earlier this month to support naval operations in
the Persian Gulf.
   The helicopter crewmen said they thought the whale was dead
until they ``saw water spouting from its blowhole,'' according to
Petty Officer James Cox, a rescue specialist aboard the helicopter.
   Rear Adm. Guy Zeller, commander of the Enterprise's escort
group, ordered the Truxtun to the scene.
   Its crew used grappling hooks to snag the net and pull the tired
animal next to the ship where they worked to remove the net. The
Navy said the nylon net was a type used by fishermen in the area,
but it was ``of unknown orgin.''
   Curtis Michitsch of Reno, Nev., was lowered in a sling to cut
the nets.
   When he became exhausted, he was replaced by Seaman Gerald
Samples of Wilbur, Neb.
   Although they appeared to have nearly freed the whale, which
swam a short distance away, Coneway said he feared the animal still
might not survive because of the the remaining nets and he
dispatched a whaleboat to overtake it.
   Syvertsen, one of two volunteers, became entangled in the net
for about 15 minutes, and finally was relieved by Seaman Adam
Webber, a rescue swimmer from Portland, Maine, who finished the
task.
   Coneway said he doubted at first his sailors would be able to
free the whale from the ``tangled mess,'' but ``I completely
underestimated the ingenuity, perseverance and courage of Truxtun's
swimmers and deck force.''

<TEXT>
   About 5,000 lawyers marched on
Parliament on Wednesday to demand the ouster of India's top
policewoman, and they vowed to continue a strike that began because
police handcuffed a lawyer who allegedly rifled a woman's purse.
   The lawyers voted by show of hands to keep up their paralyzing
boycott of New Delhi's district courts and India's Supreme Court,
which has been shut since Feb. 15.
   The dispute also closed courts around the country Monday when an
estimated 500,000 lawyers struck in sympathy for their New Delhi
colleagues. That strike also continues.
   The object of their ire is Kiran Bedi, a deputy police
commissioner who has a reputation for stepping on toes. She made
headlines last year by arresting a member of Parliament for
violating curfew laws.
   ``The continuance of Ms. Kiran Bedi in her official position is
detrimental to the interests of justice,'' the lawyers said in a
petition to the government.
   ``She has struck a blow at the independence of the judiciary,
which we will not allow, '' protest leader Gobinda Mukhoty told the
lawyers' demonstration.
   Home Minister Buta Singh on Wednesday rejected demands to
suspend Ms. Bedi, 38.
   The controversy began Jan. 4 when students at a college caught a
man who allegedly rifled a female student's purse.
   He was handed over to police and taken in handcuffs to district
court, where he identified himself as Rajesh Agnihotri, a New Delhi
lawyer.
   Angry district court lawyers went on strike the following day to
protest the handcuffing of a colleague and demanded the suspension
of the police officers involved.
   On Jan. 21, striking lawyers picketed the office of Ms. Bedi,
who has jurisdiction over the Agnihotri district, where the arrest
took place.
   Police charged the corridors with bamboo clubs to disperse the
barristers, injuring 13 lawyers. The following day, the High Court
Bar Association joined the strike, and the Supreme Court lawyers
followed suit on Feb. 15.
   The lawyers say that Ms. Bedi was responsible for ordering
police to charge them with clubs. But they underestimated her
public support. More than 1,000 people demonstrated in her favor on
Feb. 17.
   Ms. Bedi was the first female member of the Indian Police
Service, the training ground for senior officers.
   In the past, she has booked several senior officials and
politicians for traffic violations in the Indian capital, where
such minor indiscretions by the powerful are routinely ignored.
   Ms. Bedi has been uncharacteristically silent on the lawyers'
strike and her office has refused to comment. She met with lawyers
on the eve of the national strike in an unsuccessful pitch to call
it off.
   Lawyer Ram Jethmalani said the issue goes beyond the recent
handcuffing incident.
   ``We are against this officer because she represents an evil
principle, the arrogance of the executive,'' he said.
   Jethmalani, considered one of India's best criminal lawyer, said
the strike would cause difficulties to litigants.
   ``I want the people to suffer a little inconvenience. This show
of solidarity will help us serve the people better,'' He said.
   But New Delhi's largest daily newspaper, The Hindustan Times,
rendered a different verdict.
   ``The lawyers must plead guilty to the charge of having ignored
their obligation to the clients and the society at large,'' it said.

<HEAD>Thatcher Rebukes Ireland over Shooting Inquiry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Margaret Thatcher rebuked Ireland on Tuesday for
conducting its own investigation of the death of a man killed by a
gunshot from a British army observation post just inside Northern
Ireland.
   The prime minister said she did ``not think it right or
possible'' under the 1985 Anglo-Irish agreement for the Irish
Republic to investigate the shooting Sunday of Aidan McAnespie, 23,
in the British province.
   During the House of Commons question-and-answer period, she
declared: ``The Irish government can inquire into anything they
wish, but not of course into matters north of the border.'' The
Anglo-Irish accord gives Ireland an advisory role in the Northern
Ireland affairs in an effort to redress grievances of Roman
Catholics in the Protestant-dominated province.
   Mrs. Thatcher's remarks appeared likely to worsen relations,
already strained by disputes that include Britain's refusal to
prosecute police officers involved in the shooting deaths of six
unarmed Catholics in 1982.
   The British army also disclosed Tuesday that a soldier given
life in prison for the shooting death of a Catholic in Belfast had
been freed and returned to his regiment after serving three years.
   Reports that Pvt. Ian Richard Thain was back in uniform,
although not in Northern Ireland, provoked sharp responses from
leaders of the province's Catholic minority.
   Thain was convicted of fatally shooting Thomas Reilly, road
manager of the pop group Bananarama, on Aug. 9, 1983. He claimed in
court that he fired because riots were going on and he believed
Reilly was about to pull a gun.
   The judge found him ``deliberately untruthful.'' Thain was the
first soldier sentenced to life in prison for actions in Northern
Ireland.
   An army statement said Thain was 18 at the time and, ``while the
army in no way condones his action, we consider the incident to
have been a tragic error of judgment made by a young man in very
difficult circumstances.''
   The Home Office said Thain was released on a life license, a
form of parole under which he can be returned to prison ``should
his behavior give rise to concern.''
   A security cordon ringed the town of Aughnacloy for McAnespie's
funeral Tuesday. He was buried across the border in the Irish
Republic.
   The Irish government sent Eugene Crowley, deputy police
commissioner, to the border town of Monaghan to investigation
McAnespie's death. Protestant politicans called the Irish inquiry
unwarranted interference by a foreign government in Northern
Ireland's affairs.
   McAnespie supported Sinn Fein, the legal political wing of the
outlawed Irish Republican Army. He was killed by a bullet from a
British army observation tower at a checkpoint near Aughnacloy in
County Tyrone, half a mile from the border.
   Relatives said he was walking to a weekly Gaelic football game
and had passed through the checkpoint.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said the
soldier told interrogators the shooting was an accident. He was in
military custody Tuesday.

   The government on Wednesday
banned political activity by 18 opposition groups, including the
nation's largest anti-apartheid organization and its biggest union
federation, in the most sweeping crackdown in a decade.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said the move would be seen by
many government opponents as a ``declaration of war.''
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, however, said the
regulations ``will contribute to a climate of stability, peaceful
coexistence, and good neighborliness among all population groups.''
   Vlok's order prohibits the United Democratic Front, which
represents more than 2 million members, from any activity except
bookkeeping and court action. The same order was applied to 16
other groups, covering most of the large militant black political
groups in South Africa.
   It gives Vlok the power to prohibit any organization ``from
carrying on or performing any activites or acts whatsover.''
   Security police notified at least nine UDF members of
restrictions on their activities, which included being confined to
home and prohibited from speaking publicly.
   UDF co-president Archie Gumede was prohibited from participating
in any UDF activities and banned from speaking to journalists.
   Albertina Sisulu, the other co-president, was ordered confined
to her home from 6 p.m. to 5 a.m., prohibited from participating in
activities of the UDF and other organizations, and barred from
addressing meetings of more than 10 people.
   ``We are all peaceful organizations trying to unite the people.
... Is this the way of reform? ... We dare say the government is
declaring war on the people of South Africa,'' Mrs. Sisulu told
reporters. She said she wasn't sure if she was prohibited from
speaking to the press.
   The 750,000-member Congress of South African Trade Unions was
ordered to stick to labor issues and barred from political
activities, such as advocating holidays with special meaning to
blacks and calling for the release of detained union members.
   Anti-apartheid activists had anticipated a crackdown this year,
suggesting that President P.W. Botha's National Party government
would seek to blunt criticism from the extreme right in advance of
parliamentary by-elections next week.
   The union and several of the affected organizations said they
would consider legal action to challenge the regulations.
   ``The government's idea of reform is to smash all effective
possible political opposition in the country, no matter how
peaceful and lawful, and to rule with a jackboot,'' said Tutu, who
won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his fight against South
Africa's system of racial segregation.
   Tutu appealed to the United States and other Western countries
to intensify economic pressure on South Africa, saying that if they
do not act, ``then God help us.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
the government was ``appalled'' at the restrictive measures.
   ``This is a giant step backward for South Africa,'' Redman told
reporters.
   Jay Naidoo, general-secretary of the trade union federation,
said, ``The closing of the avenues of democratic expression will
possibly lead to an escalation of civil conflict and violence.
There cannot be a peaceful resolution of South Africa's crisis
without freedom of expression and association, and without credible
organizations which can articulate the needs and interests of the
majority.'
   Vlok said the groups being acted against had encouraged civil
disobedience and rebellion, advocated alternative structures to
replace official ones, and waged campaigns of intimidation.
   All the groups denied wrongdoing.
   In addition to the UDF, groups affected by the ban include:
   _ The Azanian People's Organization, the largest group espousing
the black consciousness philosophy pioneered by Steve Biko, the
activist who died in police custody in 1977.
   _ The National Education Crisis Committee, which has promoted a
``People's Education'' philosphy in which black communities would
exercise greater control over their schools.
   _ The Detainees Parents Support Committee, which monitors
detentions and provides support for relatives of people detained
without charge.
   _ The Soweto Civic Association, the main anti-apartheid
community group in the country's largest black township and a key
factor behind the rent boycott that has persisted there for nearly
two years.
   Others included regional and national youth and community
organizations and the Release Mandela Committee, a group
campaigning for the release from prison of African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
   The outlawed ANC is the main group fighting to oust South
Africa's white-led government. Under the government's system of
apartheid, the nation's 26 million blacks have no voice in national
affairs, and the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate schools and districts.

<HEAD>Bulgaria, Turkey Sign Protocol On Good Neighborly Relations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bulgaria and Turkey signed a
protocol on good neighborly relations Tuesday in an apparent effort
to resolve their bitter dispute over Bulgaria's estimated 1 million
ethnic Turks.
   The text of the protocol, as released by the Yugoslav state news
agency Tanjug, was a clear indication that the two feuding
neighbors are determined to normalize relations after years of
discord.
   The signing averted a clash between the two countries at the
Balkan foreign ministers' meeting opening here Wednesday.
   Earlier, sources said the Turkish delegation was planning to
raise the issue of the ethnic Turks, who were forced by Bulgarian
authorities to adopt Bulgarian names. The sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The ``Bulgarization campaign'' began in 1984 and reportedly led
to violent clashes between the Turkish population and Bulgarian
police. It was first reported by Turkish newspapers and was later
confirmed by Western diplomats and Amnesty International.
   Foreign ministers Peter Mladenov of Bulgaria and Mesut Yilmaz of
Turkey signed the protocol at a meeting in a Belgrade hotel, said
Tanjug.
   Mladenov and Yilmaz arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday for the first
meeting of foreign ministers from six Balkan countries. The other
participants come from Albania, Greece, Romania and Yugoslavia.
   Neither the protocol nor the two ministers in news statements
mentioned Bulgaria's Turkish minority, whose existence has so far
not been acknowledged by Bulgarian officials in public.
   ``The protocol we have just signed does not solve the problems,
but I am convinced that it will serve as a sound basis for seeking
positive solutions to the existing problems,'' Mladenov was quoted
as saying.
   Tanjug quoted Yilmaz as saying the protocol ``makes it possible
for us to develop and settle a number of issues of our bilateral
relations.''
   The protocol, as reported by Tanjug, provides for a joint
working group ``with a view to finding a solution to the existing
problems in bilateral relations, the area of humanitarian
cooperation included.''
   It said, ``Another high-level working group shall be established
to determine specific measures to speed up cooperation ... in the
field of economics, trade, tourism, technology, transport,
communications and culture.''
   Under the protocol, the two countries' foreign ministers are to
make periodic visits to the other country and ``review the
activities'' of the two working groups with regular political
consultations between the two foreign ministries.
   A similar protocol between the two countries was signed in 1975.

<HEAD>Reports Spain-ETA Talks May Open Door to Cease-fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spanish officials and leaders of the Basque
separatist organization ETA established preliminary contacts in
Algeria Tuesday that could lead to a cease-fire, Spain's national
EFE news agency reported.
   It said the resumption of talks between the government and ETA
leaders living in exile in Algeria might bring an end to 20 years
of violence that has convulsed the three Basque provinces in
northern Spain and spilled over into the rest of the country.
   Last Friday, government spokesman Javier Solana told reporters
Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez was willing to resume the
talks, broken off after a Dec. 11 car bombing at a Civil Guard
barracks in Zaragoza that killed 11 people.
   He said the ETA appeared to be respecting a 60-day truce it
offered Jan. 28 in return for a resumption of the talks.
   EFE, citing unnamed Algerian sources, said chief negotiators at
the talks in Algeria were Eugenio Etxebeste, an ETA leader, and
Julen Elgorriaga representing the government.
   The government made no comment on the EFE report. Solana said
last week the news media ``should not expect daily updates'' on the
progress of any future talks.
   ETA is an acronym in the Basque language that stands for
Homeland and Liberty.
   Since taking up arms in 1968, the group has claimed
responsibility for killing more than 600 people in its campaign for
independence for the Basque area. Most of the victims were police
and military officers.
   Gonzalez acknowledged in August that his government had made
contacts with ETA leaders in Algeria in an attempt to secure a
cease-fire as a basis for future talks.
   The government has said it is prepared to discuss when, where
and how ETA guerrillas will lay down their arms and possible
pardons for jailed ETA members not directly involved in attacks.
   According to various reports, ETA still seeks greater political
autonomy for the Basque region that would include predominantly
Basque parts of neighboring Navarre province.
   The El Pais newspaper said Gonzalez was expected to discuss the
contacts with ETA in his annual state-of-the-nation address to
Parliament Wednesday.
   But it reported government sources said Gonzalez probably would
warn there could be breakdowns during arduous negotiations and no
guarantee of success.

   Police stormed a Social Welfare Department

who had been held nine hours by a man with a cleaver.
   One policeman was slightly injured but the eight hostages were

hospitalized with head injuries.
   Reports from the scene said Shum was homeless and had applied to
the office for public assistance. He went there Tuesday afternoon
armed with a cleaver and two knives and demanded to see the person
handling his application, police reported.
   When he was told the person was not in, Shum argued with the
staff, who called the police. He locked himself and the employees
inside the office until police broke the door down.
   Robert Yiu, a police spokesman, said officers made their assault
at about 1:45 a.m.

   Sen. Bob Dole, the GOP winner of the South
Dakota primary and Minnesota caucuses, now has 60 delegates to the
Republican National Convention, one fewer than Vice President
George Bush.
   The Kansas senator got all 18 of the national convention
delegates from South Dakota by winning 55 percent of the vote. Dole
was the only candidate to win more than 20 percent of the vote, the
minimum necessary under state GOP rules to win any delegates.
   Former television evangelist Pat Robertson came close, but with
99 percent of the precincts reporting, he finished at 19.6 percent,
just shy of the threshold.
   The Democratic primary in South Dakota, which Missouri Rep.
Richard Gephardt won with 44 percent of the vote, was non-binding.
   Party leaders in the state say they feel an obligation to honor
the voters' wishes. Nevertheless, the results must first be
ratified by a statewide caucus on March 12 to have any effect on
how South Dakota's 15 pledged delegates to the Democratic National
Convention will be awarded.
   If the caucus accepts the results of the primary, Gephardt would
gain nine delegates, and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis would
win six. None of the other Democratic candidates on the ballot
received at least 15 percent of the vote, the minimum needed under
party rules to claim any delegates.
   Following Bush and Dole on the Republican list so far is Rep.
Jack Kemp of New York with 35 delegates and Robertson with eight.
Ten are uncommitted. Those totals include delegates allocated in
Michigan, Kansas, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Guam and South
Dakota.
   In all, 2,277 delegates will attend the GOP National Convention
in New Orleans next August, and 1,139 are needed to win the
nomination.
   In Minnesota, Dole won a straw poll taken in the Republican
caucuses, but that has no binding effect on how the state's 31 GOP
National Convention delegates will be allocated among the
candidates. That will not be decided until Minnesota Republicans
pick 24 national convention delegates at congressional district
conventions in mid-April and choose the remaining 7 delegates at
the state convention in mid-June.
   Minnesota Democrats will have to sort their way through a
mountain of paper ballots that will come in from Tuesday's precinct
caucuses before the allocation of their national convention
delegates can be calculated.
   The figures from the Tuesday night caucuses represented an
informal poll of the presidential preferences of the delegates
elected to attend the county conventions. That poll had no binding
effect, and the county convention delegates will be expected to
follow the results tallied from the separate paper ballots.
   State party leaders do not plan to count those ballots before
March 8, under an agreement worked out with the national party,
which had objected to Minnesota Democrats holding their caucuses so
early in the season.
   Democratic national delegate totals remain unchanged by
Tuesday's events.
   Dukakis has 44.5, Gephardt has 39, Simon has 33, Gore has 10.55,
Jackson has 9.8, and 278.4 are uncommitted. Those totals include
delegates allocated in Iowa and New Hampshire, as well as the
results of an Associated Press survey of party leaders who
automatically will hold seats as convention delegates.
   In all, the Democratic National Convention next July in Atlanta
will include 4,162 delegates, and 2,082 are needed to win the
nomination.

   About 80,000 people joined hands
to form a 42-mile link through the industrial Ruhr Valley Tuesday
to protest the loss of jobs in the steel industry, union organizers
said.
   After spending hours forming their line, the demonstrators
joined hands for about 15 minutes, according to the IG Metall labor
union.
   Thousands of people held flares and banners calling for aid to
unemployed steelworkers, while church bells pealed throughout the
area.
   Police said they could not confirm that the human chain ran
unbroken for 42 miles and they did not provide a crowd estimate.
   Traffic was disrupted on main roads during much of the evening.
   The demonstrators formed their line from the Krupp steel works
in Duisburg-Rheinhausen in the western Ruhr region to the
Hoesch-Westfalen steel works in Dortmund.
   Tens of thousands of steel workers are scheduled to be laid off,
retrained or retired early because of the expected closure of steel
plants.

<HEAD>TV Report Says Afghan Diplomat Defects To West</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Italian newspaper said Tuesday that the chief of
Afghanistan's diplomatic mission in Italy, reported missing since
last week, defected to the West with American help.
   The Foreign Ministry confirmed that the Afghan Embassy reported
last Thursday that Charge d'Affaires Mohamed Nazir Fedaiy, 43, had
``disappeared.''
   But a ministry spokesman declined comment on the front-page
report in the Turin newspaper La Stampa that the diplomat defected
with his wife and was flown to another European country with the
help of U.S. intelligence agents.
   The state-run RAI-TV, without giving attribution, said the envoy
was probably being held under the protection of American agents,
possibly in the United States.
   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Embassy said she had no comment on
the case.
   The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   La Stampa said Fedaiy had sought to defect for some time and a
few weeks ago met with a representative of the former king of
Afghanistan and offered him information on his country.
   Former King Mohammad Zaher Shah, deposed 14 years ago while
vacationing in Italy, has been mentioned as possibly playing a role
in a peace settlement in Afghanistan. He lives in exile in Rome.
   Italian-Afghan relations are at the charge d'affaires level.
Italy recalled its ambassador from Kabul after Soviet troops
entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to support the communist
government in its battle with Islamic rebels.

<HEAD>Coroner Classifies Death of Woman Whose Head Was Removed as
Homicide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Injected sedatives hastened the death
of an 83-year-old woman whose severed head was frozen in hopes she
could someday be restored to life with a new body, officials said
Wednesday in classifying the case as a homicide.
   The Riverside County coroner's office, after reviewing the
results of extensive toxological tests on the tissues of Dora
Kent's headless body, said she was given a lethal dose of a
barbiturate shortly before her death in early December.
   ``The coroner has classified the death as the result of a
homicide due to the administration of medicinal drugs which
assisted Kent's death,'' Supervising Deputy Coroner Dan Cupido said
Wednesday.
   Those involved in the attempt to preserve Mrs. Kent's head for
eventual resurrection denied the coroner's office charge, saying
the drug was administered after she died as part of their effort to
preserve the brain.
   The coroner's office amended its death certificate Tuesday,
referring the case to the Riverside County District Attorney's
Office, where it is now under investigation. The original death
certificate did not state a cause of death pending further tests.
   Deputy District Attorney Curt Hinman said the tests indicated
Mrs. Kent was alive when the drugs were administered. The sedatives
pentobarbital and secobarbital were found throughout the woman's
system, including her liver, kidneys and bone marrow, and
investigators concluded her body had metabolized the drugs, he said.
   ``We think they gave it (the drug) to her before she was dead,''
Hinman said.
   But Mrs. Kent's son, Saul, 48, said Wednesday the allegations of
homicide were ``smear tactics'' to discredit the Alcor Life
Extension Foundation, a cryonics lab here.
   Kent is a strong supporter of the cryonics movement, which
believes bodies or heads may be stored at subfreezing temperatures
and then brought back to life through future advances in science.
   Mrs. Kent had been living in a Riverside nursing home, but on
Dec. 9, her physician, Dr. Steve Harris, determined that she was
gravely ill. Based on that information, Kent moved her from the
home to Alcor.
   Kent said his mother was maintained there briefly on a
respirator before dying Dec. 11. Her head was surgically removed
soon afterward.
   Alcor spokesman Carlos Mondragon said the drug Nembutol was
given to Mrs. Kent after the death. Her son explained barbiturates
are given immediately after death to slow damage to the brain from
lack of oxygen. And another Alcor official, Michael Darwin, said
cardiopulmonary resuscitation was also given after death to
distribute the drugs throughout her system.
   Kent said the foundation had previously explained those methods
and the use of drugs in its notes regarding his mother's
preservation.
   ``Now suddenly to come up and say that they think it's homicide
is kind of absurd,'' he said. ``I was there and she died of natural
causes and then the procedure was started.''
   But Cupido said the drugs ``expedited Dora Kent's death.''
   The death certificate amendment states Mrs. Kent died between
Dec. 9 and Dec. 11, Cupido said.
   Mrs. Kent's death has been under investigation since the
coroner's office learned of it. She died at Alcor's lab in
Riverside, where a body and six other heads are frozen in liquid
nitrogen.
   No doctor was present when she died, which prompted the
coroner's office to investigate her death. The location of her head
has been kept secret by her son and Alcor officials, despite a
coroner's request to examine it.
   A judge earlier this month blocked the coroner from disturbing
any of the frozen remains at Alcor.

   The Kremlin on Wednesday installed an Armenian as
the Communist Party chief of a disputed territory in an apparent
effort to end ethnic protests in Soviet Armenia that a dissident
said involved 200,000 people.
   Soviet authorities also ordered an end to the unrest.
   Protesters in Yerevan, the Armenian capital, want the
Nagorno-Karabakh region in neighboring Azerbaidzhan turned over to
Armenia, smallest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics.
   In another apparent concession, Moscow radio said Armenian party
leaders would ask the Central Committee in Moscow to discuss
Nagorno-Karabakh in a meeting on nationality policy. No such
meeting has been scheduled, but Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
proposed one last week.
   Yerevan was the scene Tuesday and Wednesday of industrial
strikes, school boycotts and public demonstrations said to be the
largest in the Soviet Union's 70-year history.
   In the Baltic republic of Estonia on Wednesday, there was a
rally on an national anniversary day, with demonstrators shouting
``Get the Russians out!'' according to a dissident.
   The demonstrations were the latest in a recent burst of ethnic
conflicts in a huge nation that stretches from Europe through Asia
and encompasses more than 100 nationalities, under a central
government dominated by ethnic Russians.
   Paruyr Ayrikyan, an Armenian activist who spent 17 years in
labor camps and internal exile for national activities, said
200,000 people gathered in the central square of Yerevan.
   He said in a telephone interview that they chanted ``We want a
session!'' _ demanding that a special session of the republic's
legislature decide whether Nagorno-Karabakh should become Armenian.
   Western reporters could not travel to Yerevan immediately, and
telephone contact was not always possible.
   About 150,000 people, most of them Armenians, live in
Nagorno-Karabakh, the disputed autonomous region in the Caucasus
Mountains whose 1,760 square miles make it smaller than Delaware.
Annexation would increase Armenia's area by 14 percent and its
population, about 3.4 million, by 4 percent.
   Last fall, Armenian sources said more than 2,000 ethnic
Armenians marched in the region, just north of Turkey, to protest
mistreatment by Azeris, the dominant ethnic group in Azerbaidzhan.
   The party Central Committee has declared Nagorno-Karabakh should
remain part of Azerbaidzhan, which caused Armenian protests and
began an argument about whether the party has the right to decide
such issues.
   In a dispatch Wednesday night, the official news agency Tass
said the regional party organization named a 56-year-old Armenian,
Genrikh Pogosyan, party leader in Nagorno-Karabakh.
   While Tass said Pogosyan was Armenian and born in
Nagorno-Karabakh, it did not give the nationality of his
predecessor. The surname of the former leader, Boris Kevorkov,
indicates he is Russian or Azeri.
   The agency also referred to a ``passive, wait-and-see attitude
of the autonomous region's party and government bodies whose
leadership had displayed a superficial approach to evaluating the .
.. situation and the existing sentiments.
   Tass said party leaders plan to take all necessary steps to
restore order in Yerevan, effectively declaring an end to the
dispute.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov confirmed there
were mass demonstrations in Yerevan. He described them as peaceful
and said he did not know the number of protesters.
   Arikyan, the Armenian activist, said protesters were angered by
Central Committee interference in a territorial question, which he
said the Soviet constitution defines as a matter for the
government, not the party.
   In a telephone interview from Yerevan, he said major industries
were crippled by strikes Wednesday and virtually all students at
colleges and technical institutes boycotted classes.
   Ethnic tensions have arisen with increasing frequency over the
past year as Soviets embrace Gorbachev's call for ``glasnost,'' or
more openness about some social problems.
   Another national demonstration was reported in Tallinn, the
capital of Estonia. Wednesday was the 70th anniversary of the
establishment of an independent Estonia, which was annexed by the
Soviet Union in 1940.
   Alexander Podrabinek, a Moscow-based dissident, said 2,500-3,000
people gathered at a Tallinn landmark and shouted ``Independence to
Estonia!'' and ``Get the Russians out!''
   Plainclothes agents photographed the demonstrators and militia
surrounded them, bringing in a bus with a loudspeaker that blared
music and propaganda to drown out the demonstrators. No one was
detained and the demonstrators dispersed after about three hours,
he said.
   Podrabinek said he received his information from a correspondent
in Tallinn for the underground journal Express Chronicle, which
Podrabinek edits.
   Earlier, Tass reported there was an official rally in Tallinn to
protest what they considered U.S. provocation of nationalist
activists.
   Street demonstrations occurred last summer in Estonia and its
neighbors Latvia and Lithuania, which were annexed at the same time.
   In the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, at least 3,000
people rioted Dec. 17-18, 1986, in the capital, Alma Ata, to
protest appointment of an ethnic Rusian to replace a Kazakh as the
republic's party leader.
   In a Tass report Tuesday, the government acknowledged the unrest
in Armenia and said it was not in the public interest.
   Gerasimov said the government believes ``things should remain as
they are now'' in terms of which republic governs Nagorno-Karabakh.
He said he had spoken with officials in Armenia by telephone, but
had no more information than that contained in media reports.
   Izvestia, the government newspaper, recommended more public
discussion of the dispute. It acknowledged a ``mass meeting'' of
protesters in Yerevan, student boycotts and involvement of national
party figures in seeking a solution.
   Wednesday's edition of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda
carried the Tass report, but no commentary on the events.
   Ayrikyan, who said he spoke from an apartment 100 yards from the
protest site, said Wednesday: ``There are at least 200,000 people
in front of the Opera House. I've never seen anything like it.
   He said two members of the Central Committee secretariat,
Vladimir I. Dolgikh and Anatoly I. Lukyanov, arrived in Yerevan on
Tuesday ``to calm the people'' in the city 1,100 miles south of
Moscow.
   Dolgikh addressed the protesters Tuesday, the Armenian activist
said.
   On Wednesday, Lukyanov and Dolgikh asked the demonstrators to
send a small delegation to party headquarters in Yerevan to discuss
the dispute, Ayrikyan said.

<HEAD>Gephardt Nails Democratic Foes; Dole Heads South With Two Wins</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS day of week in lead</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Richard Gephardt echoed a George Wallace refrain on
Wednesday, saying there is ``hardly a dime's worth of difference''
between his chief Democratic presidential rivals on economic
issues. Republican Sen. Bob Dole sought to slice into Vice
President George Bush's Southern support.
   Gephardt blistered Gov. Michael Dukakis and Sen. Albert Gore
Jr., while a fourth Democrat announced he would not compete in the
delegate-rich round of primaries known as Super Tuesday on March 8.
Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, reeling after a spate of poor finishes,
insisted he would remain in the race but conceded he lacked the
money to compete across the South.
   Among the Republicans, former television evangelist Pat
Robertson said his Christian Broadcasting Network once knew the
whereabouts of the American hostages in Lebanon and suggested they
could have been rescued.
   The assertion drew a tart response from the White House, where
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``Why didn't he tell us where they
were?''
   It was the second startling comment in as many days from
Robertson. He suggested on Tuesday that Bush's campaign aides were
behind the recent public disclosure of television evangelist Jimmy
Swaggert's sexual misconduct, and said they timed the disclosure to
make life difficult for another television evangelist running for
president.
   Bush denied that charge anew, saying, ``I'd like to see an
apology or proof.''
   The vice president shrugged off Dole's solid victories Tuesday
night in the South Dakota primary and Minnesota caucuses, saying,
``You can't win them all.'' He made a flying tour through New
England, where he hopes to win the Maine caucuses over the weekend
and the Vermont primary next Tuesday.
   But those events _ one in a state where the vice president owns
a home and the other that has no bearing on the hunt for convention
delegates _ drew little attention from the rest of the field.
   Instead, other eyes turned to Dixie, which is hosting most of
the 20 Democratic and 17 Republican contests that will be held on a
single day on March 8.
   Dole campaigned in South Carolina with Sen. Strom Thurmond at
his side, and said he supports legislation on textile imports that
is popular in the state.
   ``I recognize that I've got to catch up,'' he said. ``But we
believe there is some momentum'' after his twin wins in South
Dakota and Minnesota.
   Even so, a fresh poll showed just how far Dole has to go.
   The Denver Post survey of Southern voters showed Bush favored by
54 percent of Republicans most likely to vote on March 8, with Dole
favored by 33 percent. And the Dole forces said their prospects
were particularly bleak in Texas, which offers the biggest single
cache of Super Tuesday delegates.
   Dukakis was a narrower favorite in the Democratic survey, at 26
percent, with Gore at 18 percent, Jesse Jackson at 16 percent, and
Gephardt at 12 percent. The poll was conducted Feb. 19-21 among 759
registered voters in 13 Southern states.
   But if Gephardt's speech in Waco, Texas, was any indication, the
fight for the region's hundreds of delegates will be intense.
   He said Gore and Dukakis seem committed to ``nothing more than
redecorating the facade of the status quo.'' He charged that the
approach both men have taken to the federal deficit problem
``invites a post-election round of income tax increases and federal
cuts in Medicare and Social Security.''
   ``On the central economic issues of this campaign, there is
hardly a dime's worth of difference between Gov. Dukakis and Sen.
Gore,'' said Gephardt.
   He also ridiculed Dukakis's foreign policy experience, saying it
consists ``almost entirely of negotiating with the governor of New
Hampshire over the issue of nuclear power.''
   The ``dime's worth of difference'' phrase was a reminder of
former Alabama Gov. Wallace's third party campaign theme of 1968,
when he used it to sneer at the major party nominees.
   Dukakis' initial response was made by campaign aide Leslie Dach.
   ``We welcome a comparison of the candidates' records but first
we need to know which of Dick Gephardt's records he's talking
about,'' he said.
   ``Mike Dukakis is the only candidate in this race who's balanced
budgets, put people back to work and lowered taxes five times in
five years.''
   There was no immediate response from Gore, who ridiculed Dukakis
and Gephardt as ``two peas in a pod... I don't see either one of
them to stand out as a principal challenger.'' Gore has based his
candidacy on making a strong showing in his native South.
   Simon announced his scaled-back campaign at a news conference in
Washington, saying, ``There's no sense in fooling myself'' about
his chances for success in the South.
   Simon said he would concentrate on the primary in his home state
of Illinois on March 15 and the states that follow. But without
prospects for delegates from the Super Tuesday states, his chance
of winning the nomination appeared non-existent.
   Republican also-ran Jack Kemp vowed he would stay the course,
despite two more disappointing finishes in Minnesota and South
Dakota.
   Kemp's campaign has been victimized by Robertson's emergence as
a strong contender in the early caucus states. ``I needed to break
up the idea that this is a Bush-Dole race,'' he said. ``This is no
longer a Bush-Dole race.''

   The world's largest black religious
organization will begin construction in March on its world center
headquarters, church officials announced Wednesday.
   The $9.2 million development for the National Baptist Convention
U.S.A. Inc. is expected to be completed in April 1989, said T.J.
Jemison, president of the organization.
   More than 40,000 convention members are expected to attend
dedication ceremonies two months later, he said.
   ``With 7.7 million members, the National Baptist Convention has
grown to the point where the leadership decided we need a central
headquarters from which to manage our many missions,'' Jemison said.
   ``The six boards which now comprise the convention are currently
located throughout the country, and to bring them all under one
roof will result in a fundamental restructuring of our entire
organization from which we should reap tremendous benefits,'' he
said.
   The 75,000-square-foot building, containing a 2,000-seat chapel
and crowned by a 225-foot spire, will be built on 12.5 acres near
the seminary of the National Baptist Convention and the Southern
Baptist Convention in downtown Nashville.

   Heavy rain on Wednesday slowed the search
for a kidnapped U.S. Marine and forced a top U.N. official to
postpone a helicopter flight to Beirut to press for his release.
   The rain flooded citrus groves in south Lebanon, where Amal, the
largest Shiite Moslem militia faction, and United Nations
peacekeepers have searched since Lt. Col. William R. Higgins was
abducted Feb.17 near Tyre, 50 miles south of Beirut.
   An Amal spokesman confirmed a report the militia captured gunmen
involved in the kidnapping of Higgins, a onetime aide to former
U.S. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and leader of a U.N.
observers' group in Lebanon.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci, Weinberger's successor,
said Wednesday in Washington that too much was being made of
Higgins' role with the defense secretary's office.
   Carlucci, responding to a question, said: ``Let me point out
that Lt. Col. Higgins was a lower-ranking officer in the office of
the secretary of defense, which has about 38 people in it. My
principal military aide is a major general.''
   ``Lt. Col. Higgins' functions were mainly administrative. I
think overly much is being made of this in the press and if I may
say, I'd prefer to limit by comments to that because I think any
further comment tends to encourage undesirable and unwise press
speculation.''
   The Amal spokesman said the detainees had not been able to
provide information on the whereabouts of Higgins or the
abduction's mastermind, who escaped.
   The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth has
claimed it abducted Higgins and alleged he was a CIA spy. U.S. and
U.N. officials denied the accusation.
   On Monday, the group released a videotaped message in which the
captive recited conditions for his release _ Israeli withdrawal
from south Lebanon, release of Palestinian and Lebanese detainees
held by Israel and suspension of U.S. diplomatic activity in the
Middle East.
   Security sources in Tyre said the Amal search for Higgins, 43,
of Danville, Ky., was continuing.
   ``The weather has generally been against the search campaign,''
said one source, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Heavy rains
and storms hamper the search by Amal.''
   The Amal spokesman said the group arrested in the Tyre region
three gunmen ``who seized Col. Higgins and forced him into the
first getaway car and three men who had monitored Higgins'
movements before the abduction.''
   Amal also captured ``the man who was supposed to transport
Higgins to Beirut,'' he said.
   The seven detainees are among 42 members of the fundamentalist
Hezbollah, or Party of God, arrested by Amal in the past week.
   Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran, has supported Higgins'
abduction, calling him a ``filthy American.'' It claimed Amal has
abducted 150 of its members.
   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella group for smaller
factions involved in the kidnapping of 24 other foreigners missing
in Lebanon. The kidnapped include eight other Americans.
   The longest-held foreign hostage is Terry Anderson, 40, of
Lorain, Ohio. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, was abducted March 16, 1985.
   Hezbollah and Amal have been vying for control of south Lebanon.
   The Amal spokesman said the group was ``coordinating efforts''
with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon. ``We keep UNIFIL
informed on all developments.''
   The Amal spokesman said his militia group, which is headed by
Justice Minister Nabih Berri and backed by Syria, ``supports UNIFIL
and will not permit such acts to reflect negatively on the
peacekeeping force.''
   Higgins headed a 76-man U.N. team of observers that monitored
violations of a 1949 Lebanese-Israeli armistice agreement along the
border. The observers were attached to the U.N. forces when the
nine-nation, 5,800-man force deployed in south Lebanon in 1978
after an Israeli intervention.
   The U.N. commander, Lt. Gen. Gustav Hagglund of Finland, told
reporters Tuesday that further kidnappings of U.N. personnel would
``endanger the future'' of the peacekeeping forces. He said Swedish
soldiers have been ordered ``not to leave their posts or move
around south Lebanon alone.''
   Hagglund met in Naqoura on Wednesday with U.N.
Undersecretary-General Marrack Goulding, a U.N. source said.
Goulding had flown to UNIFIL headquarters by helicopter from
Israel, hoping to fly on to Beirut.
   He later returned to Israel, said the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   UNIFIL's chief spokesman, Timur Goksel, said only that ``Mr.
Goulding's helicopter flight to Beirut has been postponed due to
bad weather conditions.''

<TEXT>
   An acquaintance of Abbas Hamadi
testified Tuesday he could not link the defendant to explosives
that were smuggled into West Germany.
   The Lebanese-born Hamadi is on trial of charges of masterminding
the kidnapping of two West German businessmen in Beirut in January
1987 in a bid to force the release of his brother, Mohammed Hamadi,
held as a TWA hijacker.
   Abbas Hamadi is also charged with smuggling liquid explosives
into West Germany from Lebanon for possible use in terrorist
attacks.
   Rashid Hage, an acquaintance of Abbas Hamadi's, testified that
he and his three sons helped the defendant pick up suitcases from a
train station in the town of Merzig in mid-January 1987. But he
said he did not know what was in the suitcases, nor what Hamadi
later did with them.
   On Jan. 20, Hage's son, Ali, told the court he helped Hamadi
pick up the suitcases and that he suspected the luggage contained
explosives.
   Police found explosives buried in a field near Merzig on Jan.
27, 1987, and said Hamadi had left them there.
   The 47-year-old Hage on Tuesday repeatedly denied any knowledge
of Hamadi's activities.
   In earlier testimony, Hamadi was linked to the Beirut
kidnappings by a West German government official and by transcripts
of wiretapped telephone conversations with his friends and
acquaintainces in West Germany.
   In January 1987, West German businessmen Rudolf Cordes and
Alfred Schmidt were abducted separately in Beirut.
   The abductions followed the Jan. 13, 1987 arrest of Mohammed
Hamadi at the Frankfurt airport.
   Mohammed Hamadi is charged with air piracy and murder in
connection with the June 1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner, in which
39 people were held hostage 17 days and a U.S. Navy diver was
killed.
   Schimidt was released in September, but Cordes remains a
hostage. Another West German, Ralph Rudolf Schray, was kidnapped in
Beirut Jan. 27 and is still being held.

   A disgruntled workers' compensation recipient,
waving a .38 caliber handgun, held two attorneys hostage for nearly
three hours in a Brooklyn office building Wednesday afternoon
before quietly surrendering.
   No one was injured in the incident, which started at the
Workers' Compensation Board around 1:15 p.m., police said. The man
pulled a gun in a hearing room and grabbed the two hostages, said
Detective Joseph McConville, a police spokesman.
   The man was holed up inside the room with his two hostages until
about 3:45 p.m., when he released one of them. Fifteen minutes
later, he turned the second attorney loose and surrendered to
police, said police spokesman Lt. Thomas Fahey.
   Earlier, he had demanded that John Johnson, a local television
news reporter, come to the scene and had aired his grievances about
his case to Johnson. And Workers' Compensation Board Chariman
Barbara Patton agreed to review the case, which involved a 1984 car
accident that led to a settlement in December, authorities said.
   The two lawyers were identified as Richard Kelman and Richard
Wolf. Initially, police had said one of the two lawyers was an
administrative law judge.
   One of the attorneys had represented the gunman in his workers'
compensation case, said Alice McGillion, deputy police commissioner
for public information.
   ``Apparently, his grief is with the workmen's compensation
board,'' McGillion had said during the incident. ``We'll wait it
out.''
   The gunman's only demand was to meet with Johnson, McConville
said. The television newsman arrived shortly before 2:30 p.m.,
riding in a police car with its sirens and lights on and cheered by
workers in the six-story office building.
   The gunman complained to Johnson that he was being harassed over
the $20,000 settlement in his case.

   Thirty-four oil rig workers arrived
safely on land Tuesday after their platform sank into the Gulf of
Mexico, forcing them to flee in watertight capsules.
   The workers on the rig E-302, owned by Keyes Offshore Inc. of
Sugar Land, were evacuated Monday night from the rig, 82 miles
south of Galveston, then transferred to a workboat for the trip
back to Galveston, said Bill Keyes, president of Keyes Offshore.
   The vessel radioed the U.S. Coast Guard about 1:15 a.m. that it
had picked up the workers, said Coast Guard duty officer Don Merwin.
   About three hours earlier, a distress call had been relayed to
the Coast Guard from the rig, Merwin said. Coast Guard rescue ships
were dispatched from Houston, Corpus Christi and Sabine.
   The accident occurred when one of the 396-foot legs of the
triangular, jack-up rig punched through the Gulf floor, Keyes said.
   ``It resulted in bending the three legs on the rig,'' he said.
``The rig was about five feet above the water because we had not
jacked up all the way.''
   Workers had been at the site about three hours before the
accident, which happened in seconds, he said.
   Southwesterly winds at 30 knots, causing 7- to 10-foot waves,
may have contributed to the collapse, Merwin said.
   ``That kind of wind, though, shouldn't have been enough to sink
a rig like that,'' Merwin said. The rig was capable of drilling
20,000 feet, he said.
   The Coast Guard Marine Safety office would investigate, he said.
   Company spokesman Bill Flores said the rig appeared to be
salvageable.

<HEAD>Soviet Union Buys 350,000 Tons of Corn</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has bought 350,000 metric
tons of U.S. corn for delivery this year under a long-term
agreement between the two countries, the Agriculture Department
said Wednesday.
   It was the first U.S. corn sale to the Soviet Union since last
fall, although Moscow has been buying huge quantities of wheat at
subsidized prices under the department's Export Enhancement Program
(EEP). Corn is not eligible for the subsidy.
   Jean Nollmeyer of the department's Foreign Agricultural Service
said it was the first substantial sale of corn to the Soviets since
last Oct. 23 when U.S. exporters reported 600,000 tons. Some small
quantities were sold after that, she said.
   No selling prices or other information about the corn sale were
disclosed. When subsidies are involved, the exporting firms,
quantities and amounts of EEP payments are shown, but not when
straight cash deals are involved.
   Under EEP, private exporters are given surplus commodities owned
by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. so they can sell a
foreign buyer wheat or other authorized commodity at competitive
world prices.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 350,000 tons of
corn would be about 13.8 million bushels.
   Corn prices recently have been averaging about $1.82 per bushel
at the farm level, meaning that the sale could have a farm value of
around $25 million.
   The corn is part of the grain the Soviet Union is committed to
buy during the fifth and final year of the agreement, which calls
for the annual purchase of at least 9 million tons of U.S. grain.
The pact expires Sept. 30.
   According to the agreement, the annual purchases are supposed to
include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The
Soviets have the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as
wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two
tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain
equivalent.
   With the latest purchases, the Soviets now have bought a little
more than 2 million tons of corn, or just half of the minimum
amount specified by the agreement.
   By comparison, the Soviet Union has bought more than 6.3 million
tons of wheat at subsidized prices, plus 800,000 tons of soybeans
and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal for delivery this year.

<HEAD>Delvalle May Break with Noriega, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panamanian President Eric Arturo Delvalle has
indicated to associates that he may be ready to break his close
links to military strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega, according to
U.S. officials.
   The officials, in interviews this week, said any such move would
narrow further Noriega's base of support and possibly hasten his
demise as Panama's dominant political force.
   The Reagan administration looks upon Noriega as the principal
obstacle blocking its goal of an eventual transition to elected,
civilian-led rule in Panama.
   The officials, who asked not to be identified, said Delvalle has
privately expressed his intention for many weeks to distance
himself from Noriega, but they recognize that such a step would
require considerable courage.
   ``We get information from all sorts of sources, including
friends and relatives, that he is about to do something along these
lines,'' one official said. Congressional sources, also insisting
on anonymity, said they have heard the same reports.
   Since last summer, the administration has been publicly
encouraging Panama's military officers to withdraw from politics as
a means of promoting a return to rule by civilians. In the
meantime, much of the U.S. aid program to Panama has been suspended
and Panama has expelled all American aid personnel.
   Two federal indictments against Noriega on drug trafficking
charge added a new dimension to the already strained relationship.
The indictments, handed down in Florida earlier this month,
portrayed Noriega as a key member of an international
drug-smuggling conspiracy. In Congress, opposition to Noriega spans
the political spectrum.
   Delvalle assumed the presidency in 1985 under circumstances that
strongly suggested Noriega had forced his predecessor, Nicolas
Ardito Barletta, from office.
   It was a constitutional succession, but Delvalle has been widely
perceived as no more than Panama's titular head.
   Noriega has maintained that executive authority rests with
Delvalle and that Panama has achieved a full transition to
democracy. Noriega says his U.S. critics are campaigning against
him for the purpose of annulling the Panama Canal treaties, under
which the waterway reverts to Panamanian control at the end of 1999.
   Attempts to obtain comment from the Panamanian Embassy on
Delvalle's purported intentions were unsuccessful.
   For the United States, the stakes in Panama are extraordinarily
high. The administration believes that a democratic, politically
stable Panama offers the best assurance for the continued efficient
operation of the canal.
   The U.S. officials noted that challenging Noriega would not be
an easy step for Delvalle. They said the president's extensive
business interests and his family could be threatened if he breaks
with Noriega. In addition, Delvalle's health is said to be tenuous
because of a heart operation.
   However, the officials said Delvalle has become increasingly
disturbed by his ties to Noriega and that some of his friends have
rebuffed him because of that association.
   Delvalle also may be tempted to act because of Panama's growing
financial crisis. ``The country is falling apart all around him,''
said one source.
   Lawrence Chewning Fabrega, a Panamanian diplomat who resigned
recently in protest over Noriega's rule, said in an interview this
week that the country's financial problems are so severe the
government may not be able to meet its payroll next month.

<HEAD>Swaggart Penalty May Be Stiffened After Wave Of Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assemblies of God leaders, swamped with
protests that the penalty recommended for television evangelist
Jimmy Swaggart's moral lapses was too mild, indicated Wednesday it
may be stiffened.
   A torrent of complaining telephone calls has poured into the
denomination's headquarters here, more than 3,000 of them in the
past two days.
   ``There's a strong sense of moral outrage at the leniency
applied in this case,'' said the Rev. Howard Cummings of Aurora,
Colo., who said he got that assessment from two of the
denomination's top executives.
   A special meeting was called for Thursday of the church's
13-member executive presbytery, which rules on such matters, to
examine the Louisiana state presbytery's recommendation that
Swaggart be suspended from preaching for three months and undergo
two years' rehabilitation.
   Swaggart, known for his harsh denunciations of sexual lapses in
his worldwide TV preaching, was charged with such an offense
himself, although details have not been specified.
   Photographs showing Swaggart with a prostitute reportedly were
given to church officials by rival evangelist Marvin Gorman, who
filed a $90 million suit charging Swaggart with unjustly accusing
him of numerous sexual affairs.
   An unidentified New Orleans prostitute said on ABC-TV Tuesday
night that she had had sex with Swaggart, while other reports
described the case as involving ``pornographic'' activity.
   A suburban New Orleans sheriff said Wednesday that a tattooed
prostitute with an arrest record in Louisiana, Florida and
Tennessee is believed to be the woman photographed with Swaggart
last October.
   Jefferson Parish Sheriff Harry Lee told the State-Times that the
28-year-old woman was rumored to be in Florida on Thursday. He said
he has a warrant for her arrest for failure to show up for a Dec. 9
hearing on a soliciting for prostitution charge.
   The likelihood that Swaggart's penalty may be extended came in
official word that the issue was expected to be turned back to the
Louisiana district, which had proposed the penalty, for
reconsideration.
   That is the prescribed procedure under church bylaws for getting
a punishment revised if it is deemed inadequate.
   If the matter is returned to the state district, a final
decision may not come for several weeks, said Juleen Turnage, the
denomination's information officer.
   Church sources also said the Louisiana district, in announcing
its decision Tuesday, had violated a church bylaw that such
recommendations are not to be disclosed until approved by top
officials.
   ``It created tremendous pressures, appearing that the Louisiana
district was trying to dictate its judgment,'' Cummings said.
   It was learned that some members of Swaggart's board are on the
Louisiana district council, and did not abstain from participating
in the case.
   Asked whether the $12 million that Swaggart contributes annually
to the denomination might have been a factor in the Louisiana
handling of case, Ms. Turnage said, ``It won't affect the decision
here.''
   The church's final verdict, when it comes, will be in accord
with ``the seriousness of the offense,'' Ms. Turnage said.
   An unwritten church precedent is that those involved in sexual
offenses are barred from preaching for at least a year. ``It's
never been less than a year,'' she said.
   Ms. Turlage said a ``high percentage'' of those calling the
church about the Louisiana district's proposal ``were not pleased.''
   ``A lot of people are unhappy with the initial recommendation,''
said the Rev. Richard Champion, editor of the denomination's
weekly, Pentecostal Evangel. But he added, ``Many thought it too
light. Some thought it too severe.''
   Cummings, pastor of 2,000-member First Assemblies of God Church
in Aurora and former district presbyter, said protests at the
lightness of the sentence had come from overseas as well as across
the United States.
   ``Pastors and leaders are deeply concerned about the adverse
effects on young people and church efforts to teach them moral
principles,'' he said, as well as on the ``image of the church and
American Christianity'' generally.
   ``Most pastors take their marriages seriously,'' he said, and to
``give approval to this sentence is to say we're soft on sin.''
   He said some overseas leaders have demanded immediate cutting
off of Swaggart's overseas broadcasts.
   The denomination has 2 million members nationally, and about 16
million in autonomous Assemblies churches overseas.
   ``Nobody is out for blood, or after Swaggart's hide,'' Cummings
said. He said most want the case handled not only with compassion
and forgiveness, but ``with a sense of accountability'' for conduct.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Communist official who monitors
religious affairs indirectly attacked Thursday a group of Roman
Catholics who organized a petition to the government signed by more
than 300,000 believers.
   Deputy Culture Minister Frantisek Jelinek said ``so-called
activities we have witnessed in recent days not only do not explain
accurately (church problems), but essentially damage'' their
solution.
   Jelinek oversees church affairs in the Czech republic.
   The 31-point petition, said by knowledgeable religious activists
to have garnered 243,000 signatures in Slovakia and about 100,000
in the Czech lands, demands separation of church and state, more
religious education and permission for priests and bishops to fill
vacant positions in 10 dioceses.
   It gained support from Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek and was signed
by far more people than any other document of its kind in 40 years
of communist rule in Czechoslovakia.
   Authorities were slow to comment on the petition, which has
circulated since late December. An article in the Communist Party
daily Rude Pravo last Saturday, however, attacked some points as
unconstitutional, while admitting that some demands, such as the
one for more bishops, were ``natural.''
   In reporting Jelinek's remarks, the state news agency CTK did
not quote him as mentioning the petition. But the comments appeared
directed at petition organizers, who have been attacked in the
state-run media.
   Jelinek was speaking in the Moravian capital of Brno to leaders
of the government-sponsored Pacem in Terris group, a priests'
organization not recognized by the Vatican.
   In Prague, an official at the state office for church affairs
said talks between the Communist authorities and the Vatican on
filling vacant sees will not resume for at least one month. The two
sides met last month but did not report progress.
   The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The government favors Pacem in Terris candidates to fill the
vacant sees. The Vatican wants other candidates. No new bishops
have been named in Czechoslovakia since 1973.
   No official statistics are kept on the number of believers in
Czechoslovakia, but church sources estimate the Roman Catholics
make up about 60 percent of the 15.5 million population.
   Interest in Roman Catholicism and other religions in
Czechoslovakia has revived in recent years, particularly among
young people.
   In an article Feb. 13, the North Bohemian Communist party daily
Pruboj attributed this to what it described as the low morals of
society and suggested the new believers could not be condemned for
turning to religious faith.
   A public show of the strength of religous belief is expected
March 6 in Prague during a Mass for the Blessed Agnes, a
13th-century Czech princess who became abbess of a Prague convent.
She is to be made a saint later this year.
   Czechoslovakia is a federal socialist republic consisting of two
nations, the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist
Republic.

<HEAD>Carlucci Says Webb Never Complained To Him About Budget Cuts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Navy Secretary James H. Webb never
approached Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci to complain about
proposed Navy budget cuts before Webb quit in anger, Carlucci told
Congress on Wednesday.
   Carlucci said he had heard that Webb was unhappy but said Webb
``never elected to come and talk to me about it.''
   Webb abruptly resigned Monday with a public blast at Carlucci
for rejecting Webb's proposals on the Navy budget, which was
reduced along with budgets for the other services to meet lowered
military spending totals approved by Congress and President Reagan.
   Webb will be replaced by William L. Ball III, a veteran Capitol
Hill lobbyist for the administration.
   Carlucci appeared before the House Armed Services Committee to
defend Reagan's military budget, unveiled last week, and Carlucci's
decisions about how to reduce defense spending by the $33 billion
total approved by Reagan and Congress late last year.
   To meet the lowered spending goals, Carlucci said, he ordered
reductions in ships, helicopters and other hardware and chose to
retain spending for pay raises and training.
   Carlucci pronounced himself committed to the 600-ship Navy, the
fleet size set by Reagan shortly after he took office in 1981 when
the Navy had about 450 ships.
   Carlucci ordered 16 aging frigates mothballed, which will mean
that the Navy will have 580 ships at the end of the current fiscal
year. But Carlucci also pointed out that the Navy would be
authorized to build 17 ships in Reagan's proposed budget.
   ``As most people who've worked with me know, I function with an
open door,'' said Carlucci, a veteran of numerous top government
jobs.
   He said Webb ``never came to me with any protest over the budget
cuts nor was I aware of his intention to resign until the letter
actually landed on my desk (Monday).''
   Carlucci was generally praised Wednesday by legislators who
noted that he had a difficult job, taking office late last year at
about the same time the $33 billion cut was ordered. Because of
that reduction, the proposed Pentagon budget for the next fiscal
year will be $299 billion.
   Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., ranking Republican on the panel,
referred to Webb and noted, ``I don't understand where this fit of
pique comes from...If anybody's living in fat city, it's the Navy
the past few years. We've worked toward a 600-ship Navy, that's
fine, but there's nothing magic about that.''
   He criticized Webb for what Dickinson said was ``ill grace.''
   Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Stafff, also disputed Webb's statements that the Joint Chiefs had
opposed Carlucci's plan to mothball the 16 frigates. Webb said the
ships should have instead been transferred to the reserves, where
they could later be returned to the active fleet.
   Crowe said didn't support putting the ships into the reserve
fleet.
   Both Crowe and Carlucci reiterated their warnings that U.S.
security might be damaged if defense budgets are not increased.
   The budget ``reflects significant force structure reductions _
fewer ships, fewer aircraft, fewer weapons systems _ that have
long-term implications for our national security,'' said Carlucci.
   He added: ``We must weigh carefully our future decisions on
defense budgets and programs if we are not to reverse the
substantial achievements in our military forces realized at great
cost over the last seven years.''

<HEAD>New Female Condom Being Tested in Europe and United States</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new ``condom for females'' pioneered in Europe
will be tested this spring in the United States, and its developers
predicted Wednesday it would be a major weapon in the fight against
AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.
   The new disposable contraceptive, made of polyurethane,
resembles a condom but is worn by women, researchers said Wednesday
as they unveiled the device.
   ``It takes the advantages of both the male condom and the female
diaphragm and gets rid of significant disadvantages,'' said Mary
Ann Leeper, head of the research team developing the device for
Wisconsin Pharmacal Co., which will market it in the United States
and Canada.
   But Dr. Gerald Zatuchni, a gynecologist with 25 years experience
in researching and developing new contraceptives, said he saw the
potential for ``real problems'' with the device.
   ``I have not seen the device nor have there been any published
studies that would indicate its acceptability to couples, the
effectiveness of the device in preventing pregnancy or any
side-effects from using the device,'' Zatuchni said.
   The device, known in Europe as a ``fem-shield'' or vaginal
shield, isn't sold anywhere yet, but testing has begun in Europe
and is scheduled to start in the United States in March, officials
said.
   The contraceptive consists of a soft, loose-fitting polyurethane
sheath and two flexible polyurethane rings, Ms. Leeper said.
   One of the rings lies inside the sheath and serves as an
insertion mechanism and internal anchor, fitting against the
woman's cervix much like a diaphragm, she said. The other ring
forms the outer edge of the sheath and remains outside the vagina.
   ``It is no more difficult to insert than a tampon,'' said Dr.
Paul Salmon, who helped organize tests of the device at London's
Middlesex Hospital.
   The company, based in Jackson, Wis., said the device would
provide more protection than the male condom, in part because the
material is stronger than most condoms and covers a larger physical
area, reducing chances of infection or exposure to body fluids.
   ``From a medical perspective, this product is likely to offer
additional protection against sexually transmitted diseases,''
Salmon said.
   It also is more convenient to use than a diaphragm, Ms. Leeper
said, because it doesn't have to be initially fitted by a doctor
and can be inserted up ``six hours before the sex act or six
minutes before.''
   Zatuchni, a gynecology and obstetrics professor at Northwestern
University Medical School in Chicago, said the idea of a
``one-size-fits-all'' condom for women ``would be sort of
ridiculous because women's anatomy varies so much.''
   ``It would be hard to envision such a device staying on during
the act of intercourse,'' he said.
   Ms. Leeper said secure and proper fitting actually would occur
during intercourse.
   She said the company had no estimate on how much the device
would cost consumers.
   The ``female condom'' was developed by an group of gynecologists
and obstetricians headed by Danish gynecologist Dr. Erik Gregersen
and his wife, Bente.
   The device has been tested so far on 80 couples in the United
Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden, and clinical trials are continuing in
Europe, Ms. Leeper said.
   The World Health Organization also plans to conduct clinical
trials in 15 countries, including Brazil, Thailand, Singapore and
African nations battling the spread of AIDS.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is believed to be spread
mainly through sexual intercourse, shared hypodermic needles and
from infected mothers to their infants at or before birth.
   Researchers won't have statistics on how effective the device is
in preventing pregnancy or the spread of diseases like AIDS until
additional studies are completed, Salmon said.
   The company hopes to apply to the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration sometime this summer for permission to begin
marketing the device commercially in the United States.
   ``If everything goes as planned,'' Ms. Leeper said, ``this
product will be available to the consumer by the end of the year.''

   A House panel voted unanimously Wednesday to
approve legislation requiring additional disclosures for
increasingly popular home equity loans.
   The measure received the full support of the eight-member House
Banking consumer affairs subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Frank
Annunzio, D-Ill., including Rep. Fernand J. St Germain, D-R.I.,
chairman of the House Banking Committee.
   Similar legislation is expected to be introduced in the Senate
in the near future. Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of
the Senate Banking consumer subcommittee, held hearings last year
on the general subject of home equity loans, in which a home owner
borrows money against the equity in his or her home.
   According to U.S. Housing Markets, a research survey published
by Lomas & Nettleton, the Dallas mortgage banking and financial
services firm, the value of new second mortgages and home equity
loans were to increase to more than $150 billion by the end of 1987.
   Home equity loans totaled $30 billion in 1981, according to the
report, but topped $50 billion in 1984. The popularity of such
loans began mushrooming when a new tax law took effect in January
1987 that limited the deductibility of interest on most consumer
loans, but preserved deductions for home loans.
   The House bill, introduced by Annunzio and Rep. David Price,
D-N.C., would, among other things, put limits on a creditor's
ability to terminate a home equity credit line and demand full and
immediate repayment of the balance due.
   The measure also prohibits the creditor from unilaterally
changing the terms of the home equity credit line agreement and
allows states leeway to provide for additional requirements.
   The Consumer Bankers Association, a group representing retail
banks, savings and loans and credit unions, supported the
subcommittee's action.
   Two major consumers organizations, Consumers Union and the U.S.
Public Interest Research Group, applauded Annunzio for moving the
bill out of the subcommittee but criticized the panel ``for failing
to correct major abuses in the HEL (home equity loan) market.''
   The organizations said panel members promised to work toward
changing the bill when it is considered by the full Banking
Committee.
   Michelle Meier, counsel for government affairs with Consumers
Union, said the present bill ``doesn't do enough to protect
consumers. It doesn't prohibit some fundamentally unfair contract
terms. It only makes the lenders tell you about them.''

   Police found 5-week-old Rachael
Ann White on Tuesday, four days after she was kidnapped by a woman
answering a baby-sitter ad. The baby appeared to be in good
condition, police said.
   ``We found found her, and we reunited her with her parents at
11:42 a.m. at the detective bureau,'' said Lt. Joe Vernier. ``There
were many smiles and tears throughout the investigations bureau
here.''
   Acting on a tip through police at the Air Force Academy, police
found Rachel Ann Abbott at a home on the north side of the city,
Vernier said.
   ``When I saw (Rachael Ann) come through the door, nothing could
have made me more happy in my life _ nothing,'' said the child's
mother, Cora Abbott, 27. Officers appaluded as she and the baby
were reunited.
   Abbott had issued a nationwide plea Monday for the safe return
of her baby.
   Police said Maritza Rentz, a psychologist, was arrested for
investigation of kidnapping.
   ``It appears it was a replacement baby,'' said Vernier. The
suspect had a pregnancy that terminated in October, he said. He
didn't say how the pregnancy ended.
   The child was taken from Abbott's home Friday morning by a woman
who had come to the house in response to an ad for a baby sitter.
   The child's grandmother, Evelyn Reed, 52, asked the woman to
hold the child while she answered a telephone in another room. When
the grandmother returned, the child and the woman were gone.
   Rentz's husband, Capt. Paul Rentz, is an instructor in the Air
Force Academy's behavioral sciences department, police said.
   Authorities said that he was being questioned but that it was
not known if he was involved in the abduction.

<HEAD>Jackson Camp Says Minnesota Showing Demonstrates Electability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson's campaign manager on Wednesday
heralded his second-place finish in the Minnesota caucuses as a
``rainbow coalition'' victory and proof that the so-called
electability issue is dying off.
   Jackson got 20 percent of the vote in a state with a voting-age
black population of 1 percent, proof that his appeal went far
beyond the his traditionally strong base among blacks, said Gerald
Austin.
   ``We're thrilled about what happened yesterday,'' he said.
   Observers said there was evidence that Jackson's targeting of
the hard-pressed, blue collar workers may be paying off, although
there were no exit polls to confirm that.
   Austin predicted that as voting occurs in more states, people
will stop talking about whether the fact that Jackson is black
means he can't be elected.
   ``I haven't heard it in a couple of weeks,'' he said of the
electability issue.
   Opinion polls tend to support the notion that Jackson has made
some strides in his effort to reach out out to whites, although
this early in the election season it is not yet clear how much of
that will translate into votes across the country.
   ``Overall, I think he has made a slight inroad into the white
vote. I do not think there's any evidence so far that it has been
substantial,'' said polling associate John Brennan of ABC-TV's
polling operation.
   Pollster Geoffrey Garin of Peter Hart Research Associates said
the firm's polling has consistently found ``that we're looking at
very different Jesse Jackson than in 1984.''
   ``The sense of polarization that was there four years ago really
isn't there this time. There are obviously some white voters who
are not open to Jesse Jackson, but the negatives and the degree of
antagonism ... has really worn out over four years.''
   ``For whites who are either strongly liberal or sort of feel
ignored by the establishment, there is a real sense of sympathy for
the things that Jackson's been saying.''
   Jackson himself makes a particular point of chiding white voters
who think along the lines of ``I like Jackson, I like what he's
saying _ but ...''
   He told a ballroom full of receptive United Auto Workers members
this week that those people ``should move from `but' to
`therefore.'''
   Jackson edged out Sen. Paul Simon for second place after the
Illinois senator had banked heavily on a good showing there.
   Jackson also had targeted the state _ where he got only 2.4
percent of the vote in his 1984 race _ but had spent only four days
campaigning there this time around, and put only about $45,000 into
the state, said Austin. He credited much of the success to
organizing by a devoted crew of volunteers.
   Minnesota political analyst D.J. Leary said Jackson's support
appeared strong among liberal whites and blue collar workers.
Jackson has gone after union worker support across the country,
travelling to many strike locations to back them, including the
Hormel strike in Austin, Minn.
   ``He was doing very well among working people,'' Leary said. He
said he attended a Minneapolis caucus where 44 of the 134
participants supported Jackson, and only one of those 44 was black.
   Austin said Jackson also got strong support from gays in
Minnesota. Jackson had drawn a capacity crowd during a campaign
appearance last week at a Minneapolis church led by a lesbian
pastor.
   In the Super Tuesday primaries on March 8, Jackson expects also
to expand his large base of black supporters into the gay community
and trade union groups, Austin said.
   Nationwide, polls show Jackson has his work cut out for him
among white voters. A CBS-New York Times poll taken last week
showed Jackson was the choice of 3 percent of the white voters, and
13 percent overall.
   In a mid-January poll, he did better, getting 6 percent among
the whites polled, said CBS News Director of Surveys Kathleen
Frankovic.
   However she noted the polls have also shown that he gets ``a
clear measure of respect'' from whites, admiration for his
leadership qualities, and a feeling that he cares strongly about
their problems.
   In Jackson's adoptive home state, a Chicago Tribune poll in
mid-January showed that among 507 Democratic voters, 39 percent
picked him as their first or second presidential choice. The
electorate is 26 percent black.
   Among the whites, 35 said they had a impression of him, and 37
percent reported a negative impression.

   Her mother wanted her to come home to
Massachusetts, but 17-year-old Lenora Rolle wanted to stretch her
vacation in New York by just one day. It turned out to be her last.
   ``I begged and pleaded with her to come home,'' Coralie Rolle
said after learning that her daughter had been shot to death at a
party in Brooklyn. ``I missed her. I wanted her back. I didn't like
her being there too long. I begged her to be careful.''
   It was a lack of care _ or a surfeit of trust _ that led to Miss
Rolle's death Tuesday morning, according to accounts by police.
   Miss Rolle, a senior at Rindge and Latin High School in
Cambridge, had used the money she earned as a cashier at
Warburton's pastry shop in Harvard Square to finance the trip to
New York, where she stayed with aunts in the Bronx.
   Detectives say she was at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in
Manhattan on Monday night with a 15-year-old friend, Bianca, when
the two were lured away from their Boston-bound bus by a peddler of
exotic fragrances.
   The man, who may have known Bianca, urged the girls to come to a
party at his mother's house in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn,
and promised to pay their bus fare home.
   ``She was a good girl, but she liked to party,'' her mother
said. She also said that Lenora was not very streetwise.
   The party was in a two-bedroom apartment on the second floor of
a four-story apartment building. Police Sgt. Arthur Stoecker, who
is investigating the case, said at least seven people were at the
party; one of those in attendance told New York Newsday that there
were about 15. Stoecker said a few empty crack vials were found in
the apartment afterward.
   After Miss Rolle arrived, police and witnesses say, she was
approached by a man who demanded to have sex with her.
   ``Is she for me? Is this one for me?'' the man asked, according
to a witness quoted by the New York Post.
   When Miss Rolle refused, the man pulled out a 9mm hand-held
machine gun and fired two shots into the floor, authorities said.
He then forced her to undress and, as she screamed in protest,
dragged her into a bedroom.
   The other partygoers fled in terror. ``They were fearful for
their own lives,'' Stoecker said.
   He said the witnesses tried to telephone police, but were unable
to get into an apartment building across the street. A street phone
was out of order, they said.
   After about a half-hour, they saw the gunman, still clutching
his pistol, leave the building. When they entered, they found Miss
Rolle dead.
   An autopsy Wednesday determined that she had been shot in the
back, the right thigh and the left arm, according to a spokeswoman
for the city Medical Examiner's office, Ellen Borakove. Fluid
samples were sent to a lab to determine if Miss Rolle had been
raped.
   Stoecker said police were searching Wednesday for Michael Mays,
20, a convicted felon. ``He's a suspect,'' Stoecker said, although
he added that ``there hasn't been an official warrant yet.''
   Mays served about two weeks in Rikers Island in 1986 on a
misdemeanor sexual misconduct conviction, according to a
spokeswoman for the city Correction Department, Ruby Ryles. Last
June he was sentenced to three to nine years in state prison after
pleading guilty to attempted robbery, according to Glenn Goldberg,
a spokesman for the Brooklyn district attorney's office.
   Criminal court records indicate the sentencing was imposed in
absentia. In any case, Mays never served the time. A spokesman for
the state Correctional Services Department, James Flateau, said the
prison system had no record of Mays. Goldberg said the prosecutor's
records end with Mays' sentencing. Ms. Ryles said Mays never served
time in city jail on the attempted robbery charge.

<HEAD>Gephardt Blasts Dukakis And Gore On Economic Issues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WACO, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Richard Gephardt opened fire Wednesday on
Michael Dukakis and Albert Gore, rivals in the race for the
Democratic presidential nomination, saying their vague positions
invite a round of income tax increases and cuts in Medicare and
Social Security after the election.
   Echoing the rhetoric of former Alabama Gov. George Wallace in
past presidential campaigns, Gephardt called Dukakis and Gore the
favorites of ``editorialists and elites'' with ``hardly a dime's
worth of difference'' between them on economic issues.
   With the crucial Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses less than
two weeks away, Gephardt, a Missouri congressman, leveled his
charges at Dukakis, governor of Massachusetts, and Gore, a senator
from Tennessee, who are the two he must beat March 8 to become the
Democratic front-runner. Gephardt generally trails both in the
polls in the Super Tuesday states.
   On foreign policy, Gephardt said Dukakis' experience ``consists
almost entirely of negotiating with the governor of New Hampshire
over the issue of nuclear power.''
   On the economy, Gephardt said Gore ``has talked more about what
is wrong with the Iowa caucus than what is wrong with the national
economy.''
   He accused Gore of having ``no budget solution at all'' and
Dukakis of being off the mark by as much as $95 billion with his
claim of the return on more aggressive pursuit of tax cheats.
   ``On the central economic issues of this campaign, there is
hardly a dime's worth of difference between Governor Dukakis and
Senator Gore,'' Gephardt said in a speech. ``The Gore-Dukakis
approach is to distract the voters from those fundamental questions
_ to divert the campaign to tactics or drown it in generalities.
   ``The Gore-Dukakis approach is worse than an evasion. It invites
a post-election round of income tax increases and federal cuts in
Medicare and Social Security _ which is the standard prescription
of too many editorialists and elites,'' Gephardt said.
   ``I am not their candidate. I have not been a favorite of the
establishment editorialists. Michael Dukakis is. I have not been
endorsed by the neo-liberals of The New Republic. They have
endorsed Albert Gore.''
   On farm policy, trade and the idea of an oil import fee,
Gephardt contended: ``Governor Dukakis talks competence; Senator
Gore talks strength _ but there is nothing competent or strong
(about their policies).''
   Dukakis and Gore were on the road campaigning Wednesday and did
not have an immediate response to Gephardt's blast.
   But Dukakis aide Leslie Dach said: ``We welcome a comparison of
the candidates' records but first we need to know which of Dick
Gephardt's records he's talking about.''
   Dach said that ``Mike Dukakis is the only candidate in this race
who has balanced budgets, put people back to work and lowered taxes
five times in five years.''
   Gore has ridiculed Dukakis and Gephardt as ``two peas in a pod.
... I don't see either one of them to stand out as a principal
challenger.''
   Gephardt has been hitting Dukakis with ads accusing him of
raising taxes in Massachusetts and of making ridiculous suggestions
to farmers that they should diversify with crops such as
blueberries and Belgian endive.
   Gephardt and Dukakis have split early Democratic tests, while
Gore has focused on Super Tuesday when 20 states and American Samoa
hold primaries and caucuses _ many of them in the South.
   Polls across the South generally put Gephardt third or fourth in
the field. Jesse Jackson has usually been the leader in the
Southern surveys, but a new Gallup Poll conducted last week gave
Dukakis the lead.
   Dukakis and Gore have big campaign warchests for March 8, while
Gephardt's campaign has been on a slimmer budget.
   In Austin, Texas, Gephardt, who won Tuesday's South Dakota
primary, said he doesn't think Gore will have much impact on the
March 8 elections.
   ``Albert Gore has not run and won anything in any of these races
(so far),'' Gephardt said. ``He pulled out of Iowa. He ran hard in
New Hampshire and got not many votes. He was very active in South
Dakota, probably spent more than I did and did not get many votes.
I don't see this as a Gephardt-Gore race, I think it's a
Gephardt-Dukakis race.''

<HEAD>Ethics Panel To Hold Off on Biaggi Expulsion Resolution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee has decided to hold
off introducing a resolution calling for the expulsion of 10-term
Rep. Mario Biaggi because he is involved in litigation, according
to a letter released Wednesday.
   The Committee on Standards of Official Conduct will not bring
the matter berfore the House for a vote until ``an appropriate time
can be established with Congressman Biaggi in order to allow for
his particiaption in the floor proceedings,'' the letter said.
   Biaggi, D-N.Y., is appealing his conviction on charges of
accepting illegal paid vacations from an old political friend and
ally. He is also due to be tried on bribery and racketeering
charges in the Wedtech case starting March 7 in U.S. District Court
in New York.
   The ethics committee announced last week it would recommend that
Biaggi be expelled for violating the House code of conduct by
accepting the vacations and not reporting them on his financial
disclosure forms; obstructing justice; and illegally crossing state
lines to accept the free trips.
   In a 148-page report explaining why it was recommending its most
severe punishment, the 12-member committee said, ``the offenses for
which Representative Biaggi was convicted involved criminal conduct
of a most serious nature going to the heart of his representational
responsibilities.''
   Biaggi has vowed to fight the expulsion resolution on the House
floor, but his spokesman, Bob Blancato, said the congressman needs
time to prepare his defense. He declined to say how much time.
   A resolution to expel must pass by a two-thirds vote of the
435-member House.
   The last member of Congress to be expelled was Rep. Michael
Myers, D-Pa., in 1980, who had been captured on videotape accepting
a $50,000 bribe in the Abscam sting.
   Biaggi was convicted Sept. 22 of illegally accepting a paid
Florida vacation from Meade Esposito, the former Brooklyn, N.Y.,
Democratic leader. Esposito was seeking government help for Coastal
Dry Dock and Repair Corp., a financially troubled Brooklyn shipyard
which owed $280,000 in premiums to Esposito's insurance brokerage
firm.
   Biaggi was sentenced to 2{ years in prison and a $500,000 fine.
He is free pending appeal.

   Here is a look at recent unrest involving some of
the Soviet Union's more than 100 national groups:
   ARMENIA _ Police broke up a demonstration in the capital,
Yerevan, on Oct. 18, 1987, by at least 1,000 people supporting
Armenian national rights in the village of Chardakhlu in
neighboring Azerbaidzhan, according to Moscow dissidents. As many
as 200,000 Armenians demonstrated in Yerevan this week to demand
annexation of an area of the neighboring republic of Azerbaidzhan
called Nagorno-Karabakh, witnesses report.
   AZERBAIDZHAN _ A clash between Azeris, the natives of
Azerbaidzhan, and long-time Armenian residents occurred in October
in Chardakhlu, according to Moscow dissidents.
   GEORGIA _ Thousands of Georgians staged an unsanctioned rally in
1979 in the capital, Tblisi, to protest the omission from the
republic's constitution of a phrase acknowledging Georgian as the
state language. About 100 people demonstrated in 1983 in the
capital, Tbilisi, after the arrest of two nationalist students.
   KAZAKZHSTAN _ Up to 3,000 people rioted Dec. 17-18, 1986, in the
capital, Alma Ata, to protest the appointment of an ethnic Russian
to replace an ethnic Kazakh as the republic's party chief. Two
people are killed, 200 injured and dozens arrested.
   CRIMEAN TATARS _ Members of this national group flocked to
Moscow in July 1987 and demonstrated in Red Square for the right to
return to their historic homeland along the Black Sea. This month,
the government endorsed steps to promote the culture of the Crimean
Tatars but indicated they won't be given privileges in their
homeland, from which they were expelled in 1944.
   LITHUANIA _ Five-hundred people gathered outside a church in the
capital, Vilnius, on Aug. 23, 1987, to protest on the anniversary
of the 1939 German-Soviet pact that allowed Soviet takeover of
Lithuania and the other formerly independent Baltic states.
Moscow-based dissidents report that police and soldiers beat
hundreds of Lithuanians in Vilnius as they gathered Feb. 16 to mark
their homeland's brief independence. A Soviet spokesman denied the
reports.
   ESTONIA _ A group of Estonian nationalists gathered in the
capital, Tallinn, on Aug. 23, 1987, to protest the German-Soviet
pact. Dissidents were denied permission to stage demonstrations
Wednesday to mark the days when their homeland declared
independence from Soviet Russia.
   LATVIA _ Five-thousand people assembled at a World War II
memorial in the capital, Riga, on June 14, 1987, to mark the 47th
anniversary of ``deportation day,'' when Josef V. Stalin sent
thousands of Baltic residents into exile at the time of the Soviet
takeover of their homelands. Up to 7,000 people gathered Aug. 23,
1987, at the memorial to protest the German-Soviet accord,
witnesses said.

   West Bank villagers burned the home of a fellow
Arab accused of helping the Israelis and lynched him after he fired
on a crowd Wednesday with a submachine gun, killing a 4-year-old
boy and wounding 13 people, security sources said.
   Israel radio called the event ``a serious escalation'' of 11
weeks of violence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
linked it to calls by the Palestine Liberation Organization for
harsh action against collaborators.
   A reporter for the Arabic-language Jerusalem newspaper Al Quds
said residents of Qabatiya village accused the man of collaborating
with Israeli authorities. The reporter, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, identified the man as Mohammed Al Ayad.
   Palestinians began a general strike in the occupied territories
Wednesday and the army reported the first attack on Israeli
soldiers with explosives and firearms since riots began Dec. 8.
   The army said a bomb exploded on a road near Gaza as a military
vehicle passed at about 11 p.m. Tuesday and shots were fired at the
soldiers, but no one was injured.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz arrives in Jerusalem on
Thursday to discuss a new U.S. plan for ending the unrest and
reviving negotiations for Middle East peace.
   Israel radio said hundreds of residents marched to the suspected
collaborator's house in Qabatiya, near Jenin, 60 miles north of
Jerusalem, and destroyed it with firebombs.
   Security sources said the man killed the boy and wounded the
others when he fired from the house at the attackers.
   The national Itim news agency said Ayad fired an Uzi submachine
gun and that after the shooting, people dragged him away and hanged
him. Security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the report, saying the man was strung up on a utility
pole.
   The Arab-run Palestine Press Service identified the slain boy as
Mohammed Qassem Abu Zeid Kmeil.
   An army spokesman called it a fight among Arabs and said
soldiers arrived later.
   At least 63 Arabs have been killed by Israelis since the
violence began, according to U.N. figures. About 1.5 million
Palestinians live in the West Bank and Gaza, which Israel captured
from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war.
   Three Arabs were shot and wounded Wednesday during disturbances
at the Nuserat refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, including a
9-year-old girl, hospital officials said. Several other
confrontations were reported between soldiers and young Arabs
throwing stones and burning tires in the streets.
   Jerusalem's police force has been strengthened for the Shultz
visit by 1,500 officers, to at least twice its normal size.
   The military also provided extra manpower at the request of
Jerusalem police, an army spokesman said.
   No details were available on the attack on the military vehicle.
   Palestinian protesters have avoided using firearms in what they
call ``the uprising'' against Israel, confining themselves to
throwing stones, bottles, and occasionally firebombs. Several knife
attacks have been reported.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat has said arms would not be used at this
stage, but did not rule out using guns and explosives later.
   Escalation of the violence could prompt an even harsher military
response and might cost the Arabs much of the sympathy they have
won abroad.
   In Jerusalem, police said about 20 Arabs were arrested in recent
days on suspicion of taking part in disturbances. All Palestinians
leaving Silwan, an Arab village inside the Jerusalem city limits,
were checked and searched Wednesday.
   A senior police officer at the scene said: ``We are throwing the
book at them: traffic violations, drug trafficking, not paying
taxes. The people in Silwan for the last two months thought they
belonged to Palestine. We are now teaching them they live in
Israel, and they will never forget it.''
   Amnesty International, the human rights organization based in
London, urged Israel to conduct a thorough investigation of human
rights violations.
   ``Sometimes soldiers have found themselves in the immediate
context where some force was necessary, or maybe even gunfire was
necessary, but in our view the step toward firing a combat rifle at
people who are not themselves armed with firearms is a very big
step to make,'' Clayton Yeo, head of research for Amnesty, said on
Israel radio.
   The general strike, called for Wednesday and Thursday by the
underground ``United National Leadership of the Uprising,''
appeared to be almost total.
   Few people were on the streets in the Gaza Strip. In the West
Bank, business was at a standstill.
   Shultz is likely to meet resistance in Jerusalem, particularly
from Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, whose right-wing Likud bloc
opposes the secretary's idea of trading land for peace.
   It also appeared Shultz will not be able to meet with
Palestinians during his Mideast shuttle between Jerusalem and Arab

the PLO has forbidden such a meeting in Jerusalem.
   A meeting with Palestinians is considered critical to the peace

   UCLA's Lambda Delta Lambda is believed to be
the nation's first sorority founded by lesbians, but the group's
nine charter members say they started out to make friends, not
history.
   ``When you meet someone from a sorority it's almost like a
built-in friendship,'' Marci Kaye, one of the group's founders,
said Wednesday. ``We just wanted something like that that we could
have, kind of a way for people to meet other people.''
   Officials of the sprawling University of California, Los
Angeles, campus in Westwood formally recognized Lambda Delta Lambda
as a campus organization last week.
   ``It was very validating for us,'' said sorority President
Allison Adler, a junior creative writing major.
   University regulations forbid exclusion of heterosexuals who may
want to join, and Krisi Burk, the group's spokeswoman, said Lambda
Delta Lambda hopes to sign up some heterosexual women during
sorority rush week next month.
   ``If they're comfortable with us, then we're comfortable with
them,'' said the 20-year-old junior political science major.
   She said several heterosexual women have inquired about joining,
and the group hopes to at least double its membership next month.
   ``I hope people don't think our non-discriminatory policy is a
paper policy because it's not,'' she said. ``I have a lot of
straight friends and I'd like to see them all join.''
   Several Lambda Delta Lambda members said they considered
pledging traditional Greek sororities before forming their own.
They said they were frightened away by stories of lesbian members
who had been ostracized after their sexual preferences became known.
   ``Maybe I'm just paranoid, but I don't always feel comfortable
about traditional sororities,'' Ms. Burk said.
   Now that she's a member of her own group, she spoke excitedly as
she outlined some of Lambda Delta Lambda's plans for the weeks
ahead, including participation in rush week, the spring Mardi Gras
carnival, homecoming and other campus activities.
   Also high on the agenda will be raising the money to rent a
sorority house. The group now meets on campus.
   Ms. Burk said the sorority hopes to get more involved in
political issues than most traditional Greek letter organizations,
including efforts on behalf of women, gays and minorities.
   She said the group can also serve as a support network for its
gay members.
   ``We've all had family problems or at least tense moments,'' she
said. ``We can help each other.''
   In her case, after the group went public she decided to tell her
grandparents she was a lesbian ``because I was afraid someone might
... send them a letter.'' She said they took the news well.
   Thus far, members said, reaction to the sorority has been
generally positive.
   ``Yesterday in one of my classes someone approached me and said
he thought it was very courageous what we were doing,'' said Ms.
Kaye, a 25-year-old senior English major.
   Ms. Burk noted that one person did complain in a letter to the
editor of the campus newspaper, the Daily Bruin, that if lesbians
were allowed to share a sorority house it would be the same as
allowing men and women to share sorority and fraternity houses. She
dismissed the argument with a chuckle.
   ``It's not just a sexual thing, which of course everybody thinks
it is,'' she said of the sorority. ``It's no more sexual than any
collection of human beings.''

<TEXT>
   The 159-nation General Assembly will
convene Monday on the dispute between the United States and the
United Nations over the fate of the Palestine Liberation
Organization mission, U.N. officials said.
   Congress passed an anti-terrorism law ordering the PLO observer
mission closed by March 22, despite a 1947 treaty in which the
United States agreed to let official delegations function in New
York, the U.N. headquarters.
   ``The legislation is really an assault on the independence of
the United Nations and on its integrity,'' said former U.S.
Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who has been providing legal advice
to the PLO.
   State Department and U.N. officials also said closing the
mission would violate the treaty under which the United States
became U.N. headquarters.
   But Attorney General Edwin Meese III has reportedly said he
intends to enforce the measure.
   What plan of action the General Assembly might advance at the
special session is not clear. It has already passed a resolution
calling on the United States to leave the mission alone.
   The PLO and the 21-nation Arab League say the assembly may ask
the International Court of Justice in Holland for a ruling. The PLO
and the league have also said they may ask the assembly to move
from New York to Geneva if the United States closes the mission.
   Clark said binding arbitration, as called for in the treaty, is
the best way to resolve the dipute. He said the PLO would bring
suit in a U.S. court ``only as a last resort.''
   The PLO was given official observer status 13 years ago. Its
mission is a Manhattan townhouse with a staff of three political
officers and two secretaries.

<HEAD>Judge Orders April 15 Ban on Termite Pesticides Chlordane,
Heptachlor</HEAD>

   A federal judge on Wednesday gave the
Environmental Protection Agency until April 15 to ban the sale and
commercial use of products containing an anti-termite pesticide
believed to cause cancer.
   U.S. District Judge Louis Oberdorfer ruled that the EPA had
acted illegally by allowing 197 holders of federal pesticide
licenses to sell existing stocks of products containing the
pesticides chlordane and heptachlor.
   Oberdorfer said EPA failed to take into account whether
continued sale or use of the products ``would pose any unreasonable
risk to man or the environment.''
   EPA scientists have concluded that chlordane causes cancer and
excessive residues remain in homes even after proper application of
the chemical, which is usually injected into soil around the
foundations of houses.
   Last year, Velsicol Chemical Corp., the nation's only
manufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor, agreed to stop selling
the chemical while it tries to find an acceptable method of
applying the pesticide.
   But the EPA's agreement with Velsicol did not cover products
containing chlordane made by other companies for the retail market.
   EPA separately agreed to allow 197 companies that hold federal
pesticide licenses to sell existing stocks of their chlordane
products if they surrendered their licenses.
   The agency estimates these companies have 1,700 pounds of
chlordane products in their stocks compared with the 110,000 pounds
in Velsicol's inventory.
   The judge found that EPA's decision to permit continued sale of
the products ``is arbitrary, capricious and an abuse of
discretion'' and violates the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and
Rodenticide Act.
   EPA spokesman Albert Heier said the judge's decision ``has
really tied our hands on this one because it will actually result
in the product returning to the market.''
   ``If we go ahead and ban these products, they can appeal the
ban,'' Heier said. ``Under the law, the registrants can appeal, and
while it's under appeal they can manufacture and sell'' the
chemicals.
   ``That 's the reason we went on the voluntary route,'' Heier
said. ``It will take two years to get rid of them. We thought we
could get rid of them faster this way.''
   Jay Feldman, a spokesman for the National Coalition Against the
Misuse of Pesticides, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against
the EPA, said the agency can always use its emergency powers to
suspend use of chlordane.
   ``They have assumed they have no authority to use their
emergency powers, and that is certainly incorrect,'' Feldman said.
   ``They have simply misused their discretionary authority in this
case and refused to consider emergency suspsnsion,'' Feldman said.
   ``If EPA believes that application of the regulatory standards
in FIFRA results in extended product life and the only way to
protect public health and the environment is to circumvent FIFTRA,
they should be seeking statutory changes,'' Feldman said.
   Besides the coalition, the lawsuit was brought by 10 other
environmental groups and two labor unions.

   Doctors who believe any humanitarian aid to
Nicaraguans must help both sides in the conflict said Wednesday
they are seeking $20 million to set up an American hospital in the
war-torn country.
   They want the money from Congress, which is voting on a
Democrat-sponsored aid package Thursday, but say they'll try to
raise it elsewhere if necessary. The hospital proposal has been
sent to congressional leaders but is not included in the Democrats'
plan.
   Dr. William Burman of the newly formed Pan American Trauma
Association said he and Swiss Dr. Hansjurg Holdener would be
willing to work for one year in Nicaragua to set up the facility
which they said should include three airplanes, 10 ambulances and a
150-bed hospital to treat Sandinista, Contra and civilian victims.
   Burman described the proposal as an unprecedented offer by
American doctors to help the United States provide humanitarian aid
to Central America. He provided a list a dozen doctors supporting
the project and said U.S. doctors would work in Nicaragua for a
salary of no more than $20,000 a year.
   ``There is no way to consider food and clothing for an army
engaged in a war as humanitarian,'' said Chris Orsinger of the
Council on Hemispheric Affairs, which sponsored a news conference
with the doctors and endorsed their project. The council describes
itself as a nonpartisan supporter of democratic political processes
in the Western Hemisphere.
   Burman said he resigned as an assistant professor of orthopedic
surgery at the State University of New York to work full-time on
the Nicaraguan proposal. He and Holdener said they met last
November with medical officials in Nicaragua and toured the area
where the hospital would be set up.
   Burman said East Germany, Cuba and Czechoslovakia all have
hospitals in Nicaragua, which he said are apparently open to all
victims of the conflict.
   He said the U.S. hospital proposal was intended to ``put the
United States' best foot forward in the region and express the
highest ideals of medical ethics.''
   Wilson Morris, an aide to House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas,
said congressional leaders had seen the doctors' proposal, but
funding for it it was not included in the Democrats' $30.5 million
Contra aid measure which Wright said he is confident will pass. The
House narrowly defeated President Reagan's proposal for $36.2
million in military and other aid to the Contras three weeks ago.
   The Democrats propose to give $14.6 million for food, clothing,
medicine and shelter for the rebels and about the same amount for
medical aid to Nicaraguan children who are victims of the conflict.
An additional $1.4 million would go for aid to Miskito Indians, who
ended their resistance to the Sandinista government earlier this
month.

<TEXT>
   The quintessential chanteusse, Liliane
Montevecchi, has brought the songs, the movements, and all the
atmosphere of the cosiest French cabaret to the off-Broadway
Kaufman Theater.
   The petite singer, with gamin face and haircut, wins the
audience before she sings a note. She wears a long-sleeve,
high-neck, black minidress which almost covers her black leotard,
revealing slim, shapely legs in black hose and spike heels.
   When she sings, her voice proves even more winning. And her
jolie, unflappable air delights.
   Draping herself across the top of Joel Silberman's upright piano
to sing what she calls ``New Frangles Tango,'' she says: ``This
song, I have not done it yet once perfectly.'' She flubs the first
line; everybody laughs, and she starts over.
   Miss Montevecchi's show, ``On the Boulevard,'' which opened
Monday night, wisely varies its mood. She dips into bittersweet
regret, a mood which fits a French singer so well _ but only does
it a couple of times. And she throws herself entirely into songs,
but again not too often, fervently raising temperature and volume.
   She has a light touch with humor and exquisite timing.
Introducing Cole Porter's ``You Don't Know Paree,'' her voice is as
beautifully inflected as any dramatic actress conveying emotion as
she says, ``I have friends there. Some are still there and some are
gone.''
   Miss Montevecchi's French-accented English singing has been
heard here before, in ``Nine'' on Broadway. Here, she often moves
directly from one song to the next, so the audience doesn't break
its French enchantement with applause.
   Lighting by Jeffrey Schissler is subtle and effective. Martin R.
Kaufman, who owns the tiny theater, with seats on two sides of the
stage, is the presenter in association with Jean-Claude Baker.

   The House on Wednesday unanimously condemned
North Korea for the bombing last year of a South Korean airliner
that killed 115 people aboard.
   On a 396-0 vote the House approved the resolution, which urges
``other countries, particularly with close relations with North
Korea,'' to adopt sanctions and other measures against the
Pyongyang government.
   ``The bombing was one of the most outrageous acts of terrorism
perpetrated since the end of the Second World War,'' said Rep.
Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House subcommittee on Asian
affairs.
   Kim Hyun-hee, a surviving member of an alleged two-agent North
Korean team, confessed on South Korean television that she helped
plant a time bomb on Korean Air Lines Flight 858 before leaving the
plane in Abu Dhabi. The plane exploded off Burma.
   Solarz said the United States has ``fairly persuasive''
independent evidence of North Korean responsility for the bombing.

<HEAD>Program Would Allow Britons, Japanese To Enter US Without Visas</HEAD>

   Britain and Japan have been asked to
participate in a program that would allow their subjects to visit
the United States for up to 90 days without a visa, a State
Department spokeswoman said Wednesday.
   A 1986 immigration law authorized the State Department and
Immigration and Naturalization Service to approach up to eight
countries to see if they were interested in participating in a
pilot project to determine if visa requirements could be waived in
some cases.
   Britain announced earlier this week that it is interested in
taking part in the program, and U.S. spokeswoman Ruth van Heuven
confirmed that Japan also has been asked to participate.
   Current rules require all visitors, except Canadians, Bahamians
and some Mexicans, to obtain a visa to come to the United States.
The normal process is for U.S. embassies to rule on visa
applications and check the names against lists of people barred
from entry.
   Visitors from some nations are required to prove they have the
means and the intention to go home again.
   The pilot program would allow tourists and business people from
the two countries to come to the United States for 90 days or less
without going through that process.
   Among those for whom visas are required, Britons and Japanese
top the list of visitors to the United States. Last year, the State
Department issued nearly 1.2 million visas to citizens of Japan and
496,000 visas to Britons.
   Those two countries also are high up on the list of countries
where visa applications are rarely rejected.
   Van Heuven said the program would not go into effect until the
Immigration and Naturalization Service completes the installation
of an automated arrival and departure system that would permit
authorities to monitor people coming and going from the United
States. A completion date for the system has not been announced.
   Under the 1986 law, the program would permit entry by people
with round-trip, non-transferable tickets, valid for a year or less
and not refundable in the United States.
   Carriers also would be required to certify that they will
provide return transportation for the visitors.
   Participating countries also would have to waive visa
requirements for U.S. visitors. Britain does not require visas for
Americans, but Japan does.

   Her mother wanted her to return home to
Massachusetts, but 17-year-old Lenora Rolle wanted to stretch her
vacation in New York by just one day. It turned out to be her last.
   ``I begged and pleaded with her to come home,'' Coralie Rolle
said after learning that her daughter had been shot to death at a
party in Brooklyn. ``I missed her. I wanted her back. I didn't like
her being there too long. I begged her to be careful.''
   Miss Rolle, a high school senior in Cambridge, Mass., had used
the money she earned as a cashier at Warburton's pastry shop in
Harvard Square to finance the trip to New York, where she stayed
with aunts in the Bronx.
   Detectives say she was at the Port Authority Bus Terminal in
Manhattan on Monday night with a 15-year-old friend, identified
only as Bianca, when the two were lured away from their
Boston-bound bus by a peddler of exotic fragrances.
   The man, who may have known Bianca, urged the girls to go to a
party at his mother's house in Brooklyn, and promised to pay their
bus fare home.
   ``She was a good girl, but she liked to party,'' her mother
said. She also said that Lenora was not very streetwise.
   Police Sgt. Arthur Stoecker, who is investigating the case, said
at least seven people were at the party; one of those in attendance
told New York Newsday that there were about 15. Stoecker said a few
empty crack vials were found in the apartment afterward.
   After Miss Rolle arrived, police and witnesses say, she was
approached by a man who demanded to have sex with her.
   ``Is she for me? Is this one for me?'' the man asked, according
to a witness quoted by the New York Post.
   When Miss Rolle refused, the man pulled out a 9mm hand-held
machine gun and fired two shots into the floor, authorities said.
He then forced her to undress and, as she screamed in protest,
dragged her into a bedroom.
   The other partygoers fled in terror. ``They were fearful for
their own lives,'' Stoecker said.
   He said the witnesses tried to telephone police, but were unable
to get into an apartment building across the street. A street phone
was out of order, they said.
   After about a half-hour, they saw the gunman, still clutching
his pistol, leave the building. When they entered, they found Miss
Rolle dead.
   An autopsy Wednesday determined that she had been shot in the
back, the right thigh and the left arm, according to a spokeswoman
for the city Medical Examiner's office, Ellen Borakove. Samples
were sent to a lab to determine if Miss Rolle had been raped.
   Stoecker said police were searching Wednesday for a 20-year-old
man with a previous felony conviction, but no official warrant had
been issued.
   The man spent two weeks in jail in 1986 on a misdemeanor sexual
misconduct conviction, then was sentenced to three to nine years
after pleading guilty to attempted robbery, officials said.
   Criminal court records indicate the sentencing was imposed in
absentia, and prison officials said there was no record that he had
served the time.
   At Warburton's pastry shop, which serves soups and pastries to a
clientele heavily weighted with Harvard students and professors,
manager Ed Buschard recalled Lenora Rolle as ``a very desirable
employee.''
   ``I thought that she was a good worker,'' Buschard said. ``She
came in on days when I was shorthanded. If I needed someone to
work, she would work. ... She probably was a very popular girl in
school, because she got along with everybody here at work. She
seemed like a very outgoing girl.
   ``Everybody's pretty shaken up. It's a shock to everybody.''

   A key prosecution witness in the
sedition trial of members of a white supremacist group testified
under cross-examination from a defendant that he receives direct
guidance from God.
   After the government used Jim Ellison's testimony to implicate
many of the 10 men accused of plotting the violent overthrow of the
government, defendant Louis Ray Beam Jr. questioned Ellison on his
religious beliefs.
   Ellison testified Tuesday ``a prophet of God'' led him to settle
in Arkansas, where he was annointed ``King of the Ozarks'' by
Robert Millar, leader of a religious group in Oklahoma.
   Ellison also said he has the gift of prophecy and is a
descendant of the biblical King David.
   ``Has anyone ever suggested to you before today that you, sir,
might be paranoid?'' Beam asked.
   ``Before today, I've heard it,'' Ellison said.
   Beam and nine others, including Aryan Nations leader Richard
Butler, are accused of seditious conspiracy. The 10, and four
others on trial, espouse white supremacist goals or belong to white
supremacist groups, the government alleges.
   Those four, and one of the accused conspirators, are charged
with plotting to kill a federal judge and an FBI agent. Two also
are accused of interstate transportation of stolen money. Those
charged with conspiring to overthrow the government face maximum
sentences of 20 years in prison and $20,000 fines if convicted,
while the charge of plotting to kill federal officials carries a
maximum life sentence.
   The government contends the conspiracy involved actions to kill
Jews, who were seen by the white supremacists as in charge of the
United States government.
   Ellison has testified that in 1983, members of an Arkansas-based
religious-military group he led had participated in a murder,
robberies and attempts to blow up utility facilities.
   Ellison is serving 20 years for racketeering and weapons
violations committed when he led the group, called the Covenant,
the Sword and the Arm of the Lord. He was arrested in 1985 after a
four-day standoff.
   Richard Wayne Snell, a member of Ellison's group, is on death
row in Arkansas for the 1983 murder of Texarkana pawn broker
William Stumpp.
   Ellison testified that Snell, one of the 14 on trial here,
decided to kill the pawn broker because he considered him to be
``an evil man, he was a Jew, and that he just needed to die.''
   Snell also is serving a sentence of life without parole for the
1984 slaying of state Trooper Louis Bryant.
   Ellison said Beam and others agreed in 1983 at Hayden Lake,
Idaho, to step up activities to bring down the government and
replace it with an all-white state in the Northwest.
   Ellison also has testified that defendant Robert Miles, 63, of
Cohoctah, Mich., gave him a 30-gallon barrel of cyanide to poison
the water supplies of New York or Washington, D.C., to create civil
unrest.
   Butler, 69, of the Aryan Nations group, gave approval for the
CSA to provide sanctuary to members of The Order when they were
``in trouble with the law,'' Ellison said.
   At a trial in Seattle, more than 20 people, many of them members
of The Order, were convicted of racketeering for robberies of banks
and armored cars. Some of the defendants in the Fort Smith case
were sentenced in the Seattle case.

<HEAD>Fat People Get That Way Because They Burn Less Energy</HEAD>

   Overweight people often get that way because their
bodies burn calories more sparingly than normal-size folks', and
this difference between the fat and the lean can be seen in the
first months of life, two new studies show.
   Together, the studies demonstrate that whether people are chubby
or svelte may depend as much on how efficiently their bodies use
energy as it does on what they eat.
   In one of the studies, researchers found that fat babies _ all
of whom had overweight mothers _ were already expending less energy
than other infants when they were just 3 months old.
   ``Low energy expenditure in infants seems to be making them
become overweight,'' said Dr. Susan B. Roberts of Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, who directed the study.
   The other report found that some grownups have lower metabolic
rates, or energy expenditure, than others. They need less food to
keep going, and they gain weight more quickly.
   ``It all boils down to how much you eat and how much you expend.
Some people are just unlucky enough that they can't eat too much,''
said a co-author of the adult study, Dr. Clifton Bogardus of the
National Institutes of Health in Phoenix, Ariz.
   Other studies have shown that fat people often use up relatively
low amounts of calories when resting. But a crucial question
remained: Is their metabolism low because they are fat, or are they
fat because their metabolism is low?
   By following people over time, the new studies conclude that
people get fat because their bodies are especially fuel efficient,
although overeating also aggravates this problem. But when two
people the same height and sex eat the same amount, it appears that
one may stay trim while the other gets chubby, solely because of
this difference in metabolism.
   ``What's being shown here is that there is some broad pattern of
vulnerability to weight gain,'' commented Dr. William I. Bennett of
Harvard Medical School. ``They are starting to get awfully close to
showing that there is a set of genes'' that controls obesity.
   The two latest studies were published in Thursday's issue of the
New England Journal of Medicine.
   In the infant study, doctors studied six babies who were born to
lean mothers and 12 who were born to overweight women. They used a
newly developed urine test called the doubly labeled water method
to measure the infants' energy expenditure while living at home.
   At age 3 months, all of the babies were normal sized. But by age
1, six of the fat mothers' babies had become overweight. Total
energy expenditure at 3 months was 21 percent lower in the infants
who later became fat.
   The researchers theorize that these babies have an inherited
tendency to be fat. Their bodies have a high ``set point,'' or
weight goal. They try to reach this point by taking in more energy
or using up less.
   Roberts said she believes that the fat babies ate no more than
the normal ones. So they put on weight to reach their set point by
being less active.
   ``That would be a logical thing to do in small infants, because
their food intake is largely controlled by their mothers, so they
didn't have the option of going to the fridge and having another
sandwich,'' she said. ``But in adults, who have the option of going
to the fridge, high food intake may also contribute to the
maintenance of being overweight.''
   The Phoenix study was conducted on Pima Indians, who have a high
rate of obesity. Researchers measured their energy expenditure
while resting and while living for 24 hours in a small room.
   They found that those whose 24-hour energy expenditure was low
were four times more likely than those with high metabolisms to
gain over 17 pounds during the following two years. They also found
that low and high metabolisms tend to run in families.
   ``It means that some people have to eat less than others to
maintain their weight. It's like they always said, but nobody ever
believed,'' said Bogardus.
   He said he hopes the research will help convince doctors that
``everyone who is fat isn't that way just because they are
gluttonous slobs. They have something wrong.''

   Estonian nationalists shouted ``Get the Russians
Out!'' in the streets of Tallinn on Wednesday to commemorate the
small Baltic nation's brief generation of independence from the
Soviet Union, which ended in 1940.
   Tass noted the demonstration, the latest expression of unrest
among the nation's more than 100 nationalities. The official news
agency did not say how many people took part, but a Moscow
dissident in touch with an Estonian journalist put the number at
2,500 to 3,000.
   The Associated Press could not get a telephone call through to
Tallinn, the Estonian capital, to verify the reports.
   Wednesday was the anniversary of Estonia's declaration of
independence in 1918. The Soviets took it back in 1940 under a
secret agreement with Nazi Germany.
   Nationalists in Estonia had asked official permission for a
demonstration Wednesday but were refused.
   Alexander Podrabinek, the Moscow dissident, gave this account of
the day's events in Tallinn:
   About 1,000 people gathered in the downtown area late in the
afternoon for an official rally intended as a protest of what the
government called U.S. provocation of Estonian nationalists.
   Nationalists rallied in a Tallinn square Wednesday night at a
monument to Estonian writer Antonu-Hansenu Tammsaare, laying
flowers on it as militiamen watched. Plainclothes police
photographed the protesters.
   An elderly man began speaking to the crowd about Estonian
independence and militiamen tried to take him away, but other
demonstrators intervened. The militiamen backed off and remained at
a distance for the rest of the three-hour rally.
   Speakers shouted ``Independence to Estonia!'' and ``Get the
Russians Out!''
   Authorities brought in a bus with a loudspeaker blaring music
and official propaganda. Demonstrators were invited to hold their
discussion in the warmth of nearby buildings, but most refused.
   No one was detained and the people remaining outside dispersed
on their own.
   Tass quoted Tallinn's mayor, Harry Lumi, as saying people
gathered at the monument to discuss ``the actual problems of
modernity and the historic past of Estonia.''
   Lumi said the demonstrators were invited to go inside buildings
to continue their discussion because it was cold and windy, Tass
said, and quoted him as saying:
   ``There occurred an improvised meeting with leading scientists
of the republic, deputies of the city council. Problems of the
economic development of Estonia, national relations, ecology and
the democratization of society were discussed.''
   Podrabinek said his information came from a correspondent in
Tallinn for the underground weekly ``Express Chronicle,'' which
Podrabinek edits.
   Nationalists in Tallinn also demonstrated on Aug. 23 against the
German-Soviet pact under which the Soviets annexed Estonia.

<HEAD>Dry Day In Most Places, `Lake-Effect' Snow Around Great Lakes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow fell Wednesday across much of the Great Lakes region, the
upper Ohio Valley and the central Appalachians, and light rain fell
in southern Florida, while most of the rest of the nation had dry
weather.
   Winds gusting to 35 mph caused ``whiteout'' snow squalls in
eastern Upper Michigan, particularly west of Sault Ste. Marie.
   Up to 8 inches of snow were forecast for the Erie, Pa.,
lakeshore, which receives ``lake-effect'' snow brought by cold air
blowing across the Great Lakes.
   A snow squall warning was posted in upstate New York. Up to 6
inches of snow were reported at Boonville, N.Y., overnight.
   Snow advisories went up across northwestern Pennsylvania and
extreme northeastern Ohio. Three to 7 inches of snow fell in
Astabula County, Ohio, early Wednesday.
   Heavier snowfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included 3 inches at Erie, Pa., and 1 inch at Grand Rapids, Mich.
   Clear to partly cloudy skies prevailed elsewhere across the
nation. Rainfall was largely limited to a few light showers in
southern Florida.
   Northwesterly winds of 15 to 25 mph with a few gusts to around
30 mph were common across the Midwest. The wind, combined with
midday temperatures in the teens and 20s, produced subzero
wind-chill readings across the upper Midwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 8
degrees at International Falls, Minn., to 80 degrees at Homestead,
Fla., and Fort Myers, Fla. The early-morning low for the nation was
17 below zero at Gunnison, Colo.
   The forecast for Thursday called for scattered snow in upper
Michigan, the lower Great Lakes region and the central
Appalachians, and rain in southwestern California.
   Highs were forecast in the 20s and 30s from the Dakotas across
the northeastern quarter of the nation, except from eastern
Minnesota across Upper Michigan, where highs in the teens were
forecast. Highs in the low 60s were forecast for parts of
southwestern Oregon, Louisiana and southern Mississippi, and in the
60s and 70s from California through much of Texas and in Florida.
The rest of the nation will generally have highs in the 40s or 50s.

<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Milos Jakes
pledged to implement reform in Czechoslovakia Wednesday, while at
the same time denouncing the ``Prague Spring'' reforms crushed by
Warsaw Pact forces 20 years ago.
   Jakes spoke at a celebration marking the 40th anniversary of
Communist rule here, on the same day that Czechoslovakia and East
Germany announced the imminent removal of Soviet nuclear missiles.
   Czechoslovakia was the last country in Eastern Europe to turn
Communist, setting the seal on Kremlin domination of the region.
   The 65-year-old Jakes gave little indication he is about to
plunge into economic and political reforms now being enacted in the
Soviet Union, Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria.
   Jakes took over party leadership last December from Gustav
Husak, now 75. His hourlong speech to about 500 Communists in the
resplendent white and gold Spanish Hall of Prague's Hradcany Castle
displayed the same cautious conservatism that characterized Husak's
leadership for 18 years.
   He had harsh words for the Communists who, under the leadership
of Alexander Dubcek, tried in 1968 to introduce some of the reforms
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev advocates today.
   As head of the party's chief disciplinary body from 1968-77,
Jakes was responsible for purging almost half a million people from
the Communist Party after Soviet-led Warsaw Pact tanks crushed the
1968 reforms.
   On Wednesday, Jakes denied there is any need to reassess the
official view of 1968 and rejected any comparison between Dubcek's
reforms and Gorbachev's perestroika, or restructuring, of Communist
society.
   Without mentioning Dubcek by name, Jakes said Czechoslovaks were
hopeful and supportive when Dubcek was made party leader in January
1968, but that anti-socialist forces ``frustrated the great
opportunity that occurred for the solution of important problems.''
   ``The healthy forces in the party and society saw this growing
danger and conducted a difficult and complicated struggle against
it,'' Jakes said.
   He said Dubcek failed to ally with these forces, and a ``tragic
development'' was averted only ``thanks to the international
assistance of our friends.'' Public reference to the Warsaw Pact
invasion has been rare over the past year.
   Jakes went on to praise Husak, who presided over the ceremonial
meeting, the first official event to mark the Communist takeover in
February 1948.
   The Communists got almost 40 percent of the vote in elections in
1946, but assumed sole power only after a series of political
maneuvers during street demonstrations from Feb.20-25, 1948.
   ``It was no Communist coup, as it's always described by hostile
propaganda,'' Jakes said of the 1948 takeover. ``It was the will of
the people.''
   Jakes' speech set off celebrations that will include a mass
rally Thursday in Prague's Old Town Square, scene of a triumphant
speech by then Communist Party leader Klement Gottwald on Feb. 21,
1948.
   Jakes' speech signaled that his leadership is likely to be
conservative, despite official talk of economic reform.
   Czechoslovakia's Communists adopted the rhetoric of reform a
year ago, but a much-delayed blueprint for economic changes will be
published only later this week and reforms are not to be finally be
implemented until 1991.
   Political change is scarcely mentioned. Jakes made clear it will
not _ as in Hungary, Poland and even the Soviet Union _ lead to a
dialogue between Communists and unofficial opposition groups.
   ``The broadening of democratization in no case means the
creation of space for the legalization of political opposition
which, as all experiences to date show, cannot be other than
anti-socialist,'' he said.
   In announcing the imminent removal of Soviet missiles, East
Germany and Czechoslovakia hailed the move as a goodwill gesture
before the U.S. Congress votes on ratification of the superpower
arms treaty.
   East Germany said removal of shorter-range SS-12 missiles from
its territory would begin Thursday. Czechoslovakia's Communist
Party daily newspaper Rude Pravo said withdrawal of SS-12s deployed
here would begin in ``the next few days.''
   Neither country specified how many rockets will be removed, nor
how long the process will take.
   The announcements came one day after U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz ended a Moscow visit and talks with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   East Germany said last week that SS-12s there had been
dismantled and were ready for removal, but did not say then when
withdrawal would begin.
   Under the arms control agreement signed by the United States and
the Soviet Union last December in Washington, all intermediate and
shorter-range nuclear weapons in Europe will be scrapped within
three years.

<TEXT>
   St. Joseph's Aspirin for Children, once a
leader in over-the-counter pain relief for youngsters, is slowly
disappearing from medicine cabinets.
   The manufacture of the chewable orange tablets ended in December
1986 as Shering Plough Corp. of Madison focuses on chewable
low-dosage aspirin products for adults concerned about preventing
heart disease.
   Aspirin-free pain relievers and name-brand aspirin products
competed with each other until the American Academy of Pediatrics,
in a report in 1982, said giving aspirin to children suffering from
chicken pox and influenza increased the risk of contracting Reye's
syndrome.
   The illness is fatal in about 20 percent to 30 percent of the
cases, and some survivors suffer permanent brain damage. The
government in 1986 ordered warning labels on all aspirin bottles
about the risk to children and teen-agers of contracting Reye's
syndrome.
   The market ``dropped considerably from 1980 with the Reye's
syndrome business,'' said Terry Kelly, a spokesman for Sterling
Drug Inc. of New York, which still manufactures Bayer's Aspirin for
Children.
   ``We feel there are certain patients for whom children's aspirin
is appropriate,'' Kelly said.
   St. Joseph's Aspirin for Children, first marketed in 1949, was
replaced with aspirin-free tablets called St. Joseph's Aspirin-Free
Fever Reducer.
   Jim Saberton, a consultant with Kline & Co. Inc. in Fairfield,
said Wednesday that the children's aspirin market has become
relatively small with sales of about $15 million in 1986 compared
with sales of about $115 million for the non-aspirin pain reliever
acetominophen that same year.
   ``The risk and work involved in making aspirin is unattractive,
especially since there's acetominophen,'' he said.
   St. Joseph's Aspirin for Children and Bayer Children's Aspirin
each had about $5 million in sales in 1986, with the balance of
sales taken up by generic brands, he said.
   He also said Johnson & Johnson's Tylenol products, which use
acetominophen, cut heavily into sales of St. Joseph's, which once
held 50 percent of the children's pain-reliever market while Bayer
had the other half.
   Lewis Nolan, a Schering Plough spokesman, said, however, that
his company disputes the link of aspirin to Reye's syndrome.
   ``It's been our position that there's been no scientific valid
evidence to link aspirin and Reye's syndrome,'' he said.
   St. Joseph's Low Dose Adult Aspirin was introduced last month,
although the company makes no claim in relation to aspirin's
effectiveness against heart disease. The low dose aspirin product
label advises it not be given to young children, he said.
   Kelly said his company showed higher sales of Bayer Children's
Aspirin during 1987, although he could not say if it was due to
Shering Plough leaving the market.
   ``I think the first increase you saw was ours last year. I
cannot analyze why that is,'' he said.

   Czechoslovakia and East Germany
said they will start removing shorter-range Soviet nuclear missiles
from their territory Thursday.
   Dmitri T. Yazov, the Soviet defense minister, said Monday while
Secretary of State George P. Shultz was in Moscow that withdrawal
of the SS-12s would begin this month as a ``display of goodwill.''
   The weapons must be eliminated under the U.S.-Soviet treaty on
intermediate-range nuclear arms signed in December, which has yet
to be ratified.
   Dusan Rovensky, spokesman for the Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry,
said Wednesday: ``Under an agreement between the Czechoslovak and
Soviet governments, the withdrawal of Soviet army rocket units
armed with operational-tactical missiles from Czechoslovak
territory will start on Feb. 25.''
   CTK, the official news agency, said the Defense Ministry
confirmed the announcement.
   A brief announcement by the East German diplomatic mission in
Bonn, West Germany, said: ``Withdrawal of the Soviet shorter-range
missiles from the German Democratic Republic will begin on Febrary
25 (Thursday), 1988.''
   East Germany announced last week that Soviet SS-12s stationed at
Waren had been dismantled, crated and prepared for return to the
Soviet Union.
   According to figures released after the treaty was signed, there
are 54 SS-12s in East Germany. Czechoslovakia has not said how many
Soviet missiles were installed on its territory, but Western
analysts put the number at 39.
   The intermediate-range treaty requires elimination of nuclear
weapons with ranges between 300 and 3,000 miles.
   East Germany said missiles would be removed Thursday from Waren
and another site at Bischofswerda. The only location ever given for
the weapons in Czechoslovakia was a military base near Hranice, 180
miles southeast of Prague.
   In 1983, NATO began installing U.S.-built cruise and Pershing 2
missiles in Western Europe to counteract Soviet SS-20s pointed at
the West. The Kremlin responded by moving some SS-12s from bases in
the Soviet Union to East Germany and Czechoslovakia.

   Foreign ministers from six Balkan
nations meet in Belgrade Wednesday to discuss ways of ending
conflicts in the area, long troubled by regional disputes.
   The three-day session will be the first such conference since
World War II.
   Military, ethnic, environmental and political disputes mar
relations among the six.
   Ministers from NATO allies Greece and Turkey, Warsaw Pact
members Bulgaria and Romania and non-aligned Yugoslavia and Albania
arrived in Belgrade Tuesday.
   At a meeting in Sofia, Bulgaria, on Monday, Prime Minister
Andreas Papandreou of Greece and Bulgarian leader Todor Zhivkov
said the Balkan conference should be a forum for cooperation.
   ``We hope that this meeting will turn into an institution,'' the
official Bulgarian news agency BTA quoted Papandreou as saying in a
dinner speech. He suggested that such meetings be held every two
years.
   BTA quoted Zhivkov as saying the conference first ``should
discuss the questions that unite us.
   ``We do not underestimate the contradictions and the
difficulties between the Balkan states, but they must continue to
be discussed on a bilateral and multilateral basis.''
   Although the conference is expected to focus largely on
economic, scientific and cultural cooperation, festering issues are
expected to be raised.
   Bulgaria and Greece are likely to raise the possibility of
establishing a nuclear-free zone in the Balkans, a proposal opposed
by Turkey.
   Turkish and Greek diplomats, however, have said they won't raise
the dispute over Cyprus, which is divided by forces loyal to each
nation.
   The Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug has reported that Bulgaria
plans to propose a special Balkan conference on environmental
issues, apparently to take Romania to task for pollution on the
Bulgarian-Romanian border area.
   One potential problem apparently was resolved Tuesday when
Bulgaria and Turkey signed a protocol on good neighborly relations.
   A Turkish diplomat had said earlier his delegation planned to
raise the issue of Bulgaria's ethnic Turkish minority at the
conference. Bulgaria's estimated 1 million ethnic Turks were forced
by the government to adopt Bulgarian names as part of a
``Bulgarization campaign.''
   The protocol was seen as a clear indication that the two
neighbors seek to normalize relations after years of discord.
   Ethnic tensions also strain relations between Albania and
Yugoslavia, which has a large Albanian minority in the southern
province of Kosovo.
   ``There are many problems that we must review, concerning both
bilateral cooperation and cooperation among the Balkan countries in
general, in order to create an atmosphere of confidence,'' Albanian
Foreign Minister Reis Malile said in a television interview upon
his arrival in Belgrade.
   Malile is the highest-ranking Albanian to visit Yugoslavia in 40
years. Albania strongly condemned Yugoslavia's decision in 1948 to
break with the Soviet loc, but 20 years later Albania followed suit.

   Alexei Magarik, a Jewish cellist
imprisoned in the Soviet Union on charges of drug possession,
arrived in Israel on Wednesday after a five-year struggle for an
exit visa.
   Magarik, 28, was accompanied by his wife Natasha, 26, and their
2-year-old son Chaim.
   Magarik, a poet and songwriter, was active in Jewish musical
groups in Moscow. He first applied for an exit visa in 1983.
   In March 1986, Magarik was arrested on his way back to Moscow
from Tbilisi on a domestic flight when airport authorities searched
his luggage and reported finding a cigarette pack containing drugs.
   Magarik said he never saw the pack before, and a blood test
revealed no trace of drugs.
   But he was sentenced in 1986 to three years in prison on charges
of drug trafficking and possession. A year later he was released
after Soviet authorities reviewed his case.
   Magarik's release was attributed to the policy of greater
political openness initiated by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``When I was released from prison I was told that I was the last
of the Prisoners of Zion. But in this great and terrible country,
the Soviet Union, you never can tell who is still being held in
jail,'' Magarik told dozens of friends at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel
Aviv.

   The federal government will seek Supreme Court
review of a ruling that overturned mandatory drug and alcohol
testing for railroad workers, the Justice Department said Wednesday.
   In a 2-1 decision, a federal appeals court in California
declared on Feb. 11 that such testing violates the constitutional
protection against unreasonable search and seizure.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Brown said the government
planned to seek high court review within the next several weeks.
   Brown also said the Justice Department will notify the court
that the government no longer opposes Supreme Court review of
another drug testing case, involving the U.S. Customs Service.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans last year
supported a drug testing program for Customs workers in sensitive
positions such as those involved in drug interdiction. The appeals
court overturned a U.S. District Court decision which had held the
testing to be unconstitutional.
   The Justice Department originally had opposed Supreme Court
review of the Customs Service case because at that time there were
no conflicting decisions from other appeals court circuits.
   The National Treasury Employees Union, which brought the suit
challenging the Customs program, went to the Supreme Court last
summer seeking review.

   Energy Secretary John Herrington was asked
Wednesday to halt rail shipments of radioactive waste from the
Three Mile Island nuclear plant until a new study can be made of
the route by which they are transported.
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., ranking minority member of the Senate
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, made the request in
the wake of an incident involving a TMI train in the St. Louis area
earlier this month.
   Herrington took the senator's request under consideration, a
Danforth aide said.
   The Federal Railroad Administration confirmed on Wednesday it is
investigating a rail car switching incident on Feb. 9 just before a
TMI train passed through St. Louis. The agency is determining
whether there were violations of rail regulations, which could draw
civil penalties of up to $10,000.
   The train was carrying casks of radioactive wastes from the
damaged TMI plant in Pennsylvania to a government laboratory in
Idaho.
   Bill Loftus, an FRA spokesman, said the possible violations
involve mislabeling of a covered hopper car, which was added to the
TMI train in a railyard in East St. Louis, Ill.
   The car carried a placard stating that it contained a flammable
material, but later was found not to be carrying the dangerous
cargo.
   Loftus said the investigation is looking at possible violations
by the rail switching yard, the Union Pacific Railroad which
operated the train after it left the yard and a lime company that
was shipping the car.
   Federal rail regulations, Loftus said, require shippers to
properly label goods being moved by rail. Regulations also prohibit
switching yards from offering mislabeled cars for addition to a
train and railroads from transporting any improperly labeled
freight.
   Herrington met on Wednesday with Danforth and several other
senators from states along the TMI rail route. The Missourian wants
the Energy Department to halt the waste shipments until the
Transportation Department can study the rail route used by the
Energy Department to move the materials to the laboratory in Idaho
Falls, Idaho.
   Since the shipments began in 1986, Missouri officials have
complained that the government's route takes the radioactive
materials through densely populated cities such as St. Louis.

   Amtrak has begun installing smoke detectors
in crew cars as a result of a weekend fire that killed an employee,
a spokeswoman said Wednesday.
   The installation of smoke detectors began Monday in the 15 or so
double-decker cars that serve as crew sleeping quarters on
long-distance trips, Debbie Marciniak said in a telephone interview
from Chicago.
   The move came after a 70-year-old Amtrak employee died of smoke
inhalation from a fire that began early Saturday in the crew car of
a westbound California Zephyr. Nineteen people suffered minor
injuries.
   The fire was discovered as the train pulled into Hastings, about
150 miles west of here, for a scheduled stop.
   Some passengers complained that they were not warned about the
fire, and questioned why there were no smoke detectors on the train.
   Marciniak said the train crew's first priority was to rescue
those in the employee car and evacuate those in a passenger sleeper.
   Amtrak officials said the passengers were in no danger because
the burning crew car and the passenger sleeper were detached from
the coach section of the train.
   Amtrak spokesman John Jacobsen had said commercial smoke
detectors were too sensitive and that the vibration of the trains
would set them off. He said train fires were rare, but that Amtrak
had been looking for a reliable smoke detector.
   Marciniak said Wednesday that the newly installed smoke
detectors may go off as a result of cigarette smoke or dust, but
that the false alarms would be preferable to not having any alarms.
   The railroad also is considering installing smoke detectors in
passenger sleepers, she said.
   Amtrak has been trying to develop a fire and smoke alarm system
for several years, and during the last six months has asked vendors
for assistance, Marciniak said.
   Four companies appear to have a concept that may work and Amtrak
is working with them, she said.
   The state fire marshal's office has blamed the fire on an
electrical short in the crew car.
   Marciniak said Amtrak officials believe the fire may have begun
when boxes of pillows placed next to a heating element in the
luggage storage compartment of the crew car ignited. However,
Amtrak officials are continuing to investigate, she said.
   In the meantime, Marciniak said Amtrak had disconnected all
heating elements in the luggage storage compartments in similar
crew cars. In addition, emergency windows in the dormitory section
of the cars are being expanded, she said.

   A girl was shot and
killed Tuesday and three other people were wounded during an
anti-government demonstration in the town of Azua, Radio Commercial
reported.
   It identified the slain girl as Mary Ramirez, 17, and said she
was shot in the head when protesters clashed with police and
soldiers in Azua, 75 miles west of Santo Domingo, the capital. The
brodadcast said another youth, who was not identified, and two
policemen hit by rocks were treated at hospitals.
   Demonstrators had started their protest Monday, stoning cars and
businesses to demand the government build more public works
projects in the town.
   Demonstrations also were reported Tuesday in two other towns,
both involving claims of pollution by the government-owned Rosario
gold mine north of Santo Domingo.
   In Cotui, 60 miles north of the capital, 500 farmers joined the
Rev. Carlos Guerra in a protest at the town's Roman Catholic
church, according to Radio Popular. It said the rally was held at
the end of a 72-hour general strike by Cotui residents.
   A protest demonstration also was held in Bonao, 50 miles north
of the capital, according to local news reports, but no details
were given.
   President Joaquin Balaguer declined comment on the latest
demonstrations. He said Sunday the disturbances were organized by
political opponents, but no oposition party has identified itself
with the protests.

   An inmate who had called eight killers to
the stand as character witnesses was sentenced a second time
Wednesday to die in the electric chair for the rape-murder of his
13-year-old stepniece.
   Judge Gary Formet said the convicts' statements on behalf of
31-year-old James Hitchcock were believable ``but fall short of
convincing this court'' to spare his life.
   Testifying last week under extraordinary security, the eight
Death Row inmates from Florida State Prison had portrayed Hitchcock
as a model prisoner, a peacemaker, teacher and generous person who
should be spared execution.
   A jury late Saturday recommended by a 7-5 vote that the judge
impose the death penalty.
   Formet was free to set aside the recommendation but cited
Hitchcock's confession, which he later recanted, and agreed with
the prosecution that the 1976 slaying of Cynthia Driggers was
``heinous, atrocious and cruel.''
   Hitchcock's original death sentence was overturned in April by
the U.S. Supreme Court, which ruled the original jury in 1977 had
not considered mitigating evidence of the defendant's character and
background.
   Prosecutors Steve Wallace and Belvin Perry had denigrated the
testimony of the ``eight despicable criminals.''
   ``All these murderers stated their opposition to the death
penalty while seeming oblivious to the fact that each had himself
imposed that ultimate penalty upon innocent victims,'' the
prosecutors said.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo was sworn into
office Thursday and promised to end decades of harsh authoritarian
rule and form a ``people's government.''
   It was the first peaceful transfer of power in South Korea's
violent 40-year history.
   Roh said human rights abuses and government repression would not
be tolerated under the new Sixth Republic and his administration
would swiftly carry out democratic and social reforms.
   ``The day when freedoms and human rights could be slighted in
the name of economic growth and national security has ended. The
day when repressive force and torture in secret chambers were
tolerated is over,'' the 55-year-old Roh said in a tough speech.
   But Roh also warned opposition groups to work with his
government and end the country's long tradition of confrontational
and violent politics. He said he would not tolerate disorder.
   Outgoing President Chun Doo-hwan, whose authoritarian government
crushed opposition and imprisoned and beat dissidents, listened
impassively as Roh criticized past abuses of power and said South
Korea could accept nothing less than full democracy.
   Roh was Chun's hand-picked successor.
   ``There is a strong wind of change blowing over the country,''
Roh said to applause at the heavily guarded ceremony.
   Roh said the new government would ensure full democracy along
with social and economic reforms to aid the poor and other
disadvantaged groups.
   ``I declare that the new administration will be a government of
the people. It will open an era of democracy in which each citizen
can reach his full potential,'' he said.
   Then, in a warning to the opposition, he said, ``The day when
confusion was irresponsibly created on the pretext of freedom and
participation must also come to an end.''
   Thousands of radical students staged demonstrations Wednesday to
protest Roh's inauguration and protesters hurling firebombs and
rocks battled police in Seoul and two other cities.
   It was massive demonstrations led by students last summer that
prompted Chun to agree to democratic reforms. He accepted the
changes after Roh publicly urged him to do so.
   But Roh, a former general, is identified with the
military-backed governments that ruled the country since 1960 and
many Koreans are doubtful he can achieve widespread democratic
change.
   In Washington, an international observer team said Wednesday
that Roh's election appears credible despite some government abuses
during nationwide voting last Dec. 16. The observers, co-sponsored
by the Washington-based International Human Rights Law Group, said
``it appears that the vast majority of the Korean people have
accepted'' Roh's victory.
   Thousands of riot police and security agents guarded Thursday's
ceremony attended by 25,000 invited guests in the square in front
of the National Assembly building under a hazy late winter sky. The
general public was not admitted and the 120,000-man national police
force was on nationwide alert.
   Army and navy bands played, trumpeters blew fanfares and a
traditional Korean folk orchestra in red robes and black horsehair
hats performed.
   Detachments of riot police stood guard in side streets as Roh
rode to the inauguration ceremony.
   About 150 protesters remained Thursday in the compound of the
Roman Catholic Myongdong Cathedral in Seoul after battling riot
police in the surrounding streets during the night.
   Five students armed with bombs and knives briefly seized a U.S.
government building in Seoul and detonated two bombs Wednesday
before being overpowered by police. Nobody was hurt or taken
hostage in the hourlong incident.
   Main streets of Seoul were decorated with the white, red and
blue South Korean national flags and Thursday was declared a
national holiday. Pink and blue arches proclaimed the founding of
the new republic that comes into being with the adoption of a new
constitution.
   Roh told this nation of 41 million people, ``Let us here and now
bury regional antagonism, partisan and factional egoism and
personal resentment.'' Roh won the country's first democratic
presidential election in 16 years on Dec. 16 with 36.6 percent of
the vote. He defeated rival opposition candidates Kim Young-sam and
Kim Dae-jung, who split the opposition vote.
   Opposition parties contend the government will continue to be
run by the armed forces and an entrenched elite of government
officials and business leaders.
   Many Koreans reacted with dismay last week when Roh announced a
new Cabinet that included seven holdovers from the Chun government.
Top security posts went to right-wing hardliners.
   Other Koreans argue Roh must be given time to meet his promises
for major reforms.
   Roh has emphasized the need for political stability and
continued economic expansion as well as democratic reforms. He has
stressed that security must be sufficient to ensure the 1988
Olympic Games are carried out successfully in September.
   Chun stepped down at the end of a seven-year term.

   President Reagan said Wednesday the U.S.
government was constrained from helping black South Africans
fighting the government partly because of divisions among them.
   Reagan was asked at a news conference whether he had considered
aiding the African National Congress or other groups opposing the
Pretoria government since his administration has aided guerrillas
fighting oppression in other countries.
   ``No, we have not involved ourselves in that, other than things
such as the sanctions and so forth,'' Reagan said. ``We have tried
our best to be persuasive in this very difficult problem.''
   He was asked what the difference was between South Africa and
other countries where the United States is supporting ``freedom
fighters.''
   ``The difference is that we don't have an armed insurrection
going as we have in some other countries and we have a great
division even among the people who are being oppressed,'' he said.
``It's a tribal policy more than it is a racial policy and that is
one of the most difficult parts here.''
   Reagan noted that the State Department had contacted the South
African government earlier Wednesday to object to the government's
banning of anti-apartheid organizations.
   ``They should be working toward a multiracial democracy and not
oppressing political organizations there, and we've made our
feelings clear about that,'' he said.
   The State Department had said it was ``appalled'' by South
Africa's decision to ban political activity by the nation's largest
anti-apartheid group and 17 other opposition organizations.
   ``By acting to outlaw non-violent political activity of these
organizations, the South African government has dealt a severe blow
to efforts to achieve a a peaceful solution to South Africa's
problems,'' State Department spokesman Charles Redman said.
   He said the affected organizations represent the aspirations of
a broad cross section of the black community.
   ``We are appalled by the announcement from the South African
government today that it is effectively outlawing the activities of
a large number of organizations,'' Redman said, adding: ``This is a
giant step backward for South Africa.''
   Redman said Assistant Secretary of State Chester Crocker had
summoned South Africa's ambassador to the State Department to
register ``shock and distress'' over the crackdown.

   A federal appeals court Wednesday night
granted a stay of execution to a man scheduled to die early
Thursday for a murder committed at age 17.
   A three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit of Appeals in New
Orleans, in granting the indefinite stay, said it needed more time
to study the case of 24-year-old Gary Graham. Earlier Wednesday, a
federal judge in Houston denied a stay.
   The stay came hours before Graham was scheduled to die by
injection for the 1981 shooting death of Bobby Grant Lambert, 53,
of Tucson, Ariz., in a Houston grocery store parking lot.
   Lambert was robbed of less than $100, although police said the
victim had $6,000 on him.
   Defense attorney Doug O'Brien had asked for a stay pending a
decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in an Oklahoma case contending
that people who commit crimes when under the age of 18 should not
be executed.
   His appeal also was based on a Texas case contending jurors
should be allowed to hear mitigating circumstances when considering
punishment. Arguments in that case are scheduled before the U.S.
Supreme Court on March 1.
   Five other Texas death row inmates have execution dates this
year.
   Twenty-seven people have been executed in Texas, more than in
any other state, since the Supreme Court allowed states to resume
use of the death penalty in 1976.

   Church bells rang Thursday and
thousands of Filipinos joined hands in a ``chain for peace'' to
mark the second anniversary of the ouster of Ferdinand Marcos.
   President Corazon Aquino clasped the hands of Defense Secretary
Fidel Ramos and Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa on Epifanio de
los Santos Avenue.
   It was along the broad avenue, known popularly as EDSA, that
hundreds of thousands of civilians rallied to support military
mutineers in the uprising that forced the former president from the
country on Feb. 25, 1986.
   As church bells pealed Thursday, a Philippine air force T-28
swooped low over the crowd dragging a banner reading ``People
Power.'' Police estimated that by 8:30 a.m. (7:30 p.m. Wednesday
EST) about 20,000 people had packed the avenue for the all-day
celebrations.
   Leftists scheduled their own rallies Thursday at which they
planned to accuse Mrs. Aquino of abandoning the reformist goals of
the 1986 revolution. On Wednesday, about 20,000 people marched
along the boulevard and burned an effigy of Mrs. Aquino.
   During celebrations Thursday, armored personnel carriers carried
images of the Virgin Mary in a procession along Epifanio avenue.
Officials said the images were the ones carried by priests and nuns
during the 1986 revolt.
   Roman Catholic Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, archbishop of Manila, said
in a radio broadcast that the celebrations showed ``we want
brotherhood and not bloodshed.''
   In 1986, Sin called on Filipinos to fill the streets to support
mutineers led by Ramos and former Defense Minister Juan Ponce
Enrile.
   They had broken with Marcos, charging him with fraud in the Feb.
7, 1986, presidential election in which he ran against Mrs. Aquino.
The rebels' action galvanized the opposition that began after the
1983 assassination of opposition leader Benigno Aquino, Mrs.
Aquino's husband.
   Marcos fled to Hawaii.
   During a leftist protest Wednesday, about 200 police officers
blocked the road leading to the military's Camp Crame in suburban
Quezon City as helicopters hovered above. The crowd of students,
workers, farmers and Roman Catholic clergy dispersed without
incident after three hours of anti-government speeches.
   The leftist protesters chanted ``dismantle the U.S.-Aquino
regime'' and burned effigies of Mrs. Aquino. Red banners said
``Advance the People's Genuine Revolution'' and one poster read:
``Cory _ Closet Dictator.''
   ``We had high hopes when Cory Aquino said she would be the exact
opposite of Marcos. But after two years, we have no more hope that
she will fulfill her promises,'' Crispin Beltran, head of the
militant May First Movement labor organization, told the rally.
   People distributed leaflets of the outlawed National Democractic
Front, the umbrella organization of 12 Marxist groups including the
Communist Party and its armed wing, the New People's Army.
   ``The Aquino government has betrayed the Filipino people's hope
for fundamental changes in society after ousting Marcos...,'' the
Democratic Front statement said.
   Also Wednesday, Mrs. Aquino denied charges by the wife of a
discredited navy officer that Ramos was involved in a November 1986
coup attempt.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, General Ramos has proven himself not
only now but in the past, especially in his abiding by the
constitution,'' she told reporters. ``He has not been any part of
any coup attempt.''
   Ramos also denied the charges by Marilyn Robles, wife of Capt.
Rex Robles.
   The plot involved killing leftist officials, installing a
military junta and reducing Mrs. Aquino to the role of a figurehead.

   Foreign ministers of eight Latin
American countries opened a conference Wednesday at which they will
consider calling for the readmission of Cuba to the Organization of
American States.
   The foreign ministers of Peru, Panama, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico,
Uruguay, Venezuela and Argentina are scheduled to meet for three
days in the Colombian port city of Cartagena.
   Also on the agenda are peace efforts in Central America, British
naval drills near the Falklands, the region's $400 billion foreign
debt and increased policing of drug trafficking, said Esther Lozano
de Rey, chief secretary for the Colombian Foreign Ministry.
   The ministers make up what is called the Group of Eight,
organized last year mainly to monitor the situation in Central
America.
   Mrs. Lozano de Rey told The Associated Press that a preliminary
agenda for the Group of Eight meeting, drawn up by assistants to
the foreign ministers, included a proposal to support Cuba's
re-entry into the OAS.
   Cuba was expelled from the organization in 1962, three years
after Fidel Castro came to power.
   In a meeting of the eight Latin American countries' presidents
last November in Acapulco, Mexico, President Jose Sarney of Brazil
told reporters that the leaders had agreed that the communist
nation should be readmitted to the OAS. However, such a statement
was not included in a final document from the meeting.
   The U.S. State Department has said the United States can not
support the readmission of Cuba to the OAS until that country stops
trying to subvert democratic rule in the hemisphere.
   At the Cartagena meeting, the Latin American ministers are
considering calling for an end to the British naval maneuvers that
have taken place around the Falklands Islands in the south Atlantic
since the 1982 war between Argentina and Britain, according to Ms.
Lozano de Rey.
   Argentina invaded the islands, which it calls the Malvinas, but
later surrendered to the British.
   The ministers planned to discuss a statement urging wealthy
countries to fight consumption of cocaine and calling on the eight
Latin American countries to work to cut production of the drug.
   Colombia, Peru and Bolivia are South America's three biggest
cocaine-producing countries.
   Panama's foreign minister, Jorge Abadia, said Wednesday his
government is not discounting the possibility of U.S. military
intervention in Panama because of the indictment on drug
trafficking charges of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, head of
Panama's armed forces.
   If there is an invasion, ``we won't have the capacity to stop
it,'' Abadia said.
   The Reagan administration publicly called for Noriega to step
down following his indictment this month by a federal grand jury in
Miami.
   Abadia said the charges do not constitute an attack on Noriega
but on the Panamanian military. He claimed the charges are an
attempt to break the treaty under which the United States has
promised to turn the Panama Canal to Panama by the year 2000.
   When the meeting ends, the eight foreign ministers will head for
Hamburg, West Germany for a series of meetings with Central
American officials on the situation in their region.

<TEXT>
   Republican presidential candidate Pat
Robertson said Wednesday his Christian Broadcasting Network once
knew the whereabouts of American hostages in Lebanon ``and they
could have been freed'' but President Reagan said if that were so
``he kept it to himself.''
   Robertson's comments came at an Atlanta news conference during
which he complained that U.S. intelligence in the Middle East is
inadequate and declared that action must be quick when Americans
are taken hostage.
   A Robertson aide said later that the former television
evangelist was referring to passengers who had been taken hostage
by hijackers of a TWA flight in the Middle East.
   ``We identified in our news department at CBN the location of
those hostages in Lebanon very shortly after they were taken, and
they were in a position where they could have been rescued,''
Robertson said.
   ``They were in Beirut, and they could have been freed.''
   Robertson did not provide specifics and did not say which
hostages were involved.
   Reagan, at a nationally broadcast news conference, responded to
Robertson's claim.
   ``It'd be very strange if he actually did have information as to
the location of those hostages,'' said the president. ``Isn't it
strange that no one in our administration was ever apprised of
that?''
   ``If he thought that he knew,'' the president said of Robertson,
``he kept it to himself.''
   Reagan added that ``we have tried our best and through every
kind of channel to establish their (the hostages') whereabouts
because that's the beginning of efforts to try and get them free.''
   ``It's very frustrating to try and establish a location,''
Reagan said. ``But we've never let up, and we never will, in trying
to obtain the freedom of all the hostages.''
   After Reagan spoke, Robertson's deputy press secretary, Scott
Hatch, said: ``I think what Pat said was accurate.''
   Benton Miller, spokesman for CBN, based in Virginia Beach, Va.,
later issued a synopsis of the news report to which Robertson
referred. He said it involved hostages who had been taken from TWA
Flight 847.
   The synopsis said that in response to a question from Robertson,
a CBN Middle East correspondent, who was not named, said the
hostages, ``are in several locations in and around Lebanon and we
have also learned that maybe at least one of them, and we do not
know which one, but we have been told by intelligence sources in
Lebanon, that at least one may be being held in Tehran.''
   The suspicion concerning the hostage thought to be held in
Tehran was later reported as incorrect in a subsequent news report
on Robertson's ``700 Club'' talk show, Miller said.
   Asked whether he had told the Reagan administration what he
knew, the former television evangelist said, ``I broadcast it on
national television; they monitor our programs virtually every
day.''
   Later, in an interview on Atlanta radio station WGST, Robertson
said the information about the hostages was obtained by a
CBN-affiliated TV station in Lebanon. ``My reporters in Lebanon had
information, initially, on where these hostages were taken,'' he
said.
   Robertson said that was ``several years ago, when the first
hostages were taken.''
   Rival Republican candidate Jack Kemp called Robertson's
statements irresponsible and said he should ``apologize to the
families of the hostages whom he has needlessly hurt in an attempt
to gain publicity.''
   Vice President George Bush, campaigning in Boston, was asked
about Robertson's statements. ``My question would be, how come he
didn't get hold of the proper authorities in the United States
government that were working day and night, trying to figure out
how they could get these people out?''
   In his news conference, Robertson said action to rescue hostages
``has to be quick and it has to be a surprise, that once the
situation has hardened, six months have gone by, eight months, a
year, it's virtually impossible to get any movement because the
hostages are dispersed and the captors are more or less dug in.''
   Robertson aide Gary Lane told The Associated Press that in 1985,
``during the TWA Flight 847 crisis,'' CBN Beirut Bureau Chief Gus
Hashem ``had information from sources where the hostages were being
held in West Beirut and who was holding them.''
   Lane said the State Department contacted CBN for information at
that time, but he said he did not know exactly who made the contact.
   A State Department terrorism expert said he was puzzled by the
contention.
   The official, who commented only on condition of remaining
anonymous, said he was unaware that CBN ever broadcast the precise
locations of any hostages. He also said knowledge of hostages'
whereabouts in terms of a particular city or even a section of a
city wouldn't be enough to mount a rescue mission.
   Nine Americans are in captivity in Lebanon, including Marine Lt.
Col. William R. Higgins, who was captured last week. Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
is the longest-held captive, having been kidnapped on March 16,
1985.
   Robertson's comments on the hostages marked the second time in
two weeks that his statements on international matters have sparked
controversy. During a Republican presidential debate on Feb. 14, he
alleged that the Soviets have nuclear missiles in Cuba, pointing to
the United States. The Reagan administration denied it.
   In yet another controversy, Bush asked Robertson to apologize or
provide proof to back up his suggestion on Tuesday that
anti-Robertson political motivations were behind the timing of
public allegations of sexual misconduct against television
evangelist Jimmy Swaggart.
   ``By sundown in the old South, I'd like to see him stand up like
a Southern gentleman with a little evidence,'' Bush said. ``I'd
like to see an apology or proof.''

<HEAD>Federal Agents Make Arrests in Wildlife Sting</HEAD>

   Federal agents Wednesday arrested 17 people,
most of them in Virginia, and were looking for seven more in the
windup of a four-year sting operation aimed at illegal bear hunting.
   Nineteen search warrants were executed in 12 states and trophies
and animal parts were seized at some locations. Five airplanes were
seized at Anchorage, Alaska, but no arrests were made there.
   Clark R. Bavin, chief of law enforcement for the Fish and
Wildlife Service, said at a news conference, ``We may have 30 to 35
people charged eventually.''
   Arrest warrants were obtained for two people in Maryland, one in
Montana, four in North Carolina, four in West Virginia and 11 in
Virginia, a total of 22. Twelve people in fact were arrested in
Virginia and an additional suspect was being sought, but officials
in Washington did not immediately know where.
   Agents established a kind of hunters' brokerage in Purcellville,
Va., about 50 miles from Washington, that arranged hunts for
customers, bringing guides and hunters together.
   Bavin said the company, Abrams Creek Outfitters, spent a year
establishing its cover through advertisments, attendance of
employees at conventions and visits to guides.
   The investigation began with a focus on out-of-season and
airborne hunting of caribou and brown bears in Alaska, but grew to
include illegal killing of black bears, frequently in and near
Shenandoah National Park in Virginia, and sale of bear parts.
   Bavin displayed a mounted, stuffed bear he said was taken in
Alaska by a two-plane party that landed the hunters at a makeshift
camp to kill the bear as it was driven toward them by the other
airplane.
   ``This is totally illegal,'' he said.
   Appearing with federal officials at the news conference, Gerald
Simmons, chief of law enforcement for the Virginia Game and Inland
Fisheries Commission, said, ``Virginia was delighted to take part''
because it appeared that as many as 200 black bears were killed
illegally last year out of a population of 2,000 to 2,500. In legal
hunting, 557 bears were killed in the state.
   Simmons and Bavin displayed about a dozen bear gall bladders,
wrapped in plastic bags, that had been seized in one arrest earlier
in the day. These organs are considered valuable medicine in the
Far East and may bring $300 each.
   In addition, hides brought up to $250 each.
   The forest-dwelling black bear was found in 49 states 200 years
ago, but practically decimated by the early part of this century.
Conservation programs have restored the bear to 30 states, and
hunting is often permitted.
   Federal law makes it a crime to transport across state lines
widlife taken in violation of state law. That statute says
violations can bring a year in prison and a $10,000 fine unless a
sale across state lines is involved, in which case the term may be
five years and the fine $20,000. Under a 1984 law, the fine may be
multiplied to $250,000.
   A 1971 law makes it a federal crime to shoot or harass wildlife
from aircraft, with penalties specified as a possible yearlong
prison term and fine of $5,000. The 1984 statute makes it possible
to multiply the fine to $100,000.

   President Reagan said Wednesday night ``we've
never let up and we never will'' in efforts to free the American
hostages in Lebanon, adding that if Republican presidential
candidate Pat Robertson knew of their whereabouts, it was ``very
strange'' that ``he kept it to himself.''
   In his first full-dress news conference in four months, Reagan
also said he thought outside terrorists had been at work stirring
up the Middle East violence on the West Bank that has prompted an
Israeli military crackdown.
   The president said he had ``every confidence'' in the personal
integrity of embattled Attorney General Edwin Meese III. But said
he could not comment on reports of the investigation of Meese's
role in a proposed Middle East oil pipeline.
   As is his custom, Reagan opened the nationally televised session
in the White House East Room with a quip. ``On the networks at
last,'' he said in a wry reference to the refusal by CBS, NBC and
ABC to carry his prime-time Feb. 2 speech on the eve of a House
vote on aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   The news conference blended international affairs with the
domestic presidential campaign swirling outside the White House
gates, and Reagan showed his zest for political combat with a few
jabs at the field of Democratic contenders.
   To hear them, he said, ``we're in an economic slump'' suffering
from a variety of ills. ``At the moment none of those things are
true,'' he said.
   ``So I just think, you know, the kids will play,'' he said as
laughter filled the room.
   The president also confirmed anew that Vice President George
Bush expressed reservations during the Iran-Contra affair. But he
refused to say precisely what Bush had told him.
   On other topics, Reagan:
   _Said Secretary of State George Shultz had given him an
``encouraging'' report on his just-completed trip to the Soviet
Union. During the talks in Moscow, Shultz and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze set a one-month deadline for arms
negotiators to complete drafts on key elements of a new treaty to
curb strategic nuclear weapons.
   _Noted that Shultz was embarking on a fresh peace-seeking
mission to the Middle East, and said he hoped Israelis and Arabs
would ``rid themselves of old ideas and stances that cannot work''
and begin serious negotiations.
   _Issued a fresh condemnation of the leftist Sandinista
government of Nicaragua, and said the Soviet Union had doubled
military assistance to the nation in the first two months of this
year over 1987 levels. He provided no figures.
   _Said he had not decided whether to tell Congress that aid
should be resumed to Panama. He has to certify that Panama is
helping in anti-drug efforts, but Gen. Manuel Noriega, Panama's
military leader, has been indicted on U.S. drug-trafficking charges.
   Reagan passed up several invitations to criticize Israeli action
against Arab protesters on the occipied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``We don't support that sort of thing,'' was as strong a
statement as the president would make, but he added quickly that
there was evidence that the riots that provoked an Israeli military
crackdown were not ``spontaneous.''
   Asked to elaborate, he said, ``We have had information that
there have been certain people suspected of being terrorists,
outsiders coming in and stirring up the trouble in those areas.''
   He ducked a request for more information, replying that to say
more would ``get into areas that violate security.''
   The subject of Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson _
nearly three years in captivity _ and the other American hostages
in Lebanon arose early in the 30-minute nationally televised
question-and-answer session.
   ``We've never let up and we never will in trying to bring
freedom for all our hostages,'' Reagan said.
   Asked about GOP candidate Robertson's claim that his Christian
Broadcasting Network had once known the location of some of the
hostages and the administration may have missed a chance for a
rescue, the president said:
   ``I can only say this. It would be very strange if he did have
information ... isn't it strange that no one in our administration
was apprised of it.''
   Reagan said he didn't want to become involved in the campaign to
succeed him in the White House, but he said, ``If he felt that he
(Robertson) knew he kept it to himself.''
   The president's statement on the Contras seemed to be a soft
appeal for support in Congress for fresh aid to the rebels. He
noted with regret that the Democratic-run House had rejected his
call for $36.2 million in fresh aid to the Contra, including some
money for weapons.
   House leaders have scheduled a vote for next week on an
alternative support calling for humanitarian aid.
   Reagan was unclear on a number of points. For example, he said
that Soviet membershin||nt on Tariffs and Trade, is under review but he
failed to point out that the United States strenuously opposes
Soviet participation.
   He also said that Secretary of State George Shultz and former
Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger did not object to the secret
sale of arms to Iran on grounds that it was a trade of arms for
hostages. However, the secretaries have said otherwise, and the
Iran-Contra report issued by two congressional committees said
Shultz and Weinberger ``called it a straight arms-for-hostages deal
that was contrary to U.S. public policy.''
   Reagan jockeyed a busy round of talks on foreign policy problems
Wednesday with last-minute preparations for the news conference,
the 42nd in his seven years as president but his first since last
Oct. 22.
   His first appointment Wednesday was with Shultz, who returned
from Moscow on Tuesday night after talks on arms control and the
likelihood of a Soviet pullout of military forces from Afghanistan.
   Shultz headed out again Wednesday night, this time to the Middle
East to try to spark Arab-Israeli peace talks. Shultz said in
advance he had only a slim chance of succeeding, and that the two
sides would have to moderate their ``extreme positions.''
   During the talks in Moscow, Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze set a one-month deadline for arms negotiators
to complete drafts on key elements of a new treaty to curb
strategic nuclear weapons.

<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic prelate of Guatemala
offered Wednesday to mediate peace talks between the government of
President Vinicio Cerezo and leftist guerrillas who have waged a
sporadic war since 1960.
   Monsignor Prospero Penados del Barrio told reporters he accepted
a request to act as mediator from the general command of the
Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union, which is made up of three
leftist armies.
   There was no immediate comment from the president's office.
   The archbishop told at a news conference, ``We would carry out
our mediation at any place, whether it be proposed by the
guerrillas or by the government, since the important thing is to
end the fratricidal fight that ... has served to blind useful
lives.''
   He said the first round of talks should be held before Holy Week
at the end of March.
   The talks would be held in accordance with a Central American
peace plan signed last August by the presidents of Guatemala,
Nicaragua, El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica.
   Asked about the talks, Defense Minister Gen. Hector Alejandro
Gramajo Morales said the army ``is very close to achieving a total
victory'' over the rebels.
   ``In a very short time,'' he said, ``the subversive activity in
the country will be ended.''
   He said the guerrillas number 500 to 700.
   Last October, representatives of the government and the
guerrillas met for the first time since the rebels took to the
hills in 1960 after a failed coup attempt. Their four-day talks
were held in Madrid, Spain.
   The talks foundered over the role of the army, how to interpret
the term ``cease-fire,'' and rebel concern over whether the
government can control rightist death squads.
   Foreign Minister Alfonso Cabrera said then that further peace
talks would be pointless and called on the rebels to ``become part
of the country's political and productive framework once again.''
   The request to the archbishop to negotiate new talks was made by
leaders of the three rebel armies in the Revolutionary Union _
Rolando Moran of the Guerrilla Army of the Poor; Gaspar Ilom, a
pseudonym for Rodrigo Asturias, of the Organization of People in
Arms and Pablo Monsanto of the Rebel Armed Forces.
   In ads in local newspapers, the guerrillas said a dialogue with
the government ``is the only way to avoid death and suffering.''
   Gramajo Morales, the defense minister, said the rebels should
put down their arms and rejoin public life before any talks are
undertaken. He said Guatemala was complying fully with the new
peace plan.
   The plan calls for cease-fire talks between the government and
rebels in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua as a first step
toward democratic elections. It also urges political amnesties and
a ban on all outside military assistance to rebel groups.
   Right-wing death squads have operated for the past decade in
Guatemala, kidnapping and killing labor leaders, suspected
communist leaders and human rights activists.

   An IRA bomb exploded in central
Belfast late Wednesday night, killing two part-time soldiers of the
Ulster Defense Regiment and wounding two others and a civilian
pedestrian, police said.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility in a telephoned
statement to Belfast news organizations.
   Belfast police headquarters said in a statement that the
explosion occurred at security gates in Royal Avenue.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said the blast was heard more
than 12 miles away. Police estimated the size of the bomb at 150
pounds. The explosion shattered shop and office windows hundreds of
yards away.
   The police statement said the four soldiers were on patrol in a
Land Rover. It said police believe the bomb was hidden behind an
advertising billboard fronting a building site.
   Police earlier said they believed the bomb was thrown by hand
but later amended this, saying they thought the bombers detonated
it from some distance away using a control wire.
   The vehicle was stationary at the time. One soldier died almost
instantly. The other died later in Belfast City Hospital, police
said.
   They said a 57-year-old pedestrian passing by was slightly hurt.
The army said the two wounded soldiers received only minor injuries.
   Chief Inspector Jim Boyd of Belfast police said the attack
occurred about 11 p.m. when few people were around.
   The locally recruited Ulster Defense Regiment is part of the
British army.
   Wednesday's death brings to at least 2,628 Northern Ireland's
overall toll since sectarian and political violence flared in 1969.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA wants to drive the British from
Northern Ireland and unite the predominantly Protestant province
with the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic under socialist
rule.
   Earlier Wednesday, police charged an 18-year-old British soldier
with unlawfully killing an unarmed Roman Catholic civilian.
   A magistrate in Cookstown, 25 miles west of Belfast, ordered
Pvt. David Jonathan Holden held in police custody until his
appearance at a Belfast court on March 9.
   The defense said Holden will plead innocent to the charge of
unlawfully killing Aidan McAnespie, 23. He was hit Sunday by a
bullet fired from an army observation post at a checkpoint near
Auchnacloy, half a mile from the Irish Republic's border.
   The Irish government angered Britain by launching its own police
investigation.
   Anglo-Irish relations have also been strained by Britain's
refusal to prosecute police officers involved in shooting to death
six unarmed Catholics in 1982.
   British and Irish leaders Wednesday held their first meeting
since October under the auspices of the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement,
which gave Ireland an advisory role in Northern Ireland affairs in
an effort to redress grievances of the Catholic minority.
   Ireland's foreign affairs minister, Brian Lenihan, met with
Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King, the top British official in
the province. After the meeting, King said they had arranged for
their police chiefs to meet next month to discuss security
cooperation along the border.
   But the Irish government later denied that the two sides agreed
on such a meeting.
   A joint communique issued after Wednesday's talks focused on
proposed British legislation aimed at guaranteeing a fair division
of employment between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland.
   Meanwhile, police in Dublin said they had uncovered a cache of
weapons, including 30 Soviet-made Kalashnikov semi-automatic
rifles, in a makeshift bunker beaneath a shed at Malahide in the
city's northern outskirts.
   Police, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the weapons
apparently were destined for the IRA and may have been part of four
shipments they believe were smuggled from Libya into Ireland over
the last three years.
   The cache included a dozen rocket warheads, 64 hand grenades,
30,000 bullets and 500 pounds of explosives.

   President Reagan said Wednesday night the
administration has information that suspected terrorists from the
outside have been stirring up trouble in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Reagan made his statement in a nationally televised news
conference as Secretary of State George P. Shultz headed for the
Middle East with admittedly little chance of setting up
Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   Reporting on Shultz' mission, Reagan said, ``In the Middle East,
it's time for all parties to rid themselves of old ideas and
stances that cannot work and to begin a serious process of
negotiation and reconciliation.''
   He was not specific, however, and he passed up several
invitations to criticize Israeli action against Arab protesters in
the occupied territories.
   ``We have spoken to the government there and we have also spoken
to the Palestinian leadership because there is every evidence that
these riots are not just spontaneous and home grown,'' the
president said.
   Asked about the Israeli actions against Palestinian protesters,
Reagan said, ``We don't support that sort of thing and we are
trying to persuade all the participants to try to arrive at a
solution representing justice for all.''
   When he was asked to whom he was referring in his statement
about the riots not being ``home grown,'' the president responded,
``We have had information that there have been certain people
suspected of being terrorists, outsiders coming in, not only with
weapons, but stirring up and encouraging the trouble in those
areas.''
   ``Now, that isn't something you can go out and say we absolutely
know, but certainly the violence is both ways,'' the president said.
   He said he could not be more specific ``because I get into areas
there that would be violating security rules, and I don't think I
should.''
   On a related subject, Reagan was asked about reports out of
Geneva that Palestinian Liberation Organization leader Yasser
Arafat might be willing to accept two United Nations resolutions,
which he has scorned in the past and which are the cornerstone of
U.S. policy in the Mideast.
   ``Well, I know that this is one other thing we're pursuing,''
the president said. ``If he really is, and if he is willing to
acknowledge the right of Israel to exist as a nation ... I'm sure
that the secretary of state will be _ is apprised of that fact, and
will see what we can do there.''
   Reagan said his administration would continue to seek ways to
alleviate Israeli-Arab conflict.
   ``That's a goal that I think would ... be one of the greatest
achievements of this administration, if before I leave, we could
bring about a peace in the Middle East,'' he said.
   Before departing for Jerusalem, Shultz added Syria to his
itinerary despite U.S. sanctions against a country the State
Department has condemned as a supporter of terrorism.
   ``When we have an issue to address we're going to address it in
the most effective way we can,'' department spokesman Charles E.
Redman said. He called Syria ``one of the key players in the
region.''
   Sources in Damascus said Shultz would visit on Saturday. Redman
refused to provide a specific itinerary, saying only that Shultz
would make stops in Israel, Jordan, Egypt and Syria, and that he
``was ready to meet with Palestinians.''
   He will remain in the region until next Tuesday when he flies to
London to see King Hussein of Jordan, who is in the British capital
for dental work, and then to Brussels for a summit meeting of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Shultz is leaving his schedule open for a return to the Middle
East next Thursday for a few more days of diplomacy before
returning to Washington on March 6.
   Shultz rates his chances of setting up negotiations as slim, and
said succcess would depend on the Israelis and Arabs moderating
their ``extree positions.''
   At a news conference Tuesday in Brussels, he said ``it's just
possible attitudes have shifted enough.''
   ``Looking forward to it?'' Shultz joshed. ``It's going to be
tough.''
   The U.S. goal is to find a way for Israel and a mixed delegation
of Jordanians and Palestinians to hold negotiations to lower
tensions on the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza.
   Temporary self-rule for the 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs who
live under Israeli control is the short-term aim. Negotiations by
December that leave open the option of a state linked to Jordan is
the projected second step.
   This would mean Israel's surrendering most of the territory it
gained from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Six-Day war. Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir and his Likud bloc do not accept the State
Department's concept of ``trading territory for peace,'' while
Hussein refuses to commit himself to negotiations with an uncertain
outcome.
   The Palestinians, meanwhile, are divided about their objectives
and unable to agree on who would represent them in negotiations.
   ``I don't think many people give me much chance,'' Shultz said
in Brussels. He said he found ``intense skepticism'' even among the
NATO allies.
   ``However,'' he said, ``we do have a few ideas. The engagement
of the United States on an intense basis is welcomed. I believe
that even if the chances are small it's worthwhile trying, and you
can't be too afraid of failing.''
   Shultz will have some good news for Mubarak. A U.S. official
said Wednesday the State Department will notify Congress it plans
to go ahead with a $2 billion, 10-year project to produce M-1 tanks
jointly with Egypt.
   The official, who demanded anonymity, said the project would
involve the first foreign purchase of the top-of-the-line U.S.
tanks. It will be financed from the $1.3 billion in grants that
Egypt receives annually from the United States.
   Shultz returned to Washington Tuesday night to report to
President Reagan on his two days of talks in Moscow. He also met
with visiting Portugese Prime Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva and
spoke to a meeting of the Business Council.
   Ten years ago, the United States, Israel and Egypt produced the
Camp David agreements. This led in 1979 to a peace treaty between
Israel and Egypt and to unsuccessful negotiations over Palestinian
``autonomy,'' or limited self-rule.
   As Shultz weighed a trip to the region this month, many Arab
countries led by Egypt and Jordan informed the United States that
they firmly rejected another interim negotiation based on Camp
David.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who heads the only Arab
country formally to make peace with Israel, called the Camp David
formula ``a thing of the past whose time has ended.''

   West Bank villagers burned the home of a fellow
Arab accused of helping the Israelis and lynched him after he fired
on a crowd Wednesday with a submachine gun, killing a 4-year-old
boy and wounding 13 people, security sources said.
   Israel radio called the event ``a serious escalation'' of 11
weeks of violence in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
linked it to calls by the Palestine Liberation Organization for
harsh action against collaborators.
   Palestinians began a general strike in the occupied territories
Wednesday and the army reported the first attack on Israeli
soldiers with explosives and firearms since riots began Dec. 8.

   The government on Wednesday
banned political activity by 18 opposition groups, including the
nation's largest anti-apartheid organization and its biggest union
federation, in the most sweeping crackdown in a decade.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said the move would be seen by
many government opponents as a ``declaration of war.''
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, however, said the
regulations ``will contribute to a climate of stability, peaceful

   The Supreme Court expanded significantly the
legal protections for parody and satire Wednesday as it overturned
a $200,000 award evangelist Jerry Falwell had won against Hustler
magazine and publisher Larry Flynt.
   The justices ruled unanimously that ``emotional distress''
lawsuits filed by public figures targeted by such spoofs should be
as difficult to win as libel suits. And the court unanimously said
that even pornographic spoofs enjoy the free-speech protection of
the Constitution's First Amendment.

   Republican presidential candidate Pat Robertson
said Wednesday that his Christian Broadcasting Network once knew
the whereabouts of American hostages in Lebanon ``and they could
have been freed.''
   Told of Robertson's statement, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater asked, ``Why didn't he tell us where they were?''
   Robertson's comments came at an Atlanta news conference during
which he complained that U.S. intelligence in the Middle East is
inadequate and declared that action must be quick when Americans
are taken hostage.
   ``We identified in our news department at CBN the location of
those hostages in Lebanon very shortly after they were taken, and
they were in a position where they could have been rescued. They
were in Beirut, and they could have been freed,'' said Robertson,
who did not provide specifics and did not say which hostages were
involved.

   As many as 460 Americans may get AIDS infections
each year from transfusions of tainted blood that slip through
blood-bank screening programs, according to a new federal estimate.
   A study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control concludes that
there is ``a remote but real risk'' of infection with the AIDS
virus when people get transfusions of blood that has been checked
for the virus.
   The researchers calculate that the odds are about 1 in 40,000
that a blood transfusion will contain the AIDS virus.

<HEAD>Second Scandal In Row Leaves Denomination Stunned, Questioning</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lively Pentecostal denomination, shattered by
the successive shaming of its two most dazzling TV evangelists,
this week was in a state of trauma.
   Some of its leaders were questioning the propriety of television
preaching itself.
   ``There's a great deal of sadness, shock and grief over the
whole situation,'' said Juleen Turnage, communications officer for
the Assemblies of God, based in Springfield, Mo.
   ``We're back in the shades of 1987,'' she added, referring to
when the sexual lapses struck in the case of ex-TV star Jim Bakker,
and now had hit fiery TV preacher Jimmy Swaggart.
   ``It's a tremendous shock, so totally out of character with what
he preached,'' said the Rev. Robert Spence, president of the
denomination's Evangel College.
   ``It's going to have a very, very serious effect on those
ministries that are still on television. The element of suspicion
of it is going to become even more acute.''
   Some think that may be a good idea. Clinical psychologist Larry
Bass, a denominational member, says there is ``something corrupting
about the power'' of dominating huge crowds.
   ``There's a kind of narcissistic evil that attracts people to
that kind of work, all the self-aggrandizement it gives them. TV
gives it even larger magnitude.''
   He suggests local congregations should teach people to be more
critical in viewing TV preachers and particularly to guard against
these dangerous tendencies:
   _``Putting anyone up on a pedestal, or believing they're
virtually the voice of God.
   _``Ministers who put down other religions and people and who are
extremely judgmental about the faults of others.''
   He said Swaggart seemed to fit these categories, almost
mesmerizing crowds with his sizzling, emotional fervor and his
blistering attacks on other religions and on other people's sexual
flaws.
   ``Nobody has all the answers, and for anyone to act as if they
do is a big danger sign,'' Bass said. Noting that Swaggart
sometimes said anyone who disagreed with him was wrong, Bass added:
   ``Anyone who sets himself up with that kind of authority, that
he's always absolutely correct, is a dangerous thing, and hardly to
be trusted.''
   However, he said ``it's unfortunately true'' that the typical
kind of followers Swaggart attracts ``are the most gullible.''
   Religion Professor Stanley M. Burgess, an Assemblies scholar of
Southwestern Missouri State University in Springfield, said the
fall of such high-powered evangelists as Swaggart serves this clear
warning:
   ``We must be careful not to label as gold everything that
glitters.''
   Such celebrated preachers ``still have feet of clay,'' Burgess
said. ``People have to show greater discernment about them,
recognizing that we're not dealing with God here but humans who can
fall.''
   Even in the scandals, he said, ``I would hope people will not
drool over it, but learn from it, and look for a silver lining.''
   For one thing, he added, ``people who have supported TV
ministries may now put their support back in local churches and
synagogues, where it has been missing in many cases.''
   A noted church communications expert, the Rev. William F. Fore,
maintains that religion, when it buys into television, is co-opted
by it and becomes a victim to its focus on self-gratification and
quick-fix answers.
   It ``maximizes self-interest,'' he said in his recent book,
``Television and Religion,'' grossly twisting the biblical emphasis
on selfless service.
   ``This corruption of the fundamental biblical concept of
conscience into self-interest is perhaps the most serious of all
the electronic church's distortions.''
   Spence said there is ``nothing wrong'' with the medium of
television itself, but that it does involve detachment from the
local congregation, ``where there is a greater degree of
accountability.''
   ``In television, there's not that closeness, of a minister
living among his people,'' Spence said.
   Furthermore, he added, other aspects of TV raise the
``posibility of distortion,'' such as TV's continual concern of
``what it will look like,'' and how a ``program will go over'' with
a mass, theologically uninformed audience.
   He said that when someone in that situation has been very
successful, there's a tendency ``to live in an unreal world, filled
only with people who are saying what they think he wants to hear.
   ``It's an artificial environment that distorts the whole
perspective and can lead to a point of assuming you're stronger
than you really are ... that `what might bother other people does
not affect me'.''
   But despite the deflecting aspects, he said, ``a person has to
be of the compromising type to cross over the line'' in his morals,
something Swaggart was ``definitely not'' in his words. His conduct
turned out to be something else.
   That, Spence said, ``is part of the tremendous shock.''
   The Rev. Richard Champion, editor of the denomination's weekly,
Pentecostal Evangel, said church leaders ``are going through a
personal trauma. Here was this brother in Christ, and suddenly this
happens, and we have to deal with the fallout.''

<HEAD>Age of Corporate Chiefs Is Falling</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   People who attempt to determine just what is
going on in the executive suite are eyeing a vital statistic that
appears to have changed direction again:
   The average age at which chief executive officers are appointed
to lead top corporations is declining again after a fairly steady
rise since the mid- and late 1960s.
   The changing numbers are likely to prompt a spate of
explanations, along with interpretations about the consequences for
management and the economy. But, says one authority, they could
signify only a tendency of herd behavior.
   Professor Eugene Jennings finds that in each five-year period
from 1950 through 1969 the average age of newly appointed chief
executives fell, from 57.7 in 1950-1954 to 50.1 in 1965-1969.
   After that, the age at appointment rose steadily again, reaching
56.7 years in the 1980-1984 period.
   But, he advises, it is now on the way down again, and he
projects it will be down to 52 years or less in the 1989-1994
period.
   Such patterns obviously invite economic and political
interpretations, but Jennings cautions against reading too much
into them.
   It may be, he speculates, that it simply ``becomes proper,
smart.''
   Jennings, a pioneer in the study of executive mobility, has been
observing corporations since 1949 and has written the book, so to
speak, on the upward, sideways and downward patterns in the
fortunes of high-ranking executives.
   His basic studies, ``The Mobile Manager'' and ``Routes to the
Executive Suite,'' have educated graduate students, helped
executives understand where they fit in the larger scheme and
guided executive recruiters.
   In studying the numbers, the professor _ he teaches business at
Michigan State University when he isn't offering confidential
advise to chiefs _ found two curious, telling splits, or
indications of bimodality, in the age groupings.
   These splits occurred in 1965-1969 and 1980-1984, and in each
instance led to changes in the pattern.
   When the age level fell to 50.1 years in the earlier period it
hardly represented uniformity. Instead, 33 percent of the
appointments were below age 47 and 35 percent were above 52 years.
   That bimodality, says Jennings, was a turning point. Thereafter,
the average age of appointment began rising again, reaching a top
in 1980-1984. But then that old bimodality came into play again.
   In the latter period, the split found by Jennings was made up of
36 percent below age 50 and 37 percent above age 55. And just as
the split back in the 1960s led to a change in direction of the age
pattern, this one did also.
   Following the latest split, the average age fell sharply in the
1985-1987 period to 54.6 years. And, Jennings speculates, it should
continue falling right into the 1990s.
   Jennings recalls that in the 1960s, when he was well into a
career of advising corporations about their own behavior, he had
little difficulty in selling the idea that a chief executive was
good for five years.
   The notion then, he explains, was to seek optimum power from the
executive staff. ``Get them at their peak, utilize them and get
another.''
   Companies were growing. ``You didn't want to block the movement
of cream to the top,'' he said.
   There was a strong belief in the system, in ``this is the way we
do things at this company.'' Executives were there to manage within
the system, not necessarily to lead.
   Eventually, however, that attitude changed and the age pattern
rose, accompanied by a feeling that a good chairman was hard to
find and so you kept him or her for 10 to 15 years.
   The feeling developed that if age plugged up the movement of
cream to the top, then so be it. ``Those who left because the plug
was stuck in the neck of the bottle were felt to detract less from
the organization than the continued contribution of a well-seasoned
chief,'' Jennings said.
   The new bimodality began showing up as early as 1982, and says
Jennings, probably indicates less belief in the system's strength.
In fact, there is a suspicion that the whole system is probably
faulty and needs changing.
   This split, Jennings says, suggests the feeling has developed in
some corporations that people are needed at the helm who aren't so
enamored with the system that they wouldn't dare to change it.
   ``If my speculation is correct,'' Jennings says, ``we have two
or three years during which corporate systems will continue to be
rebuilt.'' By younger chief executive officers.

<HEAD>Actors' Stretch: Perry King and Lauren Hutton Play Fat</HEAD>

   You wouldn't think Perry King and Lauren
Hutton would need a makeover to be ``Perfect People'' _ until you
saw them in makeup for the ABC movie.
   King, a chiseled, matinee-idol type, spent more than two hours
in makeup every morning to look like a middle-aged, overweight,
out-of-shape couch potato. The same for Hutton, a former fashion
model.
   In ``Perfect People,'' which ABC will telecast Monday, the
couple take a good look at themselves and their lifestyle and
decide to change.
   ``When I read the script, I said this is great but it would be
physically impossible for me to play this role,'' said King.
``After they did a transformation on me and took pictures, nobody
recognized me except my daughter, Louise. She knew me instantly.
   ``I'd walk around in makeup and in the fat suit and see how
people reacted to me. I had thinning hair, bags under my eyes,
jowls. I also spent some time watching fat people to see how they
moved. I also stole from Tom Bray, one of my co-stars on `Riptide.'
He's thin, but he has a lot of mannerisms and gestures. I called
him up and said I was going to use some of them.''
   The movie follows Kenneth and Barbara (Ken and Barbie?) as they
work to regain their lost youth.
   ``Everything we do is possible,'' King said. ``The plastic
surgery, the hair transplants, the implants, the liposuction. But I
hope that we make it very clear that it's potentially dangerous,
painful and takes a long time. So the differences between the way
we looked in the beginning and the way we look at the end can be
done.
   ``Our approach is humorous. We show how they want to look as
they did 20 years earlier and the problems it causes. They're no
longer grounded in reality. If you can change your appearance,
what's real? They were high school sweethearts. It bothers Ken that
men are now ogling at his wife. It shows that you don't fall in
love with someone for their looks. You fall in love with someone
for what they are. It's really a sweet little movie about two good
people.''
   King calls it a nice change from his role as ``a terrible
person'' in the miniseries, ``I'll Take Manhattan.''
   ``I'm getting older and more of my life shows on my face,'' he
said. ``That makes it better for me as an actor. I can be cast in
different parts.''
   King said he was most excited about a pilot for ABC he will do
with Dorian Harewood, with whom he has been friends since they did
the TV movie ``Foster and Laurie'' in 1975 about two New York City
policemen killed in an ambush in 1972.
   The projected series was developed from an idea by Harewood's
wife, Ann McCurry, and her friend, Louise Hoven. The working title
is ``Black and White.''
   ``We're not cops,'' said King. ``We're half-brothers. Our mother
has left us only one thing, an investigative newspaper. The only
way we can keep it going is to work together. There's a lot of
rivalry and dissention between us. Hopefully, it'll have the humor
of `The Rockford Files.' Jim Garner used to call his show an
hour-long smile.
   ``We're two brothers who've had no contact with each other,
although we knew about each other. Our mother had had two marriages
and two separate lives. If would be great if we could do something
with this. People talk all the time about doing something together,
but they never do. So, here are two friends who got an idea and
decided to do something with it.''
   Away from work, he continues to work on his motorcycle
collection. He has eight motorcycles and two sidecars.
   ``It's like owning a fine painting,'' he said. ``If you buy good
stuff you'll never lose a penny. Jay Leno's got really beautiful
stuff. Mine is sort of middle of the road. He has rare motorcycles.
Mine are more common, like Triumphs, BMWs and Ducati.''

   The news lately has been anything but comforting
for people getting ready to file their tax returns for 1987.
   When the General Accounting Office made test queries in the
Internal Revenue Service's telephone assistant program for
taxpayers, it says it got wrong answers 39 percent of the time.
   When Money magazine asked 50 professional preparers to compute
the taxes owed by a hypothetical family, no two came up with the
same number. And the preparers' fees ranged from $187 to $2,500.
   A person might conclude from this that the annual exercise of
reckoning up with Uncle Sam is becoming a high stakes game played
under very uncertain rules.
   If you can't rely totally on the IRS's own people for guidance,
and if the professionals appear to be taking no more than educated
guesses, to whom should you turn for guidance?
   Even for middle-income taxpayers, a lot rides on the answer to
that question. You don't want inadvertently to pay a bigger tax
bill than you have to _ but at the same time, you don't want to
venture into territory that invites an IRS audit.
   And the value of, say, a $500 tax saving pales if it costs you
$600 in preparation fees to get it.
   The whole situation is certainly troublesome, but it need not be
cause for panic. As Money magazine describes it, the ``financial
profile'' of its theoretical family was more complicated than most
people in the real world are likely to have.
   The tax reform law that contributed so much to all this
confusion also made it possible for larger numbers of Americans to
file using short forms.
   Furthermore, there have been gray areas for many years in the
black and white of the income tax forms. Though many people
complain about this, few have been eager to give up their favorite
deductions and credits to the cause of ``simplification.''
   Even in the present turmoil, many people relish the challenge of
tackling the tax forms on their own. They reason that it is about
the only chance they get to work for aftertax pay, since a refund
isn't taxable income.
   If you prefer to let somebody else do the work, there are ways
to improve your chances of coming out in good shape.
   First of all, says Robert Smith, an assistant professor of
accounting at Boston University School of Management, it's
important to figure out what kind of help you need.
   If you determine that your situation is pretty simple, for
instance, you don't want to choose a high-priced preparer who
specializes in dealing with top corporate executives or rock stars.
   If you're not sure whether your case is simple or complicated,
Smith suggests asking for a meeting with a preparer simply to
evaluate the degree of service you need.
   ``Get organized as soon as possible,'' Smith says. ``If your
preparer has to spend time sorting through your records, your bill
may be higher.
   ``Organized records reduce the chance that an error will
occur,'' he adds.
   Another incentive not to put the business off until the April 15
deadline approaches: That is precisely the time when preparers are
the busiest and most in demand.
   ``Some firms lower their fees for clients who come in early or
who are willing to have their return filing date extended,'' Smith
observes.
   Should you find that you need continuing and fairly elaborate
tax help, it makes sense to seek out a preparer the way you would a
family dentist, doctor or lawyer.
   As Smith concludes: ``You may establish a long-term relationship
that will save tax dollars for years to come.''

   Two interreligious affairs leaders say
Catholic-Jewish relations are undergoing a ``severe time of
testing'' which must not be allowed to undermine the extraordinary
improvements in mutual trust since Roman Catholicism's reforming
Second Vatican Council of 1962-65.
   Eugene L. Fisher, executive secretary of the U.S. Catholic
Bishops' Secretariat for Catholic-Jewish Relations, told a
conference real problems remain, but the past gains are
``irreversible and filled with enormous promise.''
   Rabbi James Rudin, the American Jewish Committee's
interreligious affairs director, said, ``In a world filled with
growing religious fanaticism and extremism, we are planting the
seeds of reconciliation'' between Catholics and Jews. ``This
legacy...must be nurtured for the future.''

   A leading evangelical theologian says
continued controversy in the Southern Baptist Convention has
reduced its influence as an evangelical force.
   The Rev. Carl F. H. Henry, a visiting professor at Southern
Baptist Theological Seminary here, said the denomination's
theological-political struggle has produced the image of a divided
denomination, discouraging people from identifying with it.
   ``People in the secular city feel they don't want anything to do
with either'' side in the conflict over Bible interpretation and
organizational control, he said.
   He said energies that would have been devoterd to evangelistic
efforts have been devoted to denominational in-fighting.

   A University of Missouri expert in

Kennedy to the U.S. Supreme Court may result in reopening religion
cases from the past four decades.
   Law professor Carl H. Esbeck says Kennedy, a Roman Catholic, can
be expected to support government aid to parochial schools, a more
balanced role for religion in public school textbooks, and a
voluntary moment of silence for school children.

   A noted church growth specialist says
the ``prognosis for the Sunday school in America is not good,''
with total enrollment in Sunday schools falling from 40.5 million
in 1970 to 26.6 million in 1986.
   Win Arn, head of the Institute for American Church Growth, says
that in 1970, only 10 percent of the adult population said they
received no religious training as a child, while in 1986, the
proportion had climbed to 27 percent.

<HEAD>Glorified Preachers Seen As Most Vulnerable To Downfall</HEAD>

   The minister basked in glory, so exalted that
special choirs of women sang praises to him. Born poor, he had
become rich and famous. When he preached, people sighed and waved
handkerchiefs in admiration.
   But he tumbled into obloquy.
   That happened to a third-century Syrian bishop, Paul Samosata,
dethroned as a heretic, a story recalled as resembling the fall of
modern TV-famed evangelists, including the latest, Jimmy Swaggart.
   ``There's nothing new in this _ it's as old as the hills,'' says
Stanley M. Burgess, professor of religion at Southwestern Missouri
State University in Springfield, Mo., but TV makes it a spectacle
for millions.
   ``The higher the pedestal, the heavier the winds,'' Burgess said
in a telephone interview. ``The higher they get up the mountain,
the thicker the fog.
   `It's harder for them to reflect on themselves and see who they
really are. With people constantly telling them how wonderful they
are, that they're the `man of God for this hour,' it's not a
position to be in if one wants to be honest with himself.''
   It's the old egocentric problem, as old as the biblical Adam who
sought to be God himself, but Burgess said the glorified are
especially vulnerable.
   ``This is a common strand that runs through all religious
literature,'' he said.
   As Second Samuel 1:25 puts it, ``How the mighty are fallen.''
   Swaggart's fall, over reported involvement with a prostitute, is
particularly stark because of his ``hard-line preaching,'' Burgess
said.
   ``He had preached against almost everything imaginable, and then
for him to do the very thing he preached against makes it all the
more dramatic,'' Burgess said.
   Burgess, a scholar of the Assemblies of God, the denomination to
which Swaggart belongs, said some ministers go wrong in every
century, and in every denomination ``virtually every day.''
   But Swaggart, who lashed out at sexual lapses, becomes ``the
epitome of hyprocrisy,'' Burgess said. ``I do appreciate that he
came out with it.''
   Richard Champion, editor of the denomination's weekly,
Pentecostal Evangel, said that when ``people surround themselves
with those who always agree, who tell them only good things, they
get tripped up in public adulation.
   ``Ego takes over, and gets out of control. They see evil as
something in other people, and rationalize their own
behavior...With somebody like Swaggart, it a very visible thing.''
   Clinical psychgologist Larry Bass of Springfield, Mo., said that
without being specific about Swaggart, his case seemed to fit the
category of someone who has ``difficulty accepting his own
humanness.
   ``While he is so vocal attacking other people's sexual sins, he
is guilty of some of that himself and struggling with it, but he
feels as if he has to be above it, and so he hides it.
   ``He comes across as very judgmental and critical of other
people. He can't accept his his own vulnerability to sin, so what
he has to do is hide it in a kind of self-righteous hypocrisy.''
   Bass, who also belongs to the Assemblies of God, said that many
times those who are the ``most judgmental, putting down others and
condemning, are guilty of the same thing they're haranguing about.
   ``But they have to hide it, that's the shame, they're so afraid
to deal with it.''
   That kind of ``ego is a tremendous burden to carry around,''
Bass said, adding that Swaggart's preaching often was bigoted and
absolutist, condemning other religions as well as other people.
   ``That was his downfall,'' Bass said.
   He noted Swaggart had been ``very, very vocal'' in condemning
preachers caught in sex scandals, including fallen TV evangelist
Jim Bakker and New Orleans evangelist Marvin Gorman.
   Swaggart admitted to his congregation Sunday he had been
involved in sin after Gorman reportedly supplied church officials
with pictures of Swaggart at a motel with a prostitute.
   Bass said the highly judgmental types have a ``kind of
omnipotence that `I can get away with things,' that `I'm above it
all,' above the rules, but it finally catches up with them.
   ``He had pushed himself and was most successful, but he had
faults and inferiorities that he was hiding and running from. That
isn't healthy or mature, and it finally is self-defeating.''
   Robert Spence, president of the denomination's Evangel College
in Springfield, said the ``eminently successful'' tend to live in
an ``unreal world, filled with people who say only what they
think'' is wanted.
   ``It become unreal, an artificial environment, that distorts the
whole perspective, and leads a person to the point of assuming he's
stronger than he really is...He's lulled to the place he thinks
that `what bothers other people doesn't bother me'.''

   At age 65, native Texan George A.
McAlister is a big, friendly, drawling former coach, educator and
inventor turned businessman, rancher, historian, author and dreamer.
   His dream was to make a film based on the battle of the Alamo.
That dream is coming true.
   With blazing cannons and bloody sabres, the heroes of the Alamo
relive on a giant new screen this week the fateful 13-day siege
that inspired Texas to win its independence from Mexico in 1836. A
black-tie premiere of the docudrama is set for Saturday.
   Entitled ``Alamo ... The Price of Freedom,'' the 45-minute film
is an account of the battle based largely on the research and books
of McAlister, and it has stirred some controversy.
   Academy Award-winning filmmaker Kieth Merrill directed the
movie, part of a $7.2 million project that includes a new IMAX
theater with its 84{-foot wide, six-story high screen. The 426-seat
theater is housed in the new Rivercenter Mall, which overlooks the
Alamo grounds.
   The IMAX system is designed to give viewers visually stunning
images as well as a sense of participation in the on-screen
activity.
   ``The Price of Freedom'' was filmed last summer at Alamo Village
near Brackettville, where John Wayne built the set for his epic
1960 film, ``The Alamo.''
   Saturday's premiere benefits the research library operated by
the Daughters of the Republic of Texas and includes a reception and
dinner-dance and remarks by Dallas billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt.
   Gov. Bill Clements will be on hand the next day for formal
dedication ceremonies, which coincide with the 152nd anniversary of
the fall of the Alamo to Mexican Gen. Santa Anna.
   ``There are two great symbols of freedom in America,'' McAlister
said. ``First is the Statue of Liberty. But it is just that _ a
symbol of freedom. Then there is this old stone mission, the Alamo,
a shrine to the price of freedom.
   ``And there is a difference between a symbol of freedom and a
price of freedom.''
   A veteran of World War II and the Korean conflict, McAlister
pointed out gently that a lot of people are willing to live for a
cause but only a very few are willing to die for one.
   ``The defenders of the Alamo were willing to die for freedom,''
he said. ``And more than 3 million people from all over the world
came to the Alamo last year to pay homage to those 189 brave men
who gave their lives that Texas might be free.''
   McAlister once stood outside the Alamo for days asking visitors
if they would pay to see an authentic movie of the historic battle
and if they were familiar with IMAX theaters.
   He liked the answers. And the premiere this weekend showcases
the results of that private poll.
   While stressing the importance of authenticity, McAlister points
out quickly that much of what occurred at the Alamo is subject to
speculation and individual interpretation.
   ``There are no chronicles of the Alamo and what happened
there,'' he said.
   Still, McAlister spent 12 years researching his books. His
travels took him to Goliad, San Jacinto, Washington-on-the-Brazos
and other battle sites and to Louisiana, Tennessee, South Carolina
and Alabama to visit the hometowns of the most famous defenders of
the Alamo: Col. William B. Travis, Jim Bowie, Davy Crockett and
James Bonham.
   McAlister also describes the Alamo contribution of the Tejanos,
the nine Mexicans who supported the Texas cause.
   He and his colleagues say they have made their movie as
historically accurate as possible without sacrificing dramatic and
entertainment value.
   ``If we were going to make a movie for several generations, I
did not want it to be fiction,'' McAlister said.
   The movie has no stars but uses 450 members of war-enactment
societies across the country who are dedicated to historical
accuracy, costume and customs.
   McAlister was surprised and dismayed when San Antonio City
Councilman Walter Martinez and a group of residents accused the
producers of distorting historical facts.
   After viewing a rough cut of the movie, Martinez complained that
the film demeaned Hispanics by making them look like bad guys, and
presented a list of objections to Texas Cavalcade Corp., the
production group headed by McAlister.
   Kathy Pena-Sosa, a spokeswoman for Texas Cavalcade, said some
objectionable scenes were deleted in the final editing from 73
minutes to 45 minutes, but professed to be puzzled by the criticism.
   ``In a community that's 54 percent Hispanic,'' she said, ``we're
not going to make a movie that's offensive to Hispanics.''
   Born and raised in East Texas, McAlister got his first exposure
to Texas history in a two-room, two-teacher schoolhouse in a tiny
hamlet near Commerce.
   He interrupted his collegiate studies at East Texas State in
1942 to enlist in the Marines, but returned after the war to get a
master's degree in math. His minor was history.
   During an academic career that was interrupted when he was
recalled to active duty in Korea in 1950, McAlister was a dean at
Howard County Junior College in Big Spring, as well as chairman of
the math department, coach of the track team and an amateur
inventor.
   In 1955, with $150, he founded a company called GAMCO to create
and build teaching aids for math students, including a classroom
computer and an electronic teaching machine. The sale of GAMCO in
1966 made him a millionaire.
   It also freed him to pursue his ranching and writing interests
and to devote more time to historical research.
   His first novel, ``Nothing is Forever,'' was based on the early
life of Travis. That book evolved into a second novel, ``A Time to
Love ... A Time to Die.''
   This led in turn to ``Alamo ... The Price of Freedom,'' a
non-fiction book which McAlister describes as ``history as I view
it and my personal research reveals it.''
   For McAlister, ``The Price of Freedom'' is more than a movie or
a business venture.
   Said he: ``I would like to leave a legacy on the screen that
retells the story of this sacrifice for freedom ... that
demonstrates to a new generation that freedom isn't free ... that
liberty rests finally on those willing to die for it.''

   The United States and the Soviet Union both are
pushing for an end to the war in Afghanistan as negotiations in
Geneva enter a decisive stage this week, but complex issues remain
to be settled.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz's talks in Moscow last week
ended on a note of optimism. The Kremlin said again it wants to end
the Red Army intervention that has cost an estimated 10,000 Soviet
lives in what Mikhail S. Gorbachev has called a ``bleeding wound.''
   Pakistan and Afghanistan are negotiating with United Nations
mediation. But the two major players are the Soviet Union, which
intervened in 1979, and the United States, which backs the Moslem
guerrilla forces fighting Afghanistan's Marxist government.
   The Soviet leader sent hopes soaring when he pledged Moscow will
withdraw its estimated 115,000 troops within ten months starting
May 15, provided a peace settlement is signed by Pakistan and
Afghanistan by March 15.
   With the Geneva talks starting Wednesday, Gorbachev's deadline
would leave just 13 days to tie up the package of agreements
designed to end nine years of fighting.
   After a 20-day shuttle between Kabul and Islamabad, U.N.
mediator Diego Cordovez reported early this month ``virtual
agreement'' on the timetable of the Soviet withdrawal. The United
States and Pakistan still would prefer to give the Soviets less
than 10 months to leave.
   In almost six years of negotiations, accords have been reached
on mutual non-interference, on superpower guarantees that
Afghanistan will be non-aligned, and on the return of 3.5 million
Afghans sheltered by Pakistan _ the largest concentration of
refugees in the world.
   But crucial aspects are still unresolved. The major issues:
   _At what stage is the aid to the guerrillas to be cut off?
Gorbachev hinted in a Feb. 8 statement the American support is no
longer a problem.
   But Washington officials have said the timing of the cutoff has
not yet been determined. U.S. supplies reportedly totaled $670
million in 1987. The supplies funneled through Pakistan include
shoulder-fired Stinger missiles said to have downed more than 200
Soviet and Afghan aircraft.
   _How should the withdrawal be phased? Gorbachev has said a
``relatively greater portion'' of the Soviet forces will be
withdrawn rapidly. But a diplomatic source close to the talks, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said there were still ``very
different approaches'' to the pace of the withdrawal.
   _Will the settlement involve Iran, host to another 2 million
Afghan refugees and base for other Moslem resistance groups
pressing for a non-Marxist Islamic government? Iran has refused to
join in the talks but says it will accept any settlement satisfying
the ``legitimate aspirations'' of the Afghan people.
   The most difficult question, however, is outside the scope of
the Geneva talks: Who will sign for Afghanistan and what government
will be installed in Kabul during the withdrawal?
   Pakistan argues that a durable settlement requires the prior
formation of a ``broad-based'' interim government to prevent more
bloodshed and assure the refugees' safe return.
   President Zia Ul-Haq said in an interview in The Washington Post
last month that Pakistan would not sign any settlement with the
present Marxist government headed by President Najib in Kabul, the
Afghan capital.
   Pakistan does not recognize Najib's government and insists the
Geneva talks be conducted in an indirect fashion, with Cordovez
acting as go-between. Zia reportedly would like to see an interim
coalition in Kabul, including the anti-Marxist guerrillas, Afghan
exiles and some representatives of Najib's People's Democratic
Party.
   Gorbachev, who assured a visiting Najib in December 1986 that
Moscow would not abandon him, says the makeup of the future
government is an internal matter and ``none of our business.''
   Still, Gorbachev is expected to seek some guarantee to prevent a
bloodbath during or after the troop withdrawal. Otherwise, Najib
and members of his government, as well as departing Soviets, could
be left defenseless against reprisal killings.
   The Soviet Union shares a long border with Afghanistan and there
has been no indication whether the Kremlin will be willing to
relinquish any attempt to influence events in the country once the
Red Army is withdrawn.
   Most of the Pakistan-based groups representing the estimated
200,000 Moslem guerrillas fighting the Soviets and the Kabul
government's army of about 50,000 have ruled out any power-sharing
with Najib.
   Last week, the guerrillas announced plans for a 28-member
transitional Cabinet to replace Najib's government and sign the
Geneva settlement on behalf of Afghanistan ``if the terms are
deemed acceptable.''
   The insurgents vowed they would not lay down their arms until an
Islamic government was established.
   Kabul radio reported that Najib insisted a new government should
be formed after the Soviet forces withdraw and the composition of a
new government is a matter for ``Afghans alone.''
   At the same time, Pakistan is trying to win allies in its push
for an intersion would be similar to President
Reagan's proposal that was narrowly killed by the House three weeks
ago, but would exclude any money for new weapons. It would retain
the CIA as delivery agent for the supplies, and would give
President Reagan the right to seek a new vote on a weapons package
after May 1.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, called the Democratic
proposal ``the most workable kind of program'' and one that will
provide ``balanced incentives'' for the Contras and the leftist
Sandinista government to pursue peace talks called for in a
regional accord.
   The package was unveiled late Tuesday by Rep. David Bonior,
D-Mich., after two weeks of intensive negotiations among several
factions of the chamber's majority party. It went before the Rules
Committee today, where Republicans were expected to demand the
right to offer their own alternative.
   President Reagan did not immediately react to the Democrats'
package. His own $36.2 million aid proposal for the rebels,
including weapons, was narrowly rejected by the House three weeks
ago.
   Among major elements in the Democratic proposal:
   _About $3.6 million a month for the Contras: half to buy food,
clothing, medicine and shelter, and the other half to pay for
delivery of the supplies to rebel troops inside Nicaragua. The aid
would run from March 1, after current aid expires, until June 30.
It could continue until the end of the year if a cease-fire is
reached by June 30.
   _About $1.4 million for Nicaragua's Miskito Indians, an
opposition group that has been carrying out its own battle against
the Sandinistas, but has consistently refused invitations to join
with the Contras. The Indians already have worked out their own
cease-fire with the Managua regime.
   _A new $14 million ``Children's Survival Fund,'' to provide
medical help for children on all sides of the conflict. The aid
would be administered by ``non-political'' private aid groups or
international relief agencies already working in the region.
   Not included in the package was any long-term economic
development aid for the region, but a Democratic fact sheet said
``Congress will welcome proposals'' from Reagan on that subject.
   Current aid to the rebels expires Feb. 29, and with it the legal
authority for the CIA to continue air drops of previously
stockpiled weapons and ammunition. The new package contains no such
authority.
   Under the new proposal, the Contras' ``humanitarian'' supplies
would be delivered by private contractors supervised by the Defense
Department until the Contras and the Sandinistas are able to agree
on a cease-fire.
   The deliveries would be monitored by the congressional
intelligence committees and the General Accounting Office,
Congress' investigative arm, to ensure that no weapons were
included.
   After fighting stops, responsibility for delivery would shift to
a private aid group or an international relief agency such as the
Red Cross.
   The package also would provide for an expedited procedure for a
vote on new military aid for the rebels _ a high priority for the
Reagan administration _ if a cease-fire should fall apart and the
Sandinistas should fail to keep their promises to democratize.
   The determination of whether expedited procedures should be
initiated would be made by the House Intelligence Committees,
according to a fact sheet on the package. But Republicans were
skeptical of the provision, saying it was not a solid guarantee
that military aid would come to a quick vote in both the House and
Senate.
   Wright said he was ``not necessarily'' confident of the votes to
pass the package. Republicans have remained aloof from the drafting
process, holding out for more aid and for continued authority for
the CIA to deliver previously stockpiled eapons.
   ``The key to this really will be how much support it gets on the
Republican side,'' said Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., a longtime
Contra aid opponent who added that he planned to vote against the
package.
   Other Democrats said they expected at least 70 in their party to
oppose the proposal.
   ``The party is seeking a middle ground on an issue that is not
compromisable,'' said Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J. ``It appears
to me to be an exercise in attempting to cover ourselves'' and
avoid political blame if the Contras go out of business and the
Sandinistas renege on promises to increase civil liberties.
   Democrats have argued against new military aid, saying that
providing it would endanger peace efforts. Talks between the
Contras and Sandinistas broke off over the weekend without
progress, and no date has been set for their resumption.
   Reagan and many congressional Republicans have countered that it
is only consistent military pressure from rebel attacks that has
forced the Sandinistas into peace talks.

   A dozen turbaned, bearded men with
machine guns patrol a walled villa where the seven leaders of
Afghanistan's guerrilla alliance draw up plans for an Islamic
nation of Afghanistan.
   The meetings have become almost continuous in this dusty
frontier city, a short ride from the Afghan border, since the
Soviet Union announced last month it planned to pull out troops
backing Afghanistan's Marxist government. Moscow said it would
withdraw its estimated 115,000 soldiers within ten months starting
May 15 if Pakistan and Afghanistan sign a peace agreement by March
15.
   With the Geneva talks entering a crucial stage on Wednesday, the
time pressure is helping fuse the often fractious Mujahedeen
guerrilla military alliance into a united political force.
   ``They're closer than before but the question is, for how
long?'' said Abdul Haq, a guerrilla commander from Kabul province.
   So far, the resistance leaders have agreed to install themselves
as a joint executive over a 28-member cabinet that will include
guerrillas, Afghan refugees and Moslems ``presently living in
Kabul.''
   It calls for the head of a cabinet to be head of state, but the
plan contains no names. It proposes to replace the Soviet-backed
Kabul government before an accord is signed at the U.N.-sponsored
talks in Geneva.
   Neither Pakistan, which backs the guerrillas, nor the Afghan
communists appears likely to accept the proposal unchanged. The
Pakistanis have told the insurgents they may have to share power
with the communists, at least in a transitional regime.
   ``We're in a hurry. There is little time,'' said Abdul Qadir
Karyad, head of the political wing of the fervent Moslem party
Hezb-i-Islami, led by Gulbaddin Hekmatyar.
   Although his party is considered the most extreme of the
``fundamentalist'' groups, Karyad indicated the Hezb-i-Islami was
coming around to compromise with the more moderate ones in the name
of unity.
   ``We want to be logical. We want to show the world we can accept
responsibility for our country,'' Karyad said.
   Nevertheless, the guerrillas' blueprint for a new government
does not explain just how it would come to power. It assumes the
Soviet-backed Kabul regime will simply step aside.
   The flurry of compromise follows Pakistan's insistence that an
Afghan settlement must consist of a military accord, such as the
one near completion at Geneva, and a political accord for a
``broad-based'' interim government that could head off a bloody
power struggle as Soviet troops head home.
   The three ``moderate'' guerrilla parties _ Ittehad, the Afghan
National Liberation Front and the National Islamic Front for the
Liberation of Afghanistan _ apparently have dropped their support
of bringing back ousted King Zahir Shah to head a neutral
transitional regime.
   ``It's not really proper to raise the Zahir Shah issue just
now,'' said Zabiullah Mojaddedi, son of ANLF leader Sibghatullah
Mojaddedi. ``We should have a leader from within the Mujahedeen. If
not, then we can consider that option.''
   All seven parties fully agree on one point: They refuse to join
even a temporary coalition with communists.
   ``How can I work in an office with somebody who killed my
brother, my neighbors?'' said Karyad.
   Hezb-i-Islami, along with the Jamiat-i-Islami and the
Hezb-i-Islami faction led by alliance chairman Yunis Khalis, have
gone so far as to threaten to ignore a Geneva accord as long as the
Mujahedeen are excluded from the talks.
   The indirect negotiations have been between the Kabul government
and Pakistan, which serves as the guerrillas' headquarters and
shelters about 3.5 million Afghan refugees. The United States,
which backs the guerrillas, and the Soviet Union are to be the
guarantors of an accord.
   All seven resistance parties say they want to negotiate directly
with the Soviets because they view the Kabul government as Moscow's
puppet.
   ``I hope the Soviets will be wise enough to sit down and discuss
the technicalities (of a withdrawal) with the Mujahedeen,''
Mojaddedi said.

   Here is a brief look at what the Soviet Union
hopes to achieve in the March 2 negotiations in Geneva between its
ally, Afghanistan, and Pakistan.
   _ Through their Afghan allies, the Soviets likely will formally
commit themselves to withdrawing their estimated 115,000 troops
starting May 15 and to completing the process within 10 months.
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced the plan on Feb. 8.
   _ The Kremlin is likely to reiterate its demand that the United
States, Pakistan and other Western countries stop supplying weapons
to the Moslem guerrillas fighting the pro-Soviet Kabul government.
The Soviets have suffered heavy losses of aircraft since the United
States and Britain first began sending the rebels Stinger
antiaircraft missiles, which can track and down aircraft by sensing
engine heat.
   _ Gorbachev has said his country wants no say in who governs
Afghanistan or the country's politics after the troops come home.
Even so, he is expected to seek some guarantee that a bloodbath
will not occur during or after the troop withdrawal. Without such a
promise, Afghan leader Najib and members of his government, as well
as departing Soviets, would be left defenseless against a
widespread insurgency, which could lead to reprisal killings.
   _ The Soviets likely will resist any attempts by Pakistan to tie
an Afghan settlement in Geneva to formation of a coalition
government in Afghanistan. Gorbachev said Afghanistan's future
government should be decided as ``an internal matter.'' Ranking
Soviet officials have accused Pakistan of delaying a settlement by
insisting the future government issue be resolved before the troop
withdrawal begins. Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli
Vorontsov contended in a Pravda interview published Thursday that
the future government ``has nothing to do with the Geneva
agreements.''

   Here is a brief look at what the United States
hopes to achieve in the negotiations between Afghanistan and
Pakistan in Geneva:
   _ The withdrawal of an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops from
Afghanistan has been a high priority for the White House and
Congress since the Soviet occupation began in December 1979.
   Quick withdrawal remains an immediate goal of the United States,
the anti-Marxist Moslem guerrillas and the pro-Western government
in Pakistan, which has provided sanctuary for 3.5 million Afghans
and channels millions of dollars in covert military aid to the
resistance from the United States, China and Arab nations.
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz and other U.S. officials
welcomed the statement by Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev that he
wants to start pulling the estimated 120,000 Red Army soldiers out
of Afghanistan by May 15 if U.N.-sponsored negotiations produce an
agreement by March 15.
   But the Reagan administration is pushing the Soviets to either
shorten their proposed 10-month withdrawal, or to pull out most
troops early.
   ``We don't see any reason why they couldn't be out by the end of
the year if they start in the middle of May,'' Shultz said.
   Under a plan being discussed behind the scenes, the United
States would stop sending military aid as soon as the Soviets began
to withdraw. Half the Soviet troops would withdraw within the first
90 days, 30,000 more over the next 90 days, and the remaining
30,000 over the following four months.
   _ A longer term goal, on which guerrilla groups and the
Pakistani government are split, is over the government to replace
the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul. U.S. officials believe that no
pro-Soviet regime could survive after the Red Army leaves.
   Shultz said this month that the guerrillas would not accept
positions in a government run by President Najib, the head of the
Kabul regime.
   ``It is difficult to imagine how an interim regime is going to
be put together,'' Shultz said.

   For the first time since 1928, a U.S. governor
faces trial before his legislature Monday. In the following report,
an AP special correspondent offers a portrait of Arizona, its
people and their governor at the crossroads of impeachment.

<TEXT>
   For Evan Mecham, Arizona's
governor-in-exile, it has come to high noon.
   Here in the land of Geronimo and Wyatt Earp and the OK Corral, a
part of America never known for pussyfooting, the Arizona Senate on
Monday begins the final act in a course of redress not seen in this
nation in more than half a century. It will decide whether to
remove the impeached governor from office.
   Members of the Senate will not predict the outcome, only that it
likely will be close and that however it turns out there will be,
politically speaking, a lot of blood left on the ground.
   ``It's ripping up our party and state in a fashion that's going
to take years to recover,'' says U.S. Sen. John McCain.
   When McCain and three other Republican members of Arizona's
congressional delegation suggested that fellow Republican Mecham
resign, the senator began receiving hate mail by the sackful.
   ``The mob that crucified our Precious Lord is the same kind of
mob that is after our governor,'' wrote one constituent.
   The other day about 2,000 Mecham supporters took out their
anger, while raising money for his defense, by bashing an
automobile with a sledgehammer, three licks for a dollar. The car
was painted with slogans such as ``media bias,'' identifying what
they perceived as the causes of the governor's predicament.
   The Arizona House approved impeachment articles Feb. 5 accusing
Mecham of concealing a $350,000 campaign loan, misusing $80,000
from funds raised by his inauguration committee, and trying to
thwart an investigation into a state official's alleged death
threat against a witness in a grand jury probe of Mecham.
   The 63-year-old, staunchly conservative governor also had
antagonized many Arizonans with controversial statements on ethnic
groups and social issues.
   After the vote, Mecham stepped down provisionally as governor
and moved into political exile, in an office in nearby Glendale.
Now the House charges are to be tried in the 30-member Senate,
where 20 votes would convict him and remove him permanently from
office.
   But not even the extreme measure of an impeachment trial is
likely to put to rest the turmoil in Arizona. If Mecham survives,
he still faces a criminal trial for not reporting a campaign loan
and a recall election resulting from a public petition.
   Recall election? All right then, said Mecham supporters, and
began circulating petitions to recall as well House members who
voted for the governor's impeachment.
   Yes, there is little stability these days in Arizona politics.
   Anywhere in Arizona, for that matter.
   The Phoenix area, Maricopa County, is the second-fastest-growing
urban area in America, just behind San Diego. It gains one new
citizen every 12 minutes. That's net gain. State figures also show
that for every four newcomers, three others move out.
   All that coming and going causes such instability that one
mental health organization recommended a state program to
discourage growth. Arizona, for instance, has one of the nation's
highest divorce rates, a suicide rate 50 percent higher than the
national average and, among adolescents, 70 percent higher. It also
ranks last in per-capita funding for mental health.
   ``We have an enormous amount of work to do in this state,'' says
state Sen. Greg Lunn, a Tucson Republican.
   ``That's another reason why the impeachment is such a
distracting turn of events. The Senate will be tied up with it for
weeks. Important matters that should be dealt with this session
will have to be deferred to the next.''
   Lunn has a special interest in environmental matters. Well he
might. The Phoenix area is promoted to tourists and potential
settlers as the Valley of the Sun. But dust and emissions and
temperature inversions conspire against the sun. Phoenix's smog
rivals the worst in the nation. So do its traffic jams.

<HEAD>Phoenix, Ariz.: traffic jams.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Once outside Phoenix, however, or Tucson, the state's only two
urban areas, you can drive for hours without seeing another car.
Geographically as well as politically and socially, Arizona is a
state of stunning contrasts and contradictions.
   The state is sixth in the nation in size but its 3.35 million
population ranks 25th. Three-fourths of its people live in the
Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas. The rest live in villages
and towns scattered across mountains and deserts and forests
staggering in their solitude, and, in many areas, their poverty.
   In rural areas much of the frontier west prevails, and not just
in the rigorously independent attitude of the people. At Cordes
Junction, near Prescott, the cafe requires patrons to check their
weapons at the door. Many do just that, since in Arizona it's
perfectly legal to pack a gun openly.
   Rivalry in Arizona is fierce between city and country for the
state's attention to their needs. Mecham was supported by rural
voters who saw his two election opponents as representing the
Phoenix elite. His impeachment intensifies those jealousies.
   Feelings for and against Evan Mecham are held with such passion
that some longtime friends are reluctant to bring up the subject,
not knowing how the other stands.
   ``Some thingsks and Orientals. He dismissed those petitioning for his
recall
as ``dissident Democrats and homosexuals.''
   Now it comes down to the impeachment trial itself.
   Only 15 U.S. governors have faced impeachment proceedings. Only
seven were removed from office, the last Oklahoma's Henry Simpson
Johnston in 1928.
   Thomas Jefferson was once impeached, in 1781 as governor of
Virginia. His accuser was Patrick Henry, who thought Jefferson left
the capital with unseemly haste when British troops attacked.
Jefferson insisted on a trial and won vindication.
   So Evan Mecham, it appears, is in pretty good company. But,
then, so are his accusers.

<HEAD>Mix of State and Local Issues On Super Tuesday Ballots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE SILVERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The battle for the White House won't be the only thing on the
minds of some Super Tuesday voters. In Mississippi, they'll begin
choosing a new senator; in Louisiana's 4th District they may elect
a new congressman, and in Monroe, N.C., they'll decide whether to
legalize sales of mixed drinks.
   Of the 20 mostly Southern and border states holding presidential
primaries and caucuses March 8, four _ Arkansas, Mississippi,
Maryland and Texas _ are holding their regular state primaries at
the same time.
   But even in places where the state primary will be held later,
officials have slipped statewide or local issues onto the Super
Tuesday ballot.
   ``It's a cost-effective measure and it would tend to draw a
larger turnout for both issues,'' explains Jim Hamilton of the
Florida division of elections.
   In Mississippi, the retirement of Sen. John C. Stennis after 41
years has sparked a close Democratic primary race between Rep.
Wayne Dowdy and Secretary of State Dick Molpus. Ed Cole, state
Democratic chairman, says the combination of the presidential and
Senate primaries ``should ensure a pretty good turnout.'' Rep.
Trent Lott is unopposed for the GOP nomination.
   In Maryland and Texas, Democratic Sens. Lloyd Bentsen and Paul
Sarbanes faces token challenges for renomination and will be
heavily favored over whichever Republicans win their party's
nominations. Texas also has primaries for five of nine seats on its
Supreme Court, which has become a political battleground with two
justices publicly reprimanded, two others quitting and Republicans
hoping to achieve an unprecedented majority.
   Arkansas features a heated Democratic primary in the 1st
Congressional District, where 10-term Rep. Bill Alexander is
challenged by campaign consultant Darrell Glascock, who says the
incumbent neglects his district and spends too much time jetting to
Central America.
   The Texas secretary of state estimated it would have cost $12
million extra to hold separate state and presidential primaries.
Bob Fisher of the Arkansas attorney general's office said the two
parties would have had to ``raise filing fees to an unholy amount''
to finance separate primaries.
   In Louisiana, voters in the 4th District will select a
replacement in the U.S. House for Gov.-elect Buddy Roemer, who
takes office on March 14. Roemer asked that the balloting be
scheduled for Super Tuesday to cut down on election costs in his
financially strapped state.
   Nine Democrats and one Republican are competing in the open
primary in which a candidate is elected if he receives a majority.
Otherwise, the top two finishers compete in a runoff. The field
includes former Rep. Claude ``Buddy'' Leach, who lost to Roemer in
1980 following Leach's acquittal on vote-buying charges.
   In Georgia, legislators added a statewide referendum to the
ballot with the hope of bolstering turnout for the presidential
primary. The measure asks voters whether to increase from $8,000 to
$10,000 the amount of gross income people 62 and older may receive
and still be exempt from some school and property taxes.
   ``Every presiding officer that I've talked with, every governor,
is worried about a low turnout,'' said Speaker of the House Tom
Murphy prior to pushing the referendum through the General
Assembly. ``We need a tremendous turnout _ the more folks the
better.''
   In North Carolina, referendums on whether to permit mixed drink
sales are scheduled in Monroe and three other cities and counties.
   ``This is an excellent way to avoid the cost of a separate
election,'' said state Treasurer Harlan Boyles. ``In Wake County,
for example, they're having a separate election and it will cost
something like $100,000.''
   In Tennessee, state Election Coordinator David Haines estimates
that about 40 of 95 counties will hold their primaries for tax
assessor and school superintendent on March 8, mainly to save money.
   The Tennessee Legislature last year appropriated $2 million to
cover the cost of the presidential primary, and gave counties the
option of conducting their county primaries then at state expense
or in May at their own. Counties must also pay for the August
statewide primary and the November general election.
   Ironically, in Oklahoma, two ballot issues relating to economic
development were taken off the March 8 ballot and rescheduled for
September because of fears that they wouldn't get the necessary
attention because of the presidential campaign.
   ``The two were so important that we were afraid they would get
lost in all the hullabaloo, in all the things going on,'' said Gov.
Henry Bellmon's assistant press secretary, Wendy Johnson.

   Governing boards of two of the nation's
largest energy unions have met separately in Denver to discuss a
possible merger, according to a union source.
   Executive boards of the United Mine Workers of America and the
Oil Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union have been
meeting privately in Denver since Monday, the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said Tuesday.
   Experts said the combination of the unions _ each of which
report about 100,000 active members _ would consolidate the
bargaining power of the two unions in their dealings with major oil
companies.

   The Supreme Court has ruled that businesses
may not be sued in federal court in certain cases involving their
contributions to union benefit funds.
   The court said Tuesday the federal courts have no authority over
cases in which companies refuse to contribute to multi-employer
union benefit funds after a collective bargaining agreement expires.
   In an 8-0 ruling in a case from California, the court rejected
Reagan administration arguments that barring lawsuits in such cases
could undermine the solvency of the multi-employer pension plans.

   Footwear maker Nike Inc., which has been using
the Beatles' recording of the song ``Revolution'' in its
advertising despite the group's protests, plans to scrap the ads
next month.
   Nike spokesman Kevin Brown said the athletic footwear company
was happy with the results of the ads, which have been running
since last spring, but wants to freshen its advertising approach.
   As a result, he said Nike decided against exercising its option
to use the Beatles' recording for another year.
   Its license to use the recording expires March 22, but before it
runs out, Brown said Nike plans to run one more new commercial with
the song. The new ad, which debuts this week, is aimed mainly at
women, he said.
   Nike's ``Revolution'' commercials to date have shown people
walking, playing basketball and participating in other sports while
wearing Nike shoes. The only sound is the Beatles' recording.
   The three surviving Beatles, through their recording company,
Apple Records, have claimed they never intended that their
recordings be used in commercials.
   Nike, which is based in Beaverton, Ore., has insisted it is an
innocent bystander in a longstanding dispute between Apple and
companies that hold the licensing rights to the Beatle's original
recordings.
   Nike reportedly paid $250,000 to Capitol Records Inc., which
holds the North American licensing rights to the Beatles'
recordings, for the right to use the group's rendition of
``Revolution'' in Nike ads for a year.
   Last July, Apple Records, controlled by the three surviving
Beatles and John Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, filed a suit charging
that Nike was using the rock group's ``persona and goodwill'' in
its advertising without permission.
   The suit, which is still pending in U.S. District Court in New
York, asked for $15 million in damages and named Nike and its ad
agency, Capitol Records and EMI Records Ltd., which holds licensing
rights outside North America.
   Nike has contended it had a valid contract to use the recording,
intended no disrespect to the Beatles and was an innocent victim in
a dispute between Apple, Capitol and EMI.
   Leonard M. Marks, an attorney for Apple, said he felt the
decision showed Nike was ``being responsive to the lawsuit and the
numerous complaints of Beatles fans'' about its use of the
recordings.
   He said he was optimistic that after Nike's action ``we will be
able to reach a settlement of the case with Nike shortly.''
   But Brown insisted the decision not to renew rights to the music
was unrelated to the suit.
   ``It was a business decision,'' he said. ``It makes sense to
continuously update your ads.''
   He said Nike had received about 150 to 200 letters from people
objecting to Nike's use of the song, but said the company was
generally satisfied with the performance of the ads. He said sales
for the six months ended Nov. 30 were up substantially from the
same period a year earlier.

   Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, which
sought bankruptcy-court protection because of the stalled $5.2
billion Seabrook nuclear plant, has attracted takeover interest
from a neighboring utility.
   The proposed takeover disclosed Tuesday by New England Electric
System, based in Westborough, Mass., would not include Public
Service's 36 percent share of Seabrook.
   It also would require approval by a bankruptcy judge, state
regulators in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, both companies'
directors and possibly some federal agencies.
   Public Service, New Hampshire's largest power company and the
lead Seabrook owner, sought federal bankruptcy protection last
month, a move that symbolized the difficulties facing public
utilities with heavy investments in nuclear power. It became the
first major investor-owned utility to seek the refuge of bankruptcy
court since the Depression.
   Under New England Electric's proposal, Public Service, would be
left only with its share of the reactor, which is completed but has
been unable to surmount evacuation-planning obstacles to an
operating license.
   New England Electric subsidiary New England Power Co. owns 10
percent of Seabrook. Officials of the parent company would not
comment on why they don't want to increase their share of the
controversial plant.
   Samuel Huntington, president of the parent company, said in a
statement that the takeover would let the new Public Service pay
its share of the costs of keeping Seabrook ready while plant owners
keep fighting for an operating license. Huntington did not explain
how that would happen.
   A spokesman for Seabrook's joint owners, David Scanzoni,
speculated that ``It would be likely that there would be some kind
of cash infusion that would be part of the arrangement'' to let the
new Public Service maintain its share of Seabrook carrying costs,
estimated at $3 million to $4 million a month.
   Scanzoni said New England Electric would want to continue
supporting Seabrook since it already owns a chunk of the plant.
   ``In many ways this a very positive step for Seabrook Station,''
Scanzoni said of the takeover talks.
   One Seabrook foe said he can't see how the takeover would let
the remaining Public Service pay Seabrook carrying costs on its own.
   ``They can't gt any revenue out of it unless they license it,''
Manchester lawyer Robert Backus noted.
   New Hampshire law bars utilities from charging ratepayers for
power plants before they operate commercially. The state Supreme
Court upheld that law on Jan. 26, denying Public Service an
emergency rate increase and forcing the utility to seek bankruptcy
protection two days later.
   A Wall Street utility analyst, Dan Scotto of L.F. Rothschild
Holdings Inc., said a takeover would make business sense for New
England Electric since aside from Seabrook, Public Service is a
profitable company.
   But ``this is not going to be clear sailing,'' Scotto said,
partly because of unresolved questions about ratemaking authority.
   Scotto also said the proposal indicates New England Electric is
showing a lack of confidence in Seabrook's prospects.
   Evacuation plans for a 10-mile zone around Seabrook must be
approved before the plant can be licensed. Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis, a Democratic presidential hopeful, has played a
key role in blocking the plant by refusing to submit plans for six
communities in his state within the zone.
   Seabrook has submitted its own plans for Massachusetts. No
hearings have been set on them yet.

<HEAD>American Standard Pressured By Sweetened Bid From Black & Decker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Standard Inc. faced intensified
takeover pressure from Black & Decker Corp. after the power-tool
maker raised its offer to $2.11 billion, but analysts began to
query whether the price was getting expensive.
   Black & Decker said Tuesday it would pay $68 a share for the
American Standard's stock, compared with $65 a share or about $2.03
billion offered previously. It was the third time Black & Decker
has raised the offer.
   Some Wall Street securities analysts were surprised and said the
price was becoming inflated for American Standard, a maker of
plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment. It has been
maneuvering to escape a takeover.
   ``They (Black & Decker) obviously see something I don't see,''
said Guy Nielsen, an analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman and Co. in
New York. ``The bidding has gotten to the point where I can't
justify the $68 price.''
   He said the bidding ``already is a bit on the rich side.''
   Others had expected Black & Decker to raise the offer or drop
the takeover attempt entirely after American Standard announced
Monday it had financing commitments for a recapitalization aimed at
thwarting the hostile bid.
   Black & Decker's latest offer, which would expire at midnight
EST March 7, compares with the initial offer of $56 a share made in
late January. The Towson, Md.-based manufacturer had said
previously it would not raise the offer above $65 a share unless it
could see American Standard's books.
   American Standard has rejected both previous offers as
inadequate. The New York-based company urged shareholders Tuesday
not to tender shares under the latest bid until it was reviewed by
the board of directors.
   American Standard stock rose 12{ cents to $68.25 a share in New
York Stock Exchange trading, while Black & Decker dipped 12{ cents
to $19.37{.
   In a news release, Black & Decker said it also intended to file
counterclaims in federal court in Delaware seeking to invalidate
American Standard's ``poison pill'' takeover defense and to halt
any action on the recapitalization.
   The $2.1 billion recapitalization plan would make American
Standard less attractive as a takeover target by boosting its
long-term debt to more than $2 billion and sharply increasing its
outstanding shares and equivalents, such as stock options.
   American Standard, incorporated in Delaware, had asked the
federal court to validate its poison pill, designed to make a
takeover prohibitively expensive by diluting the target company's
stock. The court last week rejected Black & Decker's attempt to
block American Standard from seeking such a ruling.
   Black & Decker also has challenged Delaware's new anti-takeover
law as unconstitutional.
   In addition, Black & Decker is awaiting regulatory approval to
begin a maneuver similar to a proxy fight to oust American
Standard's board of directors. If successful, Black & Decker could
repeal the recapitalization and the ``poison pill.''

<HEAD>Oil Giant Settles Old Pricing Dispute With $1.25 Billion Payment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc.'s agreement to pay the government
$1.25 billion to settle claims it overcharged customers during the
1973-81 era of price-controls removes one uncertainty confronting
the troubled oil giant, which has been under federal bankruptcy
court protection for nearly a year.
   But the third-largest U.S. oil company still faces a complicated
exit process from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, a $3 billion
payment to Pennzoil Co., a possible takeover fight with two well
known corporate raiders and a back-tax bill of up to $6.5 billion
from the Internal Revenue Service.
   Under the overcharge-dispute settlement announced Tuesday with
the Energy Department, Texaco will pay the first installment
totaling $400 million, with the rest to be paid over 5{ years. It
is one of the largest settlements ever reached between the
government and a company.
   James W. Kinnear, Texaco's president, said in a statement that
the company had set aside reserves for such a contingency and it
would have no impact on earnings.
   Kinnear also said the settlement would free Texaco from what he
called a costly and time-consuming legal process and enable the
company to concentrate its efforts on getting out of Chapter 11
federal bankruptcy protection.
   The company sought bankruptcy court refuge last April because of
its protracted legal dispute with Pennzoil, which had won a record
$10.3 billion judgment against the oil giant from a Texas jury that
ruled Texaco unfairly sabotaged Pennzoil's plan to buy part of
Getty Oil Co.
   In December Texaco settled that battle by agreeing to pay
Pennzoil $3 billion cash, but the company's efforts to return to
normal operations have been complicated by disputes over its
bankruptcy reorganization.
   In addition, the company faces a possible takeover threat from
Carl C. Icahn, the company's largest shareholder. T. Boone Pickens,
another well-known takeover strategist, also has expressed interest
in buying Texaco stock.
   Texaco's problems have been further complicated by the IRS.
Company officials said last month that the IRS had told Texaco it
may owe $6.5 billion in back taxes because of possible
undervaluations of oil purchased from Saudi Arabia from 1979-81.
   Some analysts have said Texaco would be virtually destroyed if
it had to come up with that amount, but they also speculated the
final bill would be much lower.
   The White Plains, N.Y.-based oil giant is the latest in a line
of companies forced to relinquish large sums of cash to resolve
charges they violated pricing restrictions on crude oil and refined
products during the eight-year period of federal controls.
   Jack Vandenberg, a spokesman for the Department of Energy in
Washington, said prior to the Texaco settlement, it received about
$6.1 billion in settlement funds. He said the department expects to
collect about $1 billion more to resolve similar claims, bringing
the total to $8.2 billion.
   The government had argued that during the era of price controls,
companies illegally profited by classifying ``old'' oil _ obtained
from properties producing before 1973 _ as ``new'' oil and selling
it at higher prices.
   Texaco had argued that federal regulations defining old and new
oil were ambiguous, but said Tuesday that challenging the
government on this dispute was not worth the effort.
   Vandenberg said about 15 percent of the $1.25 billion settlement
covered refined product price violations, with the money destined
to go into a fund to repay injured parties.
   The remaining 85 percent covers crude price violations, and a
fifth of that will go into the injured party fund and the rest will
be split evenly between the federal government and the states, he
said.
   Late last year, the Department of Energy extended the deadline
for injured parties to file claims to June 30. More than 16,000
claims had been filed before the extension.
   The agency said at that time that a claim for a million gallons
of refined products overcharged would mean about $800 coming to the
claimant.
   Most of the injured parties are businesses, school districts and
municipalities that kept detailed records of crude oil and refined
products purchased from oil concerns that the government accused of
overcharging.
   Other companies that have paid to settle complaints include
Exxon Corp., Amoco Corp., Shell Oil Co., Mobil Corp. and Atlantic
Richfield Co.

<HEAD>Ford Says Help From Workers Key to Successful Livonia Expansion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET BRAUNSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LIVONIA, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. said it was able to expand
its largest automatic transmission plant without interrupting
production and at less than half the cost of similar projects
because of worker participation.
   ``It truly was a team approach. Each plant area analyzed how the
expansion and quality improvements could be achieved. Issues were
discussed openly and plans were refined to reflect the suggestions
of each team,'' Henry Nickol, general manager of Ford's
transmission and chassis division, said Tuesday.
   The $50 million project added 100,000 units to the plant's
795,000 yearly transmission production while improving quality and
saving 190 jobs without interrupting the assembly line, Ford said.
   The expansion has helped ease a shortage of automatic
transmissions for rear-wheel-drive cars and trucks, particularly
Ford's popular F-series pickup, that use 4.9-liter, six-cylinder
engines and 5.0-liter V-8 engines.
   The F-series pickup was the best-selling vehicle in the United
States in 1986 and 1987, but Ford was forced to offer incentives to
boost sales of manual transmission trucks because it didn't have
enough automatic transmissions, company spokesman Rex Greenslade
said.
   Greenslade said a comparable transmission plant expansion would
have cost $100 million to $150 million.
   Nickol's remarks reflect what has become cliche at Ford, where
top executives never note a new profit, sales or quality
achievement without crediting hourly workers and their cooperation
with management.
   But the employees, hourly and salaried, who have worked together
on the project since September 1986 and who will live with its
results, say it proves that cooperative management is more than a
1980s buzzword.
   ``It's certainly the way we'll go from now on, on any new
program,'' said Jim O'Neill, the Livonia Transmission plant's
manufacturing manager.
   O'Neill said the expansion saved jobs that would have been cut
if efficiency had improved but total production did not.

<HEAD>Finance Ministry Council Seeks Tighter Laws Against Insider
Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Finance Ministry committee Wednesday approved a
report calling for tougher laws against insider trading on Japan's
stock markets, where traders say information about companies
frequently is leaked to selected investors.
   The ministry's Securities and Exchange Council approved an
advisory panel's findings, including a recommendation that insider
trading be made a criminal rather than a civil offense. It proposed
that the offense carry a penalty of up to three years in prison and
a fine of up to 3 million yen, or $23,000, ministry officials said.
   The panel also called for a revision of Japan's current
securities and exchange law to specifically prohibit insider
trading, or the use of inside information about companies to profit
on stock markets.
   Other recommendations called for an expansion of the ministry's
investigation powers and a tightening of the definition of actions
falling under insider trading laws, the officials said.
   Ministry officials now will formulate legislation based on the
panel's recommendations to submit to Japan's parliament, probably
this spring.
   Large-scale insider trading is limited in Japan because of the
infrequency of corporate takeovers, analysts say. But leaks of
information about company developments to certain investors is
believed to be frequent, along with stock manipulation by some
large brokerages, financial sources say.
   Japan's markets are dominated by four large securities firms _
Nomura, Nikko, Daiwa and Yamaichi _ creating a climate favorable to
market manipulation.
   The advisory panel began forming its recommendations about two
months ago, after allegations of stock sales by officials at a
chemical company shortly before it announced bankruptcy, news
reports said.
   Implementation of the recommendations will make Japan the last
major industrialized country to adopt such regulations, the Japan
Broadcasting Corp. (NHK-TV) reported.
   The panel said insider trading restrictions should apply to
employees and others inside companies that issue stocks, to
underwriting securities firms, lawyers and certified public
accountants, and to reporters that have access to sensitive
information.
   The report also recommended that securities firms be required to
report the stock ownership of large stockholders.
   The changes are not likely to take effect before the summer of
1989 because of a one-year notice period necessary for the
strengthened criminal penalties, officials said.

<HEAD>Barclays' Profit Plummets 70 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barclays Bank PLC, one of Britain's four major
commercial banks, said Wednesday that its 1987 profit plummeted
70.8 percent, largely because it raised its provisions for loans to
Latin American and other countries.
   Barclays said it earned 185 million pounds, or $327 million last
year, compared with 633 million pounds, or $1.12 billion, in 1986.
Included in the 1986 figure was a one-time gain of 21 million
pounds, or $37 million, from the disposal of certain assets.
   On a per-share basis, that works out to 25.8 pence, or 46 cents,
a share, vs. 88.9 pence, or $1.57, a share in the previous year.
   Last summer, Barclays raised its provisions against loans to
lesser developed countries to 30 percent of its total loans
outstanding, then increased that stake at the end of the year.
   As of Dec. 31, its total provisions stood at 716 million pounds,
or $1.27 billion _ 35 percent of the bank's total 2.026 billion
pounds, or $3.59 billion, outstanding.
   ``The results achieved in our group operations through the year
reflect a credible performance,'' said Chairman John Quinton.
``Even though we decided to recognize the further deterioration in
the quality of LDC debt by making further provisions, the impact on
our capital has been comfortably absorbed.''
   Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the bank's investment banking
subsidiary, reported a loss of 11 million pounds, or $19 million,
for the year, compared with a profit of 1 million pounds, or $1.77
million, the year before.
   Barclays said the unit was profitable up to October and in the
final two months of the year, but that trading losses suffered
during the crash pushed it into the red.
   The unit announced last November that it lost 50 million pounds,
or $89 million, during the crash.
   Profits from Barclays' U.S. unit were hurt by the fall of the
dollar.
   The bank said profit grew 14 percent in dollar terms, but only
1.6 percent in terms of pounds _ to 64 million pounds, compared
with 63 million.

   The stock market edged upward today, bidding to
resume its recent rally after a pause on Tuesday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 6.14 to 2,045.26 in
the first half hour.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in the overall tally
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 557 up, 480 down and
480 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 27.08 million shares as of 10 a.m. on
Wall Street.
   Analysts said confidence has slowly been recovering lately after
the market's historic drop last fall.
   The economy has so far shown no signs of suffering any drastic
harm from the crash, and interest rates have fallen since that time.
   But traders have been taking a gingerly approach, recalling how
gains built up over many months were wiped out in a few short days
in October.
   Many Wall Streeters are watching to see whether the Dow Jones
industrial average can surpass the 2,051.89 close it reached on
Jan. 7, which stands as its post-crash closing high.
   Stop & Shop gained 1~ to 41 in active trading. The company,
opposing a $37-a-share takeover bid by Dart Group, said it is
talking with several other parties about a possible deal.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.13 to 148.86. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .18 at 282.90.
   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average slipped 1.17 to
2,039.12.
   Advancing issues outpaced losers by a narrow margin on the NYSE,
with 767 up, 725 down and 493 unchanged. Big Board volume rose to
192.26 million shares from 178.93 million shares on Monday.

<HEAD>Greenspan Sees Signs Of Strength, Factory Orders Down For Big

<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 7 grafs to UPDATE with fourth-quarter trade
deficit figures; uppicks 3rd graf pvs: The new...</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's foreign trade deficit edged down to $40.2 billion
in the final three months of 1987, pressured lower by a 6 percent
boost in U.S. overseas sales, the Commerce Department reported
today.
   In the previous quarter, the gap had hit a record $40.4 billion,
while the year finished with an overall record $159.3 billion
deficit, calculated on a balance-of-payments basis.
   The new figures confirmed a yearend narrowing of the trade
shortfall that already had shown up in the department's monthly
merchandise trade reports.
   Those parallel figures showed a $43 billion deficit for the
fourth quarter and a $171.9 deficit for all of 1987.
   Today's figures are smaller because they subtract factors such
as the cost of shipping, insurance and military sales from the
monthly numbers.
   The balance-of-payments deficit is also adjusted for seasonal
variations, while the monthly merchandise figures are not.
   Exports increased $3.9 billion, or 6 percent, in the final
quarter of 1987, to $69.1 billion, bolstered by the weakening
dollar, which made U.S. goods more price-competitive overseas.
   The report came one day after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said he did not forsee a recession or heightened
inflation this year.
   Greenspan made his assessment in testimony Tuesday before
Congress, where he appeared unperturbed by a Commerce Department
report that orders for so-called ``big ticket'' American-made
durable goods fell 2.8 percent in January.
   The Fed chief, who wields enormous control over interest rates
and the supply of money, said the risk of a recession is about
equal to the risk of renewed inflation, but he agreed with the
Reagan administration that neither appears imminent.
   The remarks by the head of the nation's central bank were seen
as inconclusive by the financial markets.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials lost 1.17 points to
2,039.12, while the price of the key 30-year Treasury bond rose
about $7.50 for every $1,000 in face value. The dollar was lower
against most major foreign currencies.
   The decline in orders to U.S. factories for durable goods
reflected a return to more normal levels of demand for aircraft and
primary metals, the Commerce Department said.
   The steep decline, only the third setback in the past 13 months,
was the biggest since an 8 percent drop in January 1987. The latest
figures followed a big December advance of 4.1 percent, the
strongest rise since March.
   ``The numbers that were released on durable goods, if one
subtracts some of the temporary fluctuations, were really quite
strong,'' Greenspan said during an appearance before the House
Banking Committee.
   Delivering the Fed's semi-annual report on monetary policy to
Congress, Greenspan took pointed exception to the economic
philosophies espoused by chief White House economist Beryl Sprinkel.
   If the Fed had let the nation's money supply grow to the extent
Sprinkel would have liked, it would have spawned an ``unduly
inflationary environment,'' Greenspan told the House committee.
   Analysts suggested that Greenspan's testimony did not signal any
imminent Fed action on interest rates.
   ``He left himself a lot of room to either tighten or loosen,''
said David Wyss, chief financial economist for Data Resources Inc.
Wyss said there are signs ``that the Fed does not know what it
wants to do yet. It is seeing some very conflicting signals from
the economy and it wants to leave itself as much room to react as
it can.''

   The battle for IU International Corp. has
intensified with the company's board of directors first endorsing a
$21.50-a-share buyout from a group backed by Dean Witter Capital
Corp., then Neoax Inc. raising its hostile bid.
   The board announced Tuesday that it had accepted a cash offer
totaling around $650 million from the Dean Witter Group, but
shortly after Neoax sweetened its bid to $22 a share.
   After that occurred, IU issued a statement saying it would
consider other alternatives.
   ``Shareholders will be advised of the board's recommendations
when the board has completed its review.'' said IU spokesman E.K.
Sheldon, refusing to elaborate.
   Neoax, a Stamford, Conn., manufacturing conglomerate, has been
trying since early January to take over Philadelphia-based IU,
which has interests in trucking, food services and waste management.
   Neoax started the bidding on Jan. 6 with an offer of $17.50 per
share, increased it to $19 on Jan. 17 and boosted it to $20 on Feb.
1.
   IU's board suggested shareholders ignore the $20 IU offer,
saying the board was exploring alternatives such as
recapitalization or a leveraged buyout.
   In the agreement between IU and the Dean Witter group, which
includes IU President William H. Waltrip and other IU executives,
Dean Witter would receive up to $15 million from IU if another
bidder acquires a majority of the outstanding shares.
   Neoax, which has acquired about 2.9 million of IU's 30.2 million
shares outstanding, has filed a motion in federal court in
Baltimore seeking to stop payment of that fee.

   A federal judge's landmark ruling
that Occidental Chemical Corp. was liable for the cost of cleaning
up Love Canal strengthens anti-pollution laws nationwide, a federal
official says.
   After nine years' deliberations, Judge John Curtin ruled Tuesday
that Occidental was responsible because wastes generated by the
company's plant were stored in a way that would eventually result
in leakage.
   A trial expected to start in 1990 will determine the amount of
damages, but state and federal officials say $200 million has
already been spent on the cleanup and estimate that $50 million
more will be required.
   The judge ruled in a 1979 lawsuit filed by the federal
Environmental Protection Agency. In 1978, earlier, toxic chemicals
at Love Canal prompted state officials to evacuate children and
pregnant women, and eventually 728 families. Of those, 175 families
are still waiting to learn whether it is safe to return.
   Curtin's ruling upheld the federal Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980. The judge said
that law was designed to compel the waste disposal industry ``to
correct its past mistakes and to provide a solution for the dangers
posed by inactive abandoned waste sites.''
   ``This will strengthen environmental laws throughout the
country,'' Roger J. Marzulla, head of the U.S. Justice Department's
Land and Natural Resources Division, said in Washington.
   Frank Ashley, a spokesman for Occidental's parent company,
Occidental Petroleum, based in Los Angeles, said the company did
not agree with the decision and would appeal.
   ``The decision which has just been issued on partial summary
judgment, without a trial and without any factual determination,
that Occidental had acted negligently or with fault contradicts the
resolution of these problems by amicable adjustments reached in
other actions involving Occidental Chemical Corp.,'' Ashley said.
   The law entitles a judge to determine the issue of liability,
and the next stage of the case is a trial to determine the amount
of damages, said Martin Littlefield, assistant U.S. attorney for
the Buffalo district.
   In its motions, Occidental had challenged that procedure.
   About 1,300 former residents of the Love Canal neighborhood
accepted a $20 million damage settlement with Occidental in 1984.
   The eventual amount Occidental pays will depend on costs proved
in court and assessed by the judge. U.S. Attorney Roger Williams'
staff said that $200 million has been spent so far and it is
estimated that there will be $50 million more in costs.
   Lois Gibbs, a former Love Canal resident who runs the Citizen's
Clearing House for Hazardous Wastes in Alexandria, Va., said she
hopes the company will be found liable for the full $250 million.
   ``That will at least make them blink,'' Gibbs said.
   The company said it was covered by insurance and that the
expenses would not adversely affect its finances.
   Occidental contended that it was not responsible for the
landfill because Hooker Chemicals and Plastics Co., which was later
acquired by Occidental in 1968, yielded ownership to the Niagara
Falls School Board in 1953. The board built a school on the grounds.
   Occidental said the construction project broke a clay seal on
the dump and allowed the chemicals to leach into the environment.
The company acknowledged that Hooker dumped 20,000 tons of chemical
wastes into the canal during the late 1940s and early '50s.
   Littlefield, assistant U.S. attorney for the Buffalo district,
said Tuesday's decision was ``a great victory for the state because
it means companies are indeed responsible for what they've done in
years past.''
   State Attorney General Robert Abrams said the decision was ``a
resounding defeat for Occidental's strenuous and expensive public
relations campaign to shift the entire blame for Love Canal.''
   Curtin's ruling does, however, allow Occidental to sue other
parties the chemical giant contends should share the
responsibility. The company is expected to countersue the state,
the city of Niagara Falls and its school board.
   Nunzio Loverdi, president of the Love Canal Environmental Action
Committee, said, ``I think Occidental should accept the decision
and not take action against the city and school board because if it
does we will all suffer. We want to get on with our lives and put
this behind us.''

<HEAD>Black & Decker Rebuffed In Delaware Law Challenge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has rejected Black &
Decker Corp.'s request to block Delaware's new corporate
anti-takeover law, but did not rule on the constitutionality of the
statute.
   U.S. District Judge Joseph J. Longobardi on Tuesday rejected
Black & Decker's request for an injunction against the law, which
it contended was hindering its attempt to acquire American Standard
Corp.
   Black & Decker, a power tool and household appliance maker based
in Towson, Md., has a hostile $68 a share, or $2.12 billion, tender
offer outstanding for American Standard, which is based in New York
but incorporated in Delaware.
   American Standard had rejected two previous Black & Decker
offers, and proposed a defensive recapitalization that analysts
have valued at between $68 and $71 a share.
   American Standard rose 50 cents to $68.75 a share in early New
York Stock Exchange trading. Black & Decker dipped 50 cents to
$18.87{.
   Delaware's new anti-takeover law was enacted on Feb. 2, and
immediately was challenged as unconstitutional by Black & Decker..
   Black & Decker also claimed shareholders of American Standard,
an air-conditioning, plumbing and building products company, were
confused by the law and reluctant to tender their shares.
   But Longobardi rejected the request for an injunction. He ruled
Black & Decker hadn't shown it would suffer irreparable harm under
the law, and therefore would not rule on its constitutionality.
   ``Such a gratuitous discussion of the constitutionality of (the
statute) could be used to upset the balance between the parties in
the quest for their respective positions,'' Longobardi said of the
takeover battle.
   The court also noted that Black & Decker was attempting to take
control of the American Standard board, and if successful then
could exempt the company from the law.
   The boards of directors of Delaware corporations have 90 days
from the law's enactment to exempt their companies.
   Under the law, any shareholder who acquires more than 15 percent
of a company's stock is prohibited for three years from entering a
business combination that would allow the stockholder to acquire
the firm.
   If a takeover is launched before the law is triggered, the
bidder would have to acquire 85 percent of the outstanding shares
in a single transaction to complete the merger.
   John F. Geer, vice president of American Standard, said the
company was ``gratified'' by the decision. Richard L. Templeton,
Delaware's assistant secretary of state, said he was ``encouraged
by the decision.''

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
today that he had ``objected quite strongly'' to an instance of
political pressure from the Reagan administration and warned that
further pressure on the central bank could be counterproductive.
   Greenspan said his protest was sparked by a letter written in
January by Michael Darby, assistant Treasury secretary for economic
affairs.
   Greenspan was questioned about the letter by Sen. William
Proxmire, D-Wis., who said the letter was one of a series of recent
attempts by the Reagan administration to pressure the Fed to lower
interest rates as a way of spurring economic growth during a
presidential election year.
   ``I think it is both deplorable and counterproductive for the
Reagan administration to pressure you as much as they have in
recent months,'' Proxmire, the chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, told Greenspan.
   Greenspan said that he had a disagreement with both Darby and
Beryl Sprinkel, the president's chief economic adviser, over the
matter of money growth.
   He said that while disagreements over policy were acceptable he
was concerned about the manner in which the administration's
criticism could be perceived by financial markets.
   ``When I heard about Dr. Darby's letter I objected quite
strongly. As best as I could determine, he was not aware of the
implications,'' Greenspan said. ``I am reasonably sure such an
action will not occur in the future.''
   Greenspan said his concern was that the letter was sent in the
weeks before a key meeting where top Fed officials were going to
set monetary targets for the next year.
   Greenspan did not say with whom he raised his objections,
although it has been reported that Treasury Secretary James Baker
was instrumental in toning down criticism of the Fed in the
economic report of the president before it was released last week.
   Greenspan said he fully expected to have policy disputes with
this administration and the next administration, but he added,
``The only thing I hope that does not happen is that the concern
over political pressure gets so extraordinary that we end up taking
actions'' in the opposite direction just to prove that the Fed is
independent.
   Greenspan's comments on political pressure came during the
second day of his congressional testimony on the Fed's economic
outlook and monetary targets for 1988.
   In his appearance Tuesday before the House Banking Committee,
Greenspan had also been critical of Sprinkel's monetary arguments.
   In the president's report, Sprinkel suggested that tight-fisted
Fed policies were partly to blame for the collapse of the stock
market on Oct. 19.
   Sprinkel is a proponent of ``monetarism,'' the theory that
steady growth in the money supply is esential to economic growth.
The president's report noted that the money supply expanded very
slowly last year, below the targets set by the Federal Reserve.
   One measure of the money supply, M-2, grew just 4 percent in
1987, the slowest increase in almost three decades. The advance was
even below the rate of inflation, something that has occurred only
three previous times. In each of those instances, a recession
followed.
   Asked about this, Greenspan contended that money growth was
influenced by special factors last year and that traditional
relationships between money growth and economic activity have
broken down since banking deregulation created a host of new types
of savings accounts.
   Greenspan said that he and Sprinkel had a ``difference of
opinion on this particular issue.'' He argued that the central bank
could not have allowed the money supply to grow more rapidly
``without creating an unduly inflationary environment.''
   Private economists generally gave Greenspan high marks for his
testimony, contending that he steered the proper course between
concern about inflation and concern about economic growth.
   In setting monetary targets for 1988, the Fed expanded the
distance between the low-point and high-point of acceptable growth
by a full percentage point, saying it was now aiming for M-2 growth
of between 4 percent and 8 percent.
   This money growth will be enough to support economic growth this
year of between 2 percent and 2.5 percent, as measured by the gross
national product, the Fed said in its economic outlook. This would
be in the range of the 2.4 percent GNP growth being forecast by the
administration.
   ``Greenspan left himself a lot of room to ither tighten or
loosen,'' said David Wyss, chief financial economist of Data
Resources Inc. ``The Fed is seeing some very conflicting signals
about the economy and it wants to leave itself as much room to
react as it can.''
   Greenspan confirmed in his testimony that the Fed, in an effort
to keep the recovery alive, had taken a ``small easing step a few
weeks ago.'' Many analysts had suggested that the Fed had eased
slightly based on the fact that a variety of interest rates,
including mortgage rates, have dropped sharply in the past six
weeks.
   Greenspan said that currently he believed the risks of a
recession or accelerating inflation were about equal and said he
agreed with the administration's view that neither appeared
imminent.
   He said that it was still too early to assess the full impact of
last year's stock market collapse but ``there are very few signs
that we are about to tilt over'' into a recession.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly
higher but quickly turned mixed today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Talk of new Soviet purchases of U.S. corn gave corn futures a
boost, analysts said.
   Wheat and soybean futures were pressured by follow-through
selling from Tuesday's weaker close, but losses were limited by
scattered commercial buying, said Dale Gustafson, an analyst for
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New York.
   Beneficial rains in the soybean-growing areas of South America
added to the weakness in U.S. bean futures, Gustafson said.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 2\ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in March at $3.16{ a bushel; corn was 2

   The stock market churned in place today,
struggling to resume its recent rally after a pause on Tuesday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials eked out a .50 gain to
2,039.62 by noontime on Wall Street.
   But losers slightly outnumbered gainers in the overall tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 629 up, 673 down and
504 unchanged.
   Analysts said confidence has slowly been recovering lately after
the market's historic drop last fall.
   The economy has so far shown no signs of suffering any drastic
harm from the crash, and interest rates have fallen since that time.
   But traders have been taking a gingerly approach, recalling how
gains built up over many months were wiped out in a few short days
in October.
   Many Wall Streeters are watching to see whether the Dow Jones
industrial average can surpass the 2,051.89 close it reached on
Jan. 7, which stands as its post-crash closing high.
   Coastal Corp. was actively traded, down ~ at 29[. Underwriters

<HEAD>GM to Restore 1,900 Jobs at California Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. said today it will
restore 1,900 jobs at its Van Nuys, Calif., plant on March 14 by
putting both shifts back to work six weeks earlier than expected.
   The announcement came as GM indicated it will be recalling about
8,600 workers nationwide to produce an extra 175,000 cars and
trucks annually.
   The night shift at the Van Nuys plant was elminated Feb. 15
because GM had too much unsold inventory of the Pontiac Firebirds
and Chevrolet Camaros assembled there.
   At the time, GM said it expected the plant would operate with
only one shift until at least May 2 or until the inventory was
reduced.
   In a unique experiment that had run into stiff resistance among
senior workers, all 3,800 of the plant's hourly workers were
affected, with half being off for two weeks at a time, then
returning to their jobs while the others were furloughed for two
weeks.
   The staggered-layoff system was to have continued at least until
May 2, or longer if necessary, GM said.
   Similar systems of staggered layoffs have been tested elsewhere
in the GM system, but at Van Nuys the plan had to be approved in a
vote by workers.
   The vote was required because when the workers agreed in 1986 to
adopt Japanese-style work rules to speed production and cut costs,
the company agreed to negotiate with the union to ease any impact
from changes in staffing levels.
   In an initial vote, the plan was defeated by eight votes, but
after some maneuvering the union agreed to hold a second vote and
to do it at the plant so more workers with less seniority could
cast ballots. The plan was approved on the second vote, despite
grumbling by older workers that making all workers take part in the
furloughs was an attack on seniority rights.
   The Camaros and Firebirds produced at the Van Nuys plant have
been plagued for some time with slow sales. When GM announced plans
for the layoffs earlier this year, the company's inventory of the
two cars was well in excess of 100 days, meaning it would take that
long at existing sales rates to dispose of already-assembled cars.
   Normally, GM operates with about a 60-day inventory on its
various models.
   With both shifts operating, the Van Nuys plant produces about
800 of the two car models daily.

   United Mine Workers President Richard Trumka said
today he's disappointed by the decision by Oil, Chemical and Atomic
Workers union officials to withdraw from a proposed merger and said
he considers the idea dead.
   ``We thought it was a perfect fit,'' Trumka said. ``The
philosophies of the two unions are extremely close.''
   Trumka said the UMW's executive board voted to rescind its
merger offer in the wake of Tuesday's OCAW decision.
   ``Obviously, I'm quite disappointed by the outcome ... but we're
going to go back and put it back together and go on,'' he said.
   He said the UMW will look for other ways to expand.
   Trumka said the apparent sticking point for the OCAW board was
the UMW's inability to guarantee there would be no dues increases
during its next regularly scheduled constitutional convention in
1990.
   Trumka said he cannot control what the delegates will do ``and
therefore I consider it a closed deal.''
   The OCAW board voted late Tuesday to reject the merger proposal.
   ``There's a decision from OCAW not to go forward,'' spokesman
Rod Rogers said late Tuesday night. ``I don't know that that sets
everything in concrete. But that's where it stands for now.''
   A news conference had been tentatively set for this morning to
announce the merger, but the OCAW backed out after meeting with UMW
leaders most of Tuesday afternoon.
   The merger would have bolstered the strength of the two energy
workers' unions, whose memberships have been shrinking throughout
the last decade.
   The UMW board has authority to approve a merger without a vote
of its full membership, though Rogers said any merger required a
two-thirds majority vote at the OCAW convention in August.
   The UMW and the OCAW find themselves negotiating with the same
companies, ``because the major oil companies own the lion's share
of the energy and coal reserves in the United States,'' Rogers said.
   Since 1986, the two unions have been sharing information about
employers.
   The UMW once had more than 400,000 members, but it now has about
85,000 active members _ about two-thirds of the nation's working
miners.
   OCAW membership is down by half from a peak of nearly 200,000
members in the early 1970s.

<HEAD>New Waves Of Knowledge Aid Search For Oil And Gas</HEAD>

   The computers and high technology now used to
search for oil and gas would have been a mystery to Anthony Lucas,
who relied largely on a hunch to drill the famed 1901 Spindletop
gusher.
   ``There was almost no science at Spindletop,'' says Dave
Kingston, a retired Standard Oil of New Jersey geologist. ``Today,
it's just the reverse. We want to know all we can (about a
prospect) before we drill.''
   Using stunning advances in geology, geochemistry and other
disciplines, oilmen now analyze a broad range of information in
searching for unfound storehouses of Earth's most crucial commodity.
   ``There's no way to relate today to what we had in the past,''
says Houston oilman Michel Halbouty. ``The technology has changed
every day of every year that the industry has been alive.''
   Central to nearly all the developments has been the increasing
use of computers to sift, store and massage massive amounts of data.
   Among other things, computers can generate three-dimensional
views of prospective drill sites based on information from rock
samples, previous drilling and other sources, creating hypothetical
composite pictures of what lies below grassy, forested or desert
surfaces.
   ``In the past, the same process has been done with pencil and
paper,'' said Richard D. Bowden, spokesman for Energy Software Inc.
of Midland. ``It's like comparing the Wright Brothers to the
Concorde _ it's the same kind of advance.''
   Advances in seismic technology have also aided the search for
oil, says Don Bennett, divisional vice president of exploration and
production technology division of Texaco Inc.
   By measuring the movement of seismic shock waves through the
Earth, scientists can derive clues as to whether the waves are
traveling through rock, sand or, possibly, unfound oil formations.
   Since 1968, when plate tectonics _ the theory that Earth's
surface is composed of massive shifting rock plates _ became widely
accepted, dramatic advances in geology have been made.
   ``What plate tectonics does, instead of just hunt and peck here
and there, you now have a unifying theory about how these plates
were formed,'' said Manik Talwani, director of the Geotechnology
Research Institute in Houston. ``It helps you very much in your
guessing about which might be good oil provinces.''
   In addition, developments in the complicated science of
geochemistry have provided clues to locating oil through testing
sample rocks in the laboratory, as have improvements in sensing
equipment lowered into drill holes to conduct electrical and other
analyses.
   Patrick Shannon, another retired Standard Oil of New Jersey
geologist, now runs his own consulting firm specializing in
analyzing satellite photos of Earth for telltale signs of oil and
gas deposits.
   In addition to being able to see large structural features that
could hint of oil and gas, different kinds of rock and minerals
often respond differently to varying light and infrared
frequencies, Shannon says.
   ``The use of those (satellite photos) is among the most
important new technologies that we've got in the business today,''
Shannon said, adding that future satellites may provide even more
sophisticated data.
   Most experts agree oil and gas exploration remains a risky
business fraught with the potential for failure, and new techniques
only help to create a more comprehensive mosaic of information for
decision-making.
   ``It's like putting together a jigsaw puzzle,'' Burnett said.
``You want to get as many pieces as possible.''
   One reason for burgeoning technology in oil exploration has been
the huge increase in drilling costs, which have risen sharply over
the past 20 years, Halbouty says.
   What's more, most of the biggest deposits of oil and gas in the
United States have already been found, making discoveries of
smaller, more isolated remaining pockets more difficult, and more
important, said Mel Friedman, spokesman for the department of
geosciences at Texas A&M University.
   In 1901, Lucas decided to drill the Spindletop gusher on a small
hill where he and others suspected oil might exist, but where a
number of unsuccessful wells had been drilled.
   When the drillers hit a huge reserve of oil, a gusher of black
gold shot hundreds of feet into the air, igniting the legendary
Texas oil boom.
   During the 1950s and 1960s, Kingston and Shannon roamed the
globe as geologists for Standard Oil using what might now be
considered rudimentary tools and techniques.
   Kingston takes a somewhat skeptical view of many advances.
   ``The same guy who finds oil with a computer is the same guy who
can find oil without the computer,'' Kingston said. ``A geologist
with his hammer and his eyes and his brain is far superior to
anything else.
   ``Today, there are about 150 kinds of maps and studies that can
be run in a certain area to study the geology, but there are only
10 or 12 that are really necessary,'' Kingston said. ``The rest are
just window dressing.''
   For Kingston, technology can only aid human intuition, which
remains the primary key to finding hidden treasure troves of oil
and gas.
   ``An analogy would be reading a mystery novel with half the
pages torn out, you have to guess about what is in there,''
Kingston said.

   A group of shareholders of Societe
Generale de Belgique SA said Wednesday it has formed an alliance
that holds a majority stake in Belgium's largest holding company
and wants to keep its focus in Belgium.
   The group, which includes representation from Belgium, France
and Luxembourg, said it controlled 52 percent of Societe Generale
stock.
   Italian financier Carlo De Benedetti, the president of Olivetti
SpA, whotrols 43 percent, wants to turn the company
into that controls enterprises throughout Europe.
   The shareholder alliance consists of several Belgian and

The
group's French members are Compagnie Financiere de Suez, an
investment firm, Companie Generale d'Electricite and Societe
Financiere et Industrielle Gaz et Eaux.
   Suez alone controls 27 percent; Groupe AG and its allies, 16
percent; CGE, 5 percent and Gaz et Eaux, 4 percent, the group said
in a statement.
   On Wednesday, Societe Generale stock closed at a new high of
6,100 francs, or $174.20, up 14 percent from Tuesday's 5,350
francs, or $152.90.
   De Benedetti has offered 4,000 francs, or $114.28, a share for
an additional 15 percent stake in the company. His offer expires
March 4.
   His rival alliance said its members had ``put their signatur38, arrived

Adzima, of Sudbury. ``I took off this afternoon to see if
Springsteen was hanging around. When I heard the music, I said,
`That's Bruce.'''
   Springsteen last played at the Centrum in September 1984.

   Aidan Quinn, who stars in the Broadway revival
of ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' says he's not worried about
filling the shoes _ or torn T-shirt _ of Marlon Brando.
   The 1947 production of Tennessee Williams' Pulitzer
Prize-winning play was Brando's first major theatrical role. The
film that followed, also featuring Brando as Stanley Kowalski, is
``etched into everyone's psyche and memory,'' Quinn admitted in the

   ``But that's a real cowardly reason not to do something,'' says
Quinn, who starred in the film ``Desperately Seeking Susan,'' the
made-for-TV movie ``An Early Frost,'' and the off-Broadway

   ``The truth is it's a great piece, a great play and a great
role.''
   The play, now in previews, opens March 10.

   Wearing a rumpled oversize tuxedo and
shoes without laces, comedian Steve Martin jumped up and down like
a game-show contestant when he received the Hasty Pudding Club Man
of the Year award.
   ``I won! I won!'' he said to the delight of the audience of
nearly 200 at Harvard University. When he reached the podium,
Martin deadpanned, ``There's a cash prize for this, right?''
   He received a brass pudding pot, but no cash.
   The nation's oldest undergraduate theatrical organization gave
its annual award Tuesday to Martin for ``his lasting and impressive
contribution to the world of entertainment,'' said program
co-producer Andrea Campbell.
   Martin said receiving the award made up for his movie
``Roxanne'' not being nominated for an Oscar. ``Yes it does,
because it's such a prestigious award, and so few people have
gotten one,'' he said.
   The Hasty Pudding Club awarded Lucille Ball its Woman of the
Year award last week.

   Tammy Faye Bakker wants Oscar-winner Sally
Field to play her in a made-for-TV film about the saga of her and
husband Jim Bakker's fall from grace as leaders of the PTL
evangelical ministry, a network official says.
   NBC has hired the Bakkers as consultants for its movie. CBS also
plans a film about the couple.
   ``If Tammy had her way, Sally Field would play her in the
movie,'' said Ken Raskoff, director of motion pictures for
television at NBC.
   Both NBC's film, ``Fall From Grace,'' and the CBS movie ``God
and Greed: The Jim and Tammy Fae Bakker Story,'' are in early
stages of production. Both networks say it will be three months
before a first draft is ready.
   ``Looks like we are going to have a
`who's-going-to-get-on-the-air' thing,'' said Sandy Emry,
production coordinator at CBS.
   Jim Bakker resigned from the PTL television ministry in March
after word leaked of a 1980 sexual encounter with former church
secretary Jessica Hahn.

   Author Ken Kesey has donated a $33,395 bus
to the University of Oregon, with the hope of preventing accidents
like the one that killed his son and another member of the school
wrestling team four years ago.
   ``The problem with a van is that it's not as stable as school
bus construction,'' said Kesey, who gained fame two decades ago for
his escapades on a very different kind of bus, whose journeys were
chronicled in Tom Wolfe's ``The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test.''
Kesey himself is best known for his novel, ``One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest.''
   Kesey's son, Jed, 20, and fellow wrestler Lorenzo West died when
their van skidded out of control on a snow-covered road between
Pendleton and Pullman, Wash. Two other wrestlers were seriously
injured.
   Kesey and his wife, Faye, were among those who filed lawsuits in
which settlements were reached last fall. The Keseys used their
settlement to purchase the custom-built bus, which is loaded with
safety features.

   Historian Stephen Ambrose, writing the
second volume of his biography about Richard M. Nixon, says
students today don't see anything so horrible about Watergate.
   The New Orleans historian recently wrapped up a three-week visit
to Whittier College, Nixon's alma mater. Ambrose, 52, brought in
former Nixon administration officials H.R. Haldeman, Robert Finch
and Maurice Stans to add to his lectures.
   ``I suppose I had assumed that just being at Whittier, they
(students) would have absorbed something about Nixon. It turned
out, precious little,'' he said. Because students ``don't see
anything so horrible about Watergate'' there is a national
resurgence of Nixon's reputation.
   ``It's the damnedest thing, but it's quite true. The Nixon
revival is full-blown now and well under way,'' Ambrose said.

   Share prices edged higher in thin trading
Wednesday, bringing an end to a strong two-day advance.
   Dealers attributed the session's dullness to a lack of
market-affecting news and uninspiring performances on Wall Street
on Tuesday and early Wednesday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 2.2
points, or 0.1 percent, higher at 1,760.1.
   Volume declined to a light 338.1 million shares from 474.1
million shares traded Tuesday.
   Dealers said business was slack as many investors waited for
Monday's data on Britain's balance of payments for January. They
also were waiting for Thursday's announcement of fourth-quarter
earnings from Imperial Chemical Industries PLC. The giant chemical
company's earnings are viewed as an unofficial indicator of the
state of British industry, dealers said.

   General Motors Corp. said Wednesday it boosted
1988 production plans by 175,000 cars and trucks and will recall
8,600 laid-off workers and reopen a temporarily closed assembly
plant.
   ``The strengthening demand for GM vehicles reflects the ongoing
product quality improvements resulting from plant modernization and
employee involvement programs,'' GM President Robert Stempel said
in a statement.
   ``This combined with very competitive retail incentive programs
has increased the value of GM products,'' he said.
   GM will increase production by running some plants, particularly
for trucks, on overtime; restoring second shifts at two U.S. plants
and one in Canada; and reopening its closed Framingham, Mass.,
assembly plant.
   At the three plants where GM had dropped the second shift,
workers from both shifts were sharing jobs by alternating between
two weeks on layoff and two weeks on the job, GM said.
   The Framingham assembly plant, which GM closed abruptly Nov. 30,
will reopen May 9 on one shift with 2,000 of its 3,700 workers. The
plant will build the Oldsmobile Cutlass Cierra, but will not resume
production of the Chevrolet Celebrity, GM spokeswoman Kathy Tanner
said.
   GM will restore the second shift at its
Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac Group Lansing assembly plant A-system on
April 11, returning 2,000 people to full-time work. The
4,350-worker plants builds the Oldsmobile Cutlass Calais and Buick
Skylark.
   The second shift at GM's 4,200-worker Van Nuys, Calif., assembly
plant will be restored March 14, bringing 1,900 employees back full
time. The plant, which GM's only Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac
Firebird source, dropped the second shift last week.
   GM also will restore the second shift at its Oshawa No. 1 plant
in Oshawa, Ontario, bringing back 2,700 laid-off workers on March
21. The plant builds the Oldsmobile Cierra and Pontiac 6000.
   Meanwhile, GM said it would increase production at its Cadillac
plant in the Detroit enclave of Hamtramck by running its single
shift on overtime, adding 4,700 cars between Feb. 20 and June 1.
   Cadillac General Manager John Grettenberger said the increased
production was necessary because dealers need more of the restyled
Eldorado coupe and Seville sedans, whose popularity has been
boosted by availability of a new 4.5-liter V-8 engine.

<HEAD>Federated's Board To Consider Campeau Offer, Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federated Department Stores Inc.'s board of
directors on Thursday will consider a restructuring plan and an
extended merger offer from Toronto developer Campeau Corp., a
spokesman said.
   However, Jim Sluzewski declined Wednesday to disclose the site
for the gathering, which he described as a regular monthly meeting.
   The Cincinnati-based retailer, which operates the Bloomingdale's
department store chain, said the board will review Campeau's
extended $5.85 billion offer for a friendly merger.
   The directors also will review options for a restructuring to
avoid a takeover, including selling its non-department store
assets. Federated said it has been negotiating with unidentified
third parties that have shown an interest in acquiring the company
or its non-department store divisions.
   Federated has resisted Campeau's attempts to acquire the company
in either a friendly merger or a hostile takeover.
   On Monday, Campeau extended its offer to pay $66 per share for
Federated, which has 88.5 million outstanding shares, if the
retailer agrees to a definitive, friendly merger by midnight Friday.
   Campeau said if no agreement is reached by the Friday deadline,
the offer reverts to a hostile, $61-per-share offer.
   Federated has twice rejected Campeau's $66-per-share offer,
saying it didn't think the Toronto-based corporation has the
financing to complete such a deal.
   Federated has about 650 stores nationwide, with sales exceeding
$11 billion last year. It's non-department store assets include
Columbus-based Gold Circle stores, Ralphs supermarkets based in Los
Angeles, and specialty stores including The Children's Place in
Pine Brook, N.J., Filene's Basement in Boston, and MainStreet in
Chicago.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed to
higher Wednesday in fairly light trading on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Corn futures were the most consistent performers, showing
strength throughout the trading session on rumors that the Soviet
Union had purchased as much as 2 million bushels of U.S. corn
overnight, said Dale Gustafson, an analyst in Chicago for Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Soybean prices lagged for most of the day but ended mixed on a
late surge of buying led by C&D Commodities, a major player in
soybean trading, analysts said.
   Wheat futures ended slightly higher on talk of expected new
export sales to European countries, Gustafson said.
   Gains in wheat prices were limited by an increase in supplies of
wheat for near-term delivery, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents to 2{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March at $3.18 a bushel; corn was \ cent

<HEAD>Oil Prices Head Lower After Rally Bid Fizzles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil prices headed lower Wednesday after an early
attempt to rally fizzled.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, contracts for April
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil,
settled at $16.46 per 42-gallon barrel, down 14 cents from
Tuesday's close.
   Among March contracts for refined products, wholesale heating
oil settled at 46.40 cents a gallon, down 0.06 cent from Tuesday,
while wholesale unleaded gasoline closed 0.6 cent lower at 46.30
cents a gallon.
   Linda Simard, an analyst at the Drexel Burham Lambert Inc.
securities firm, said some traders were expecting prices to rise at
the start of the session in the wake of late Tuesday's weekly
report on weekly oil production and supplies.
   The report, issued by the Washington-based American Petroleum
Institute, a trade organization, showed a larger-than-expected
drawdown of heating oil inventories during the week ending last
Friday, but also a larger-than-expected increase in unleaded
gasoline supplies, she said.
   Crude inventories were also slightly lower, according to the
report.
   Ms. Simard said traders ``were looking to sell higher at the
start, but as disappointment set in, the sellers took over.''
   In the end, trading wound up being dominated by technical
factors more than anything else, she added.

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Mine Workers President Richard Trumka said
Wednesday he considers the union's failed merger with the Oil,
Chemical and Atomic Workers union ``a closed deal'' that won't be
reconsidered.
   OCAW's executive board on Tuesday voted 6-2 to reject a merger
that would have created the United Mine, Energy and Chemical
Workers of America from the two powerful unions. Trumka said the
OCAW board had left open the possibility of reconsidering the
merger, but the UMW's board voted Wednesday to rescind the approval
it gave on Sunday.
   ``I consider it a closed deal,'' Trumka told a news conference.
``Their board was willing to let it go to their constitutional
convention without a recommendation. I flatly rejected that.''
   OCAW spokesman Rod Rogers said the union's executive board was
still involved Wednesday in its regular meeting, and OCAW President
Joseph Misbrener was not immediately available for comment. Rogers
said the issue is not necessarily dead.
   ``It's always possible there could be a resurrection of the
idea,'' he said.
   ``There were compelling reasons why this merger was a good idea,
and those reasons haven't gone away,'' Rogers said. ``This
particular merger proposal is dead, yes, but we could take action
to re-initiate things.''
   Trumka said he was ready to move on, however.
   ``I'll come back at the next (UMW) board meeting and say, `That
didn't work; let's try something else,''' Trumka said. ``We're
going to pursue a policy of growth for our organization.''
   Trumka said the OCAW board rejected the merger agreement because
it ``wanted assurances there would be no dues increase in 1990,''
when the first constitutional convention of the combined union
would have taken place.
   ``There was no way possible I could guarantee that because
delegates at that convention determine what will happen,'' Trumka
said.
   The UMW president said he then convened a meeting of his union's
board, which rescinded its earlier approval of the merger
agreement, which contained no provisions for amendment.
   Trumka said both unions would continue to work together,
especially on negotiations with employers that the two unions have
in common.
   While he plans to look for other ways to expand the UMW's
influence, Trumka said, he does not consider it good policy ``to
merge just for the sake of merging.''

   Dart Group Corp. will continue its billion-dollar
hostile takeover bid for Stop & Shop Cos. Inc., which is
negotiating with several other potential buyers, a Dart spokesman
said Wednesday.
   Stop & Shop confirmed Wednesday it had begun talks with several
parties considering a buyout of the supermarket and discount store
chain, raising the possibility it might find a ``white knight''
friendly suitor to thwart Dart.
   Sandy Bouzoukis, a Stop & Shop spokeswoman, declined to name the
parties interested in the Braintree-based company.
   Dart spokesman Stanley Rubenstein said the Landover, Md.-based
retailing concern would continue its hostile $37 a share, $1.03
billion tender offer launched last month. Dart controls about 2.7
percent of Stop & Shop's 27.9 million common shares outstanding.
   ``Dart's position is unchanged. It is premature to respond to
(Stop & Shop) until we know the details of any alternative
proposal,'' said Rubenstein.
   Stop & Shop rose $2.37{ to $41.50 a share Wednesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Boston businessman Thomas Lee reportedly is a possible suitor,
but neither Lee nor Stop & Shop officials would confirm they were
in negotiations.
   Stop & Shop directors rejected Dart's $37 a share offer earlier
this month and filed a federal court suit to block the bid,
claiming Dart did not fully disclose details of past takeover
attempts and had failed to register as an investment company with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Dart countersued, claiming Stop & Shop illegally withheld
corporate information.
   U.S. District Judge Rya Zobel ruled Tuesday that Dart must file
its claim in Norfolk Superior Court in Massachusetts, where eight
separate shareholder suits challenging Stop & Shop's anti-takeover
measures are awaiting a hearing.
   Dart has mounted several unsuccessful but profitable hostile
takeover attempts since selling its Washington-based drug store
chain in 1985.
   The bid for Stop & Shop was Dart's first since it abandoned a $6
billion takeover proposal for Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp.
following the Oct. 19 stock market crash.
   Dart, which owns Crown Books and Trak Auto Parts stores
nationwide, also has made unsuccessful but profitable attempts to
gain control of Safeway Co. and Supermarkets General.
   Since 1986, Stop & Shop has sold several unprofitable divisions,
including Medi Mart drug stores and Almys department stores, and
laid off about 450 middle-level workers.
   The company operates 113 Stop & Shop supermarkets and 169
Bradlees discount department stores.

<TEXT>
   Honda Motor Co. Ltd. posted a 38.1 percent rise in
profits in the latest three-month period, even though operating
income fell, the company said Tuesday.
   Net income rose to 23.68 billion Japanese yen, or about $193
million, from 17.1 billion yen in a corresponding reporting period
in 1986.
   Honda is shifting to a new fiscal year, so results for the three
months ended Dec. 31, 1987, were compared with results for the
period ended Nov. 30, 1986. Dollar equivalents were based on an
exchange rate of 123 yen to the dollar prevailing at the end of
1987.
   Revenue rose 20.5 percent to 789.5 billion yen, or about $6.42
billion, from 655.3 billion yen a year earlier.
   Honda's income from operations fell 31.4 percent to 32.4 billion
yen, or $263 million, in the quarter, mainly because of the falling
value of the dollar, which decreases the value of U.S. sales when
measured in yen.
   However, Honda's net profit rose because of successful
foreign-exchange trading and decreased income taxes, among other
factors, the company said.

<HEAD>FTC Seeks to Block Glass Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission asked a federal
appeals court Tuesday to stop the merger of two of the nation's
largest manufacturers of glass containers while it appeals a lower
court's refusal to halt the deal.
   The FTC asked the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for a
preliminary injunction to prevent Owens-Illinois Inc., the nation's
second-largest glass container manufacturer, from acquiring
Brockway Inc. for $750 million during the appeal.
   The FTC, which obtained a provisional stay from the appellate
court on Friday, contended that U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens
Green ``erred, both factually and legally, in holding that the
merger is not likely to have anticompetitive effects.''
   The FTC contends that the merger, which would create the
nation's largest glass container manufacturer, would reduce
competition and raise the price of bottles, jars and other
containers the companies make for food, soft drinks and liquor.
   Green, who last week denied the FTC's bid to stop the merger
pending administrative proceedings within the agency, accepted the
companies' argument that competition from plastic and paper
packaging would keep down the prices of glass containers.
   But the FTC said she ``disregarded extensive testimony by
customers accounting for more than $450 million in annual glass
container purchases that they will not or cannot economically
switch from glass containers to other package forms.''
   The agency said Green's opinion ``disregards, without
explanation, long-established legal standards for assessing the
potential anticompetitive effects of horizontal mergers, including
the significance of market concentration and entry barriers, as
well as extensive customer testimony that prices are likely to rise
as a result of the merger.''
   The FTC has stalled the merger since Owens-Illinois, based in
Toledo, Ohio, made its tender offer last September to buy Brockway
stock for $60 a share. Green had granted a temporary restraining
order halting the merger while she reviewed the case, but she
refused to grant a preliminary injunction.
   Owens-Illinois controls 22.7 percent of the market while
Brockway, based in Jacksonville, Fla., controls 15 percent of sales.

<TEXT>
   Litton Industries Inc. said
Wednesday its net earnings rose 19 percent in the second quarter,
mainly because of improvements in its resource-exploration and
industrial-automation units.
   The high-technology conglomerate netted $40.7 million, or $1.56
a share, for the three months ended Jan. 31, up from $34.1 million,
or $1.28 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the second quarter rose 19.6 percent, to $1.16
billion from $974.5 million.
   Litton's profit also rose 19 percent in the half. The company
earned $81.3 million, or $3.07 a share, up from $68.4 million, or
$2.54 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 15.2 percent, to $2.35
billion from $2.04 billion.
   Litton's biggest improvement was in the resource-exploration and
industrial-automation units of its industrial systems and services
division, in part because of acquisitions. For the half, earnings
for the division jumped 183 percent to $65.7 million and revenue
rose 78.5 percent to $775.3 million.

<HEAD>Gold Futures Hammered To 11-Month Low; Better Economic Outlook
Cited</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices plunged to the lowest level in 11 months
Wednesday, possibly reflecting a change in attitude among investors
who had been expecting a surge in inflation, analysts said.
   On other markets, grain and soybean futures settled mostly
higher, livestock and meat futures were mixed; energy futures
retreated; and stock-index futures declined.
   Wednesday marked the second consecutive day of sharp declines in
futures prices for gold and other precious metals, which had traded
listlessly in narrow ranges for nearly a month.
   Tuesday's drop in prices was widely attributed to Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's prediction that the 1988 U.S.
inflation rate would average 3.25 percent to 3.75 percent, a rate
lower than many market experts had projected.
   Demand and prices for precious metals typically rise during
inflationary periods because they tend to hold their value better
than other investments.
   Greenspan's forecast, along a general weakening of commodity
prices recently, may have prompted a shift in attitude among
investors who feared the worst after the October stock market
collapse, said Craig Sloane, an analyst in New York for Smith
Barney, Harris Upham & Co.
   ``It seems to me that the market is getting more encouraged, in
terms of inflation, that things are not going to get worse,''
Sloane said.
   He said the confidence Greenspan displayed in his testimony
Tuesday before a House Banking subcommittee ``seemed to enhance his
credibility,'' which in turn may have given the markets more
confidence.
   Citibank analyst Sharon Ziemian said Wednesday's selloff of gold
futures appeared to spread from European markets to the U.S.
markets, including New York's Commodity Exchange, the country's
major market for precious metals futures.
   ``The selling was substantial enough that, with only a limited
amount of buying, it pushed the market down dramatically,'' Ms.
Ziemian said.
   On the Commodity Exchange, gold settled $9.90 to $13.90 lower
with the contract for delivery in April at $434.10 a troy ounce,
the contract's lowest price since March 20, 1987; silver was 10.5
cents to 13.4 cents lower with March at $6.195 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures ended mostly higher in fairly light
trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Corn was the most consistent performer, showing strength
throughout the session on rumors that the Soviet Union had
purchased as much as 2 million metric tons of U.S. corn overnight,
said Dale Gustafson, an analyst in Chicago for Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   The Agriculture Department announced after the close that the
Soviets had bought 350,000 metric tons of U.S. corn.
   Soybeans lagged for the most of the day but ended mixed on a
late surge of buying led by C&D Commodities, a major player in the
soybean pit, analysts said.
   Wheat ended slightly higher on talk of expected new export sales
to European nations, Gustafson said.
   Wheat settled { cent to 2{ cents higher with March at $3.17 a
bushel; corn was { cent to 2{ cents higher with March at $1.99 a
bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent lower with March at $1.90\ a
bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 3} cents higher with March at
$6.24} a bushel.
   Cattle futures settled mostly higher while pork futures ended
mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle futures were supported by higher cash values but limited
by sluggish wholesale demand for beef, said Charlie Richardson, an
analyst in Denver for Lind-Waldock & Co.
   Lower cash prices pressured pork, he said.
   Live cattle settled .20 cent to .43 cent higher with April at
72.20 a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .45 cent higher
with March at 80.92 cents a pound; hogs were .62 cent lower to .45
cent higher with April at 44.12 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .12 cent lower to .47 cent higher with March at 52.27 cents a
pound.
   Oil prices slipped lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange on
technical factors after an early attempt to rally fizzled, analysts
said.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 3 cents to 14 cents
lower with February at 15.76 a barrel; heating oil was .06 cent to
.52 cent lower with March at 46.40 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .15 cent to .55 cent lower with March at 46.35 cents a
gallon.
   Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, where the contract for March delivery of the Standard &
Poor's 500 index settled .30 point lower at 265.20. The underlying
spot index was off .58 point at 264.44.

   Gold prices tumbled Wednesday as traders
appeared to take a more optimistic view of chances for continued
low inflation.
   The dollar, meanwhile, turned in a narrowly mixed performance on
the world's foreign-exchange markets.
   Republic National Bank of New York quoted a bid price for gold
of $432.80 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EST, down $8.70 from Tuesday's
late level.
   Analysts who follow the precious metals markets said recent
declines in commodity prices have convinced many traders that
inflation poses little immediate threat to the economy, diminishing
gold's appeal as a hedge against rising prices.
   ``They expect inflation to be moderate to subdued and that gives
them very little reason to own gold,'' said Gary Dorsch, an analyst
for LNS Financial Group Inc. in Chicago.
   He said some traders have been liquidating tangible assets such
as gold in anticipation of investing the proceeds in the stock
market, which has shown some strength over the past two weeks.
   But Jeffrey A. Nichols, president of American Precious Metals
Advisors Inc. in New York, said the latest decline in gold prices
simply extends a trend begun late in 1987, reflecting heavier
supplies in a sluggish market.
   He said the Soviet Union has sold considerable amounts of gold
and mining companies have become more aggressive about selling
contracts for what they expect to mine.
   At the same time, investors have shown little interest in gold
because of ``low inflation expectations, stable world equity
markets, a strong U.S. bond market and rising confidence in the
Federal Reserve Board,'' Nichols said.
   ``It is not that there has been a massive selloff. It is just
that there is a lack of willingness to buy gold except at lower
prices,'' he said.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery fell
$9.90 a troy ounce to $431.90.
   In London, gold fell to $434.70 a troy ounce from $442.50 late
Tuesday. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold fell to $436 from $442 late
Tuesday.
   Gold fell to $444.20 an ounce in Hong Kong from $446.80 late
Tuesday.
   Silver bullion fell in London to $6.26 a troy ounce from $6.33
late Tuesday. Latewr on New York's Comex, silver for current
delivery fell 10 cents an ounce to $6.19.
   In the foreign-exchange markets, the dollar traded in a narrow
range for most of the day, ending mixed against the world's major
currencies.
   Dealers said traders were anxiously awaiting the scheduled
release on Thursday of revised figures on the U.S. gross national
product for the fourth quarter. They said the consensus was that
the growth rate would be revised upward from earlier estimates.
   Dorsch said the dollar drew some support from Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's remarks to a congressional panel that
``he was not in favor of driving the dollar lower to increase
exports.''
   But the dollar wound up lower in New York against the Japanese,
Canadian, Italian and British currencies, while it edged up against
those of West Germany, France and Switzerland.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 128.75 Japanese yen from 128.50 yen
late Tuesday. Later in London, the dollar traded at 128.57 yen. The
dollar slipped to 128.82 yen in New York from 129.00 yen late
Tuesday.
   The British pound fell to $1.7640 in London from $1.7655 late
Tuesday. Later in New York, the pound edged up to $1.76355 from
$1.76325 on Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Tuesday, included: 1.69575 West German marks, up from 1.69475;
1.39535 Swiss francs, up from 1.39325; 5.7340 French francs, up
from 5.7330; 1,248.00 Italian lire, down from 1,248.50; and 1.26505
Canadian dollars, down from 1.26765.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Tuesday, included: 1.6925 West German marks, down from 1.6945;
1.3908 Swiss francs, up from 1.3895; 5.7240 French francs,
unchanged; 1.8990 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9000; 1,246.25

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on
Wednesday criticized what he said was administration pressure for
lower interest rates, but President Reagan denied knowledge of such
an effort and voiced support for the Fed chairman.
   In congressional testiony, Greenspan had cautioned that further
White House efforts to influence the central bank could boomerang.
He referred in particular to a letter written by a Treasury
Department official pleading for easier credit.
   Asked at his Wednesday night news conference about Greenspan's
complaint, and whether he still had confidence in Greenspan, Reagan
replied: ``Yes I do. And I'm going to have to find out what this is
all about that you're talking about, because nothing of that kind
had been directed to me.''
   Greenspan, who was appointed to the Fed post by Reagan last
summer, issued his warning as the administration sought to dampen
its dispute with the central bank.
   Beryl Sprinkel, the president's chief economic adviser, said the
administration currently is ``delighted with monetary policy.''
   Greenspan, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, was
highly critical of a letter sent by Assistant Treasury Secretary
Michael Darby to top Fed policy-makers 10 days before they were to
meet to set monetary growth targets for 1988.
   The Fed tries to supply enough money to the economy to support
sustained growth while guarding against over-doing money creation
and thus re-igniting inflation. Both Darby and Srinkel have
complained that the money supply grew so sluggishly in 1987 that it
raised concerns about a possible recession during this election
year.
   The Darby letter was brought up in questioning by Sen. William
Proxmire, D-Wis., who cited it as just one of numerous examples of
administration pressure on the Fed. While Proxmire did not release
the text of Darby's letter, the senator said the clear implication
was that the administration was pressuring the Fed to ``ease up on
the money.''
   He said Darby's letter to each member of the Federal Open Market
Committee was the most overt effort he had ever seen on the part of
the administration to influence Fed decision-making.
   ``I think it is both deplorable and counterproductive for the
Reagan administration to pressure you as much as they have in
recent months,'' Proxmire said.
   Greenspan said while the central bank was not being unduly
influenced by the administration, he was worried about the
perceptions in financial markets.
   ``The only thing that I hope does not happen is that the concern
of our responding to political pressures gets so extraordinary that
we will feel the necessity to do precisely the opposite,''
Greenspan said.
   Greenspan said, ``When I heard about Dr. Darby's letter I
objected quite strongly. As best I can judge, he was not aware of
the implications of doing this just prior to an FOMC meeting.''
   Greenspan indicated he had received assurances that there would
be no repeat of the Darby letter.
   Greenspan and the other four members of the Federal Reserve
Board were all appointed by President Reagan, the first time one
president has named all members of the board since Franklin
Roosevelt. There is one vacancy.
   The normal Fed term is 14 years, a tenure designed to insulate
the board from political pressures and also make it harder for one
president to name all the board members.
   Proxmire said the current situation was raising concerns that
the central bank would bend to administration pressure and boost
money growth so much during this election year that the country
would suffer another round of debilitating inflation in 1989.
   Greenspan did not say which administration official he contacted
concerning the Darby letter, but it has been reported that Treasury
Secretary James A. Baker III was instrumental in toning down
criticism of the Fed in the Economic Report of the President issued
last week.
   Sprinkel, in a separate appearance Wednesday before the House
Budget Committee, said that while he believed the Fed had been too
stingy in supplying money to the economy last year, things have
improved in the past six weeks.
   ``Since that time, we've been delighted with monetary policy,''
Sprinkel said. ``They're dedicated to a policy of moderate
expansion. ... They have the power to do it, and I'm confident they
will do it.''

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan says
the risk of a recession is as great as the risk of renewed
inflation, but he agrees with the Reagan administration that
neither appears imminent.
   Greenspan made his remarks Tuesday during the Fed's semi-annual
congressional testimony on its conduct of monetary policy.
   Greenspan also confirmed that the central bank had eased credit
slightly a few weeks ago in an effort to keep the economic
expansion alive.

   Orders to U.S. factories for ``big ticket''
durable goods fell 2.8 percent in January, the biggest decline in a
year, according to the Commerce Department.
   Durable goods orders fell to a seasonally adjusted $112.23
billion last month, a drop of $3.28 billion from December,
reflecting sharp drops in demand for aircraft and primary metals,
the government said Tuesday.
   The steep decline followed a December advance of 4.1 percent,
which was the strongest rise since March.

   A Massachusetts electric holding company
has begun talks aimed at taking over ailing Public Service Company
of New Hampshire, except for its 36 percent share of the stalled
Seabrook nuclear plant.
   Public Service, the lead Seabrook owner, filed for federal
bankruptcy protection last month.
   New England Electric System, based in Westborough, Mass., said
Tuesday the potential takeover would let Public Service pay its
share of Seabrook preparation costs while its owners keep trying to
get an operating license.

   A federal judge has ruled Occidental
Chemical Corp. is liable for the estimated $250 million cost of
cleaning up the Love Canal landfill that became synonymous with
environmental disaster.
   After nine years of deliberations, U.S. District Judge John
Curtin said Tuesday that Occidental produced the wastes that
created the disaster and stored them in a way that would eventually
result in toxic leakage.
   Occidental spokesman James Green said the company was
disappointed by the ruling but would not comment until its
attorneys had studied the decision.

   Grammy Goose met Granny Goose in court
on Tuesday to decide an issue that has ruffled a lot of feathers.
   Granny Goose Foods Inc. has accused the Grammy Goose Baby
Boutique of ``diluting'' the food company's name and logo. Granny
has asked for a preliminary injunction against Grammy.
   Granny Goose, the nation's third largest potato chip
manufacturer, is arguing the boutique in nearby Petaluma has
created confusion by using a similar name.
   The name and logo ``represent the most valuable asset my client
owns,'' Granny attorney Kate Spellman told Sonoma County Superior
Court Judge Lloyd von der Mehden. ``Where there is confusion,
dilution has occurred.''
   Sandy Gotelli, the Petaluma grandmother who owns the baby shop,
said she'll be forced out of business if the injunction is granted.
She said she picked the name by combining her liking for geese with
her granddaughter's nickname for her.
   Ms. Spellman told the court the company made a three-point offer
to Grammy Goose: to help design a new sign, to help phase out
printed paper goods and to help find a new name that retains part
of the current name.
   ``We understand she is a small business and we would like to
mitigate the harm to her,'' Ms. Spellman said.
   She acknowledged there had ``not been a great decrease in
sales,'' but said the case had resulted in negative publicity for
the corporation.
   The judge gave Mrs. Gotelli one week to respond in writing to
the points made by Ms. Spellman. Granny Goose's attorneys then will
have another five days to respond.

<HEAD>United Sued Over Computer Reservations System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   System One Direct Access Inc., a Texas Air Corp.
affiliate that markets a computer reservations system to travel
agents, filed an antitrust lawsuit Tuesday against United Airlines,
which runs a rival system.
   System One described in its complaint a pattern of actions
undertaken by Chicago-based United since 1984 to inhibit
competition and unfairly preserve market dominance.
   The lawsuit, filed in a Houston federal court, says that
United's action also violated regulations adopted by the Civil
Aeronautics Board in 1984, which prohibit airlines that own a
System One computer reservations system from directly or indirectly
prohibiting travel agents from obtaining or using another system.
   The anticompetitive actions undertaken by United, according to
the lawsuit, include rollover requirements, which extend the
contract for a new five-year term every time the agent adds new
equipment or services and punitive damages clauses based on future
airline booking fees, which may amount to hundreds of thousands of
dollars in the event an agent switches systems.
   The lawsuit also alleges that United Airlines' contractural
clauses prevent travel agents from using additional systems and the
filings of lawsuits against individual travel agencies that select
an alternative computer system vendor.
   Matthew Gonring, spokesman for United, said he was aware of the
lawsuit but would not comment further.
   Texas Air is the parent company of Eastern and Continental
airlines.
   United, through an affiliated company called Covia Corp,
operates Apollo, the second largest computerized reservation system
in the country behind American Sabre, affiliated with American
Airlines. System One is third.
